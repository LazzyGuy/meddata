This differentiation process is controlled by transcription factors that establish stage- and cell type-specific gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that FUSE binding protein 1 (FUBP1), a transcriptional regulator important for HSC self-renewal and survival, is regulated by T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1 (TAL1) in erythroid progenitor cells. TAL1 directly activates the FUBP1 promoter, leading to increased FUBP1 expression during erythroid differentiation. The binding of TAL1 to the FUBP1 promoter is highly dependent on an intact GATA sequence in a combined E-box/GATA motif. We found that FUBP1 expression is required for efficient erythropoiesis, as FUBP1-deficient progenitor cells were limited in their potential of erythroid differentiation. Thus, the finding of an interconnection between GATA1/TAL1 and FUBP1 reveals a molecular mechanism that is part of the switch from progenitor- to erythrocyte-specific gene expression. In summary, we identified a TAL1/FUBP1 transcriptional relationship, whose physiological function in haematopoiesis is connected to proper erythropoiesis.",Central modulation of parasympathetic outflow is impaired in de novo Parkinson's disease patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653564,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Task- and stimulus-based neuroimaging studies have begun to unveil the central autonomic network which modulates autonomic nervous system activity. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the central autonomic network without the bias constituted by the use of a task. Additionally, we assessed whether this circuitry presents signs of dysregulation in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition which may be associated with dysautonomia. We combined heart-rate-variability based methods for time-varying assessments of the autonomic nervous system outflow with resting-state fMRI in 14 healthy controls and 14 de novo PD patients, evaluating the correlations between fMRI time-series and the instantaneous high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum, a marker of parasympathetic outflow. In control subjects, the high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum was significantly anti-correlated with fMRI time-series in several cortical, subcortical and brainstem regions. This complex central network was not detectable in PD patients. In between-group analysis, we found that in healthy controls the brain activation related to the high-frequency component of the heart-rate-variability power spectrum was significantly less than in PD patients in the mid and anterior cingulum, sensorimotor cortex and supplementary motor area, insula and temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and in a region encompassing posterior cingulum, precuneus and parieto-occipital cortex. Our results indicate that the complex central network which modulates parasympathetic outflow in the resting state is impaired in the early clinical stages of PD.",Interprofessional education in medical schools in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653563,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Interprofessional education (IPE) for medical students is becoming increasingly important, as reflected in the increasing number of medical schools adopting IPE. However, the current status of and barriers to pre-registration IPE implementation in Japanese medical schools remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to clarify the status and barriers of IPE implementation in medical schools in Japan. We conducted a curriculum survey from September to December 2016 of all 81 medical schools in Japan. We mailed the questionnaire and asked the schools' undergraduate education staff to respond. The survey items were the IPE implementation status and barriers to program implementation. Sixty-four of the 81 schools responded (response rate 79.0%), of which 46 (71.9%) had implemented IPE, 42 (89.1%) as compulsory programs. Half of IPE programs were implemented in the first 2 years, while less than 10% were implemented in the latter years of medical programs. As part of the IPE programs, medical students collaborated with a wide range of professional student groups. The most common learning strategy was lectures. However, one-third of IPE programs used didactic lectures without interaction between multi-professional students. The most common perceived major barrier to implementing IPE was adjustment of the academic calendar and schedule (82.8%), followed by insufficient staff numbers (73.4%). Our findings indicate that IPE is being promoted in undergraduate education at medical schools in Japan. IPE programs differed according to the circumstances of each school. Barriers to IPE may be resolved by improving learning methods, introducing group discussions between multi-professional students in lectures or introducing IPE programs using team-based learning. In summary, we demonstrated the current status and barriers of IPE implementation in Japanese medical schools. Our findings will likely lead to the promotion of IPE programs in Japan.",Evaluation of five rapid diagnostic tests for detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV): A step towards scale-up of HCV screening efforts in India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653562,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and curative treatment of HCV can reduce the risk of liver-related mortality and serve to prevent transmission of new infections. India is estimated to have about six million HCV infected individuals, most of whom are unaware of their infection status. Rapid diagnostic test kits (RDTs) could help identify HCV infected persons more expeditiously and thus availability of high performing, quality-assured RDTs is essential to scale-up HCV screening efforts. The present study was thus undertaken to evaluate the performance characteristics of five anti-HCV RDTs.",Multigenerational prediction of genetic values using genome-enabled prediction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653561,PloS one,2019 01 31,"The identification of elite individuals is a critical component of most breeding programs. However, the achievement of this goal is limited by the high cost of phenotyping and experimental research. A significant benefit of genomic selection (GS) to plant breeding is the identification of elite individuals without the need for phenotyping. This study aimed to propose different calibration strategies using combinations between generations from different genetic backgrounds to improve the reliability of GS and to investigate the effects of LD in different types of mating systems: outcrossing (An) self-pollination (Sn) and hybridization (Hn). For this purpose, we simulated a genome with 10 linkage groups. In each group, two QTL were simulated. Subsequently, an F2 population was created, followed by four generations of inbreeding (S1 to S4, H1 to H 4, A1, to A4,). Quantitative traits were simulated in three scenarios considering three degrees of dominance (d/a = 0, 0.5 and 1) and two broad sense heritabilities (h2 = 0.30 and 0.70), totaling six genetic architectures. To evaluate prediction reliability, a model (RR-BLUP) was trained in one generation and used to predict the following generations of mating systems. For example, the marker effects estimated in the F2 population were used to estimate the expected genomic breeding value (GEBV) in populations S1 through A4. The squared correlation between the GEBV and the true genetic value were used to measure the reliability of the predictions. Independently of the population used to estimate the marker effect, reliability showed the lowest values in the scenario where d = 1. For any scenario, the use of the multigenerational prediction methodology improved the reliability of GS.",Comparison of monocular sensitivities measured with and without occlusion using the head-mounted perimeter imo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653560,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Using a head-mounted perimeter imo that can measure monocular sensitivity with both eyes open, we investigated the difference between monocular sensitivities measured with and without occlusion of the fellow eye and if the difference was influenced by eccentricity.",Molecular features of premenopausal breast cancers in Latin American women: Pilot results from the PRECAMA study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653559,PloS one,2019 01 31,"In Latin America (LA), there is a high incidence rate of breast cancer (BC) in premenopausal women, and the genomic features of these BC remain unknown.

Several studies reported that the G8 questionnaire had a high sensitivity for predicting abnormalities in the full comprehensive geriatric assessment and predicted functional decline and survival in elderly cancer patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of the G8 questionnaire for predicting clinical outcomes and overall survival (OS) in elderly patients with lung cancer, who received chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The data of 101 lung cancer patients aged ≥70 years, who were hospitalized between September 2011 and August 2014, were analyzed. Of these patients (median age, 77 years), 83 (82%) had impaired G8 scores. The proportion of patients with an impaired G8 score was significantly higher in patients aged ≥80 years than those aged <80 years (p = 0.04). All 18 patients with a normal G8 score possessed an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and none of the patients with a normal G8 score had an ECOG PS of ≥2 (p < 0.0001). An impaired G8 score tended to correlate with a relative dose intensity of <0.65 in patients who received chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.05, odds ratio = 5.40). In the univariate analysis, an ECOG PS of ≥2 and an impaired G8 score were significantly associated with a poor OS (p = 0.009 and p = 0.003, respectively). Moreover, in the multivariate analysis, an ECOG PS of ≥2 (HR 2.55; 95% CI, 1.23-5.30; p = 0.01) and an impaired G8 score (HR 3.86; 95% CI, 1.44-13.36; p = 0.006) were remained independent prognostic factor for OS. G8 screening tool is useful for the prognostication of elderly lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. These finding suggest that the G8 questionnaire could be a useful tool in treatment decision-making to predict prognosis and prevent patients from receiving inappropriate anti-cancer treatment near the end of life.",LncRNA expression profile and ceRNA analysis in tomato during flowering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653557,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play essential regulatory roles in various developmental processes and stress responses. However, the functions of lncRNAs during the flowering period of tomato are largely unknown. To explore the lncRNA profiles and functions during flowering in tomato, we performed strand-specific paired-end RNA sequencing of tomato leaves, flowers and roots, with three biological replicates. We identified 10919 lncRNAs including 248 novel lncRNAs, of which 65 novel lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (DE) in the flowers, leaves, and roots. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were carried out to identify the cis target gene of DE lncRNAs. The results showed that the lncRNAs might play an important role in the growth, development, and apoptosis of flowering tomato plant by regulating the formation of intima in flower tissues, binding to various molecules, influencing metabolic pathways, and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, we identified the interaction between 32, 78, and 397 kinds of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs. The results suggest that the lncRNAs can regulate the expression of mRNA during flowering period in tomato by forming competitive endogenous RNA, and further regulate various biological metabolism pathways in tomato."

Yet, often user groups are socioculturally heterogeneous, which requires cooperation to be established across salient group boundaries. We explore the effect of this type of heterogeneity on resource extraction in lab-in-the-field Common Pool Resource (CPR) experiments in Zanzibar, Tanzania. We create heterogeneous groups by mixing fishers from two neighbouring fishing villages which have distinct social identities, a history of conflict and diverging resource use practices and institutions. Additionally, we analyse between-village differences in extraction behaviour in the heterogeneous setting to assess if out-group cooperation in a CPR dilemma is associated with a community's institutional scope in the economic realm (e.g., degree of market integration). We find no aggregate effect of heterogeneity on extraction. However, this is because fishers from the two villages behave differently in the heterogeneity treatment. We find support for the hypothesis that cooperation under sociocultural heterogeneity is higher for fishers from the village with larger institutional scope. In line with this explanation, cooperation under heterogeneity also correlates with a survey measure of individual fishers' radius of trust. We discuss implications for resource governance and collective action research.","Open-source food: Nutrition, toxicology, and availability of wild edible greens in the East Bay.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653545,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Foraged leafy greens are consumed around the globe, including in urban areas, and may play a larger role when food is scarce or expensive.

LEP is typically measured with specialized and expensive equipment, which limits the large-scale applicability. Previously, sensor-based trunk kinematics have been used to estimate the vertical power required to elevate the body's center of mass during functional tests, but the link with LEP and age remains to be investigated. Therefore, we investigated whether a body-fixed sensor-based analysis of power during stair ascent (SA) and sit-to-stand (STS) is positively related to LEP and whether its ability to detect age-related declines is similar. In addition, the effect of load during SA and STS was investigated. 98 adults (20-70 years) performed a leg press to assess LEP, SA and 5-repetition STS tests. In SA and STS, two conditions were tested: unloaded and loaded (+10% body mass). An inertial measurement unit was used to analyze (sub)-durations and vertical power. SA and STS power were more related to LEP than duration parameters (i.e. 0.80-0.81 for power and -0.41 --0.66 for duration parameters, p < 0.05). The average annual age-related percent change was higher in SA power (-1.38%) than in LEP (-0.86%) and STS power (-0.38%) (p < 0.05). Age explained 29% in SA power (p < 0.001), as opposed to 14% in LEP (p < 0.001) and a non-significant 2% in STS power (p = 0.102). The addition of 10% load did not influence the age-related decline of SA and STS power nor the relationship with LEP. These results demonstrate the potential of SA tests to detect age-related deterioration in neuromuscular function. SA seems more sensitive to detect age-related changes than LEP, probably because of the additional balance component and plantar- and dorsiflexor activity. On the contrary, STS is less sensitive to age-related changes because of a ceiling effect in well-functioning adults.",Real-life study of dual therapy based on dolutegravir and ritonavir-boosted darunavir in HIV-1-infected treatment-experienced patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653541,PloS one,2019 01 31,Dual therapy based on dolutegravir and ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DTG/DRV/r) is a combination of well-known drugs with a high genetic barrier to HIV resistance.,The association between perceived household educational support and HIV risk in young women in a rural South African community (HPTN 068): A cross sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653540,PloS one,2019 04 23,"To characterise perceived household support for female education and the associations between educational support and HIV prevalence, HSV-2 prevalence and sexual risk behaviours.",Effect of cardio-metabolic risk factors on all-cause mortality among HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy in Malawi: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653539,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among people living with HIV is elevated due to persistent inflammation, hypertension and diabetes comorbidity, lifestyle factors and exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART).

An econometric assessment of the link between soil nutrients and malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653538,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Malnutrition, the suboptimal consumption of essential nutrients like zinc, severely affects human health. This burden of malnutrition falls disproportionally heavy on developing countries, directly increasing child mortality and childhood stunting, or reducing people's ability mending diseases. One option to combat malnutrition is to blend missing nutrients in crop fertilizers, thereby increasing crop yields and possibly the nutrient density in harvested crop products, thus enriching crop products destined for human consumption. But, the effectiveness of so-called agronomic fortification remains ill-understood, primarily due to a paucity of field trials. We hypothesize that, if at all this is an effective strategy, there should exist a causal link between malnutrition and natural variation in the quality of soils to begin with. Until now, data limitations prevented the establishment of such a link, but new soil micronutrient maps for Sub-Saharan Africa allow for a detailed assessment. In doing so, we find statistically significant relations between soil nutrients and child mortality, stunting, wasting and underweight. For instance, a simultaneous increase in soil densities of copper, manganese and zinc by one standard deviation reduces child mortality by 4-6 per mille points, but only when malaria pressure is modest. The effects of soil nutrients on health dissipate when malaria pressure increases. Yet, the effects are fairly small in magnitude suggesting that except for a few regions, agronomic fortification is a relatively cost ineffective means to combat malnutrition.","Formal comment on ""Systematic review of the predictors of statin adherence for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653537,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Statins have been prescribed for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for nearly 3 decades. Throughout this period key opinion leaders in the field have been dismayed by the high rate of non-adherence of patients to follow their statin regimen. Hope et al., [1] have addressed this issue by providing a systematic review of research on predictors of statin adherence for primary prevention of CVD. However, their review does not address the ongoing debate as to whether statin treatment is warranted for primary prevention of CVD, nor does it adequately address concerns regarding adverse effects of statins. We have therefore written a commentary which provides a broader perspective on the benefits versus harms of statin therapy. Our perspective of the literature is that non-adherence to statin treatment for primary prevention of CVD is justified because the meager benefits are more than offset by the extensive harms."

These truncations gradually convert native octameric enolase into monomers and oligomers. In this work, we investigated how these truncations influence the interaction between Streptococcal enolase and canine plasminogen. We used dual polarization interferometry (DPI), localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to study the interaction. The DPI was our first technique, was performed on all the truncations and used one exclusive kind of chip. The LSRP was used to show that the DPI results were not dependent on the type of chip used. The AUC was required to show that our surface results were not the result of selecting a minority population in any given sample; the majority of the protein was responsible for the binding phenomenon we observed. By comparing results from these techniques we identified one detail that is essential for streptococcal enolase to bind plasminogen: In our hands the individual monomers bind plasminogen; dimers, trimers, tetramers may or may not bind, the fully intact, native, octamer does not bind plasminogen. We also evaluated the contribution to the equilibrium constant made by surface binding as well as in solution. On a surface, the association coefficient is about twice that in solution. The difference is probably not significant. Finally, the fully octameric form of the protein that does not contain a hexa-his N-terminal peptide does not bind to a silicon oxynitride surface, does not bind to an Au-nanoparticle surface, does not bind to a surface coated with Ni-NTA nor does it bind to a surface coated with DPgn. The likelihood is great that the enolase species on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes is an x-mer of the native octamer.",No evidence for effects of Turkish immigrant children's bilingualism on executive functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653525,PloS one,2019 02 01,"Recent research has increasingly questioned the bilingual advantage for executive functions (EF).

If past errors reflect a fundamental difference in representation or complexity of computation, we would expect the same asymmetry in this task. We observed that adults were able to successfully predict the target referent for both types of only-sentences, as indicated by anticipatory looks, while 6- to 8-year-old children could do so only for subject-modifying only-sentences.

For example, recent experiments where ferrets were exposed to two influenza strains within a short period of time have shown how the effects of cross-immunity vary with the time between exposures and the specific strains used. On the other hand, studies of the workings of different arms of the immune response, and their relative importance, typically use experiments involving a single infection. However, inferring the relative importance of different immune components from this type of data is challenging. Using simulations and mathematical modelling, here we investigate whether the sequential infection experiment design can be used not only to determine immune components contributing to cross-protection, but also to gain insight into the immune response during a single infection. We show that virological data from sequential infection experiments can be used to accurately extract the timing and extent of cross-protection. Moreover, the broad immune components responsible for such cross-protection can be determined. Such data can also be used to infer the timing and strength of some immune components in controlling a primary infection, even in the absence of serological data. By contrast, single infection data cannot be used to reliably recover this information. Hence, sequential infection data enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control and resolution of infection, and generates new insight into how previous exposure influences the time course of a subsequent infection.",Nanoparticle-based CT visualization of pulmonary vasculature for minimally-invasive thoracic surgery planning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653521,PloS one,2019 02 01,"To evaluate CF800, a novel lipid-based liposomal nanoparticle that co-encapsulates indocyanine green (ICG) and iohexol, for CT imaging of pulmonary vasculature in minimally-invasive thoracic surgery planning.",Differential modulation and prognostic values of immune-escape genes in uveal melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653520,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults.

Genes of interest included MHC Class I and Class II molecules, as well as inhibitory immune-checkpoints, i.e. PDL1, PDL2, B7-H3, B7-H4, TBFRSF6B, CD47, CD155, GAL9, HVEM and CD200. We observed significant lower levels of MHC genes in UM cells as compared to normal uveal melanocytes. Unexpectedly however, the expression levels of most of the analyzed inhibitory immune-checkpoint genes were not different in cancer cells as compared to normal melanocytes, with the exception of CD200 and HVEM, that resulted significantly reduced. On the other hand, PDL1 inversely correlated with OS, PFS and thickness of the tumor. Also, PDL1, along with PDL2, expression significantly increased under inflammatory conditions. Finally, for the first time, we propose a possible role for CD47 in the immune evasive properties of UM. We show here that CD47 is significantly upregulated by UM cells following inflammatory stimuli and that it represents a good independent predictor of disease progression. The results from this study may propel advances in the development of immune-based therapies for UM patients.",The impact of imperfect screening tools on measuring the prevalence of epilepsy and headaches in Burkina Faso.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653519,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 02 19,"Epilepsy and progressively worsening severe chronic headaches (WSCH) are the two most common clinical manifestations of neurocysticercosis, a form of cysticercosis. Most community-based studies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) use a two-step approach (questionnaire and confirmation) to estimate the prevalence of these neurological disorders and neurocysticercosis. Few validate the questionnaire in the field or account for the imperfect nature of the screening questionnaire and the fact that only those who screen positive have the opportunity to be confirmed. This study aims to obtain community-based validity estimates of a screening questionnaire, and to assess the impact of verification bias and misclassification error on prevalence estimates of epilepsy and WSCH.",Impact of two neighbouring ribosomal protein clusters on biogenesis factor binding and assembly of yeast late small ribosomal subunit precursors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653518,PloS one,2019 01 31,"Many of the small ribosomal subunit proteins are required for the stabilisation of late small ribosomal subunit (SSU) precursors and for final SSU rRNA processing in S. cerevisiae. Among them are ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) which form a protein cluster around rpS0 (uS2) at the ""neck"" of the SSU (S0-cluster) and others forming a nearby protein cluster around rpS3 (uS3) at the SSU ""beak"". Here we applied semi-quantitative proteomics together with complementary biochemical approaches to study how incomplete assembly of these two r-protein clusters affects binding and release of SSU maturation factors and assembly of other r-proteins in late SSU precursors in S. cerevisiae. For each of the two clusters specific impairment of the local r-protein assembly state was observed in Rio2 associated SSU precursors. Besides, cluster-specific effects on the association of biogenesis factors were detected. These suggested a role of S0-cluster formation for the efficient release of the two nuclear export factors Rrp12 and Slx9 from SSU precursors and for the correct incorporation of the late acting biogenesis factor Rio2. Based on our and on previous results we propose the existence of at least two different r-protein assembly checkpoints during late SSU maturation in S. cerevisiae. We discuss in the light of recent SSU precursor structure models how r-protein assembly states might be sensed by biogenesis factors at the S0-cluster checkpoint.",Epitranscriptomics: Correlation of N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation and pathway dysregulation in the hippocampus of HIV transgenic rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653517,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, however their roles in mRNA regulation have only recently started to be elucidated. Here we investigated the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in transcripts from the hippocampus of HIV transgenic (Tg) rats. The distribution of m6A peaks within HIV transcripts in HIV Tg rats largely corresponded to the ones observed for HIV transcripts in cell lines and T cells. Host transcripts were found to be differentially m6A methylated in HIV Tg rats. The functional roles of the differentially m6A methylated pathways in HIV Tg rats is consistent with a key role of RNA methylation in the regulation of the brain transcriptome in chronic HIV disease. In particular, host transcripts show significant differential m6A methylation of genes involved in several pathways related to neural function, suggestive of synaptodendritic injury and neurodegeneration, inflammation and immune response, as well as RNA processing and metabolism, such as splicing. Changes in m6A methylation were usually positively correlated with differential expression, while differential m6A methylation of pathways involved in RNA processing were more likely to be negatively correlated with gene expression changes. Thus, sets of differentially m6A methylated, functionally-related transcripts appear to be involved in coordinated transcriptional responses in the context of chronic HIV. Altogether, our results support that m6A methylation represents an additional layer of regulation of HIV and host gene expression in vivo that contributes significantly to the transcriptional effects of chronic HIV."

Past studies have shown that exposure to ultraviolet radiation could explain the difference in MS prevalence across the globe. In this study, we investigate whether the difference in MS prevalence could be explained by European genetic risk factors. We characterized the ancestry of MS-associated alleles using RFMix, a conditional random field parameterized by random forests, to estimate their local ancestry in the largest assembled admixed population to date, with 3,692 African Americans, 4,915 Asian Americans, and 3,777 Hispanics. The majority of MS-associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, including the prominent HLA-DRB1*15:01 risk allele, exhibited cosmopolitan ancestry. Ancestry-specific MS-associated HLA alleles were also identified. Analysis of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 risk allele in African Americans revealed that alleles on the European haplotype conferred three times the disease risk compared to those on the African haplotype. Furthermore, we found evidence that the European and African HLA-DRB1*15:01 alleles exhibit single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences in regions encoding the HLA-DRB1 antigen-binding heterodimer. Additional evidence for increased risk of MS conferred by the European haplotype were found for HLA-B*07:02 and HLA-A*03:01 in African Americans. Most of the 200 non-HLA MS SNPs previously established in European populations were not significantly associated with MS in admixed populations, nor were they ancestrally more European in cases compared to controls. Lastly, a genome-wide search of association between European ancestry and MS revealed a region of interest close to the ZNF596 gene on chromosome 8 in Hispanics; cases had a significantly higher proportion of European ancestry compared to controls. In conclusion, our study established that the genetic ancestry of MS-associated alleles is complex and implicated that difference in MS prevalence could be explained by the ancestry of MS-associated alleles.",Chikungunya as a paradigm for emerging viral diseases: Evaluating disease impact and hurdles to vaccine development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653504,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 02 15,"Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is an emerging infectious disease caused by an alphavirus transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. Because mosquito control programs are not highly efficient for outbreak containment, vaccines are essential to reduce the burden of disease. Although no licensed vaccine against CHIKF is yet available, many highly promising candidates are undergoing preclinical studies, and a few of them have been tested in human trials of phase 1 or 2. Here, we review recent findings regarding the need for a CHIKF vaccine and provide an update on vaccines nearing or having entered clinical trials. We also address needs to tackle bottlenecks to vaccine development-including scientific and financial barriers-and to accelerate the development of vaccines; several actions should be taken: (i) design efficacy trials to be conducted during the course of outbreaks; (ii) evaluate the opportunity for adopting the ""animal rule""for demonstration of efficacy for regulatory purposes; (iii) strengthen the collective commitment of nations, international organizations, potential donors and industry; (iv) stimulate public and/or private partnerships to invest in vaccine development and licensure; and (v) identify potential markets for an effective and safe CHIKF vaccine.",Modeling cell line-specific recruitment of signaling proteins to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653502,PLoS computational biology,2019 02 28,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) typically contain multiple autophosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domains. Once activated, these autophosphorylation sites can recruit downstream signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine-containing short linear motifs (SLiMs). These domains and SLiMs have polyspecific or promiscuous binding activities. Thus, multiple signaling proteins may compete for binding to a common SLiM and vice versa. To investigate the effects of competition on RTK signaling, we used a rule-based modeling approach to develop and analyze models for ligand-induced recruitment of SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins to autophosphorylation sites in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R). Models were parameterized using published datasets reporting protein copy numbers and site-specific binding affinities. Simulations were facilitated by a novel application of model restructuration, to reduce redundancy in rule-derived equations. We compare predictions obtained via numerical simulation of the model to those obtained through simple prediction methods, such as through an analytical approximation, or ranking by copy number and/or KD value, and find that the simple methods are unable to recapitulate the predictions of numerical simulations. We created 45 cell line-specific models that demonstrate how early events in IGF1R signaling depend on the protein abundance profile of a cell. Simulations, facilitated by model restructuration, identified pairs of IGF1R binding partners that are recruited in anti-correlated and correlated fashions, despite no inclusion of cooperativity in our models. This work shows that the outcome of competition depends on the physicochemical parameters that characterize pairwise interactions, as well as network properties, including network connectivity and the relative abundances of competitors.",Single-molecule dynamics and genome-wide transcriptomics reveal that NF-kB (p65)-DNA binding times can be decoupled from transcriptional activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653501,PLoS genetics,2019 03 11,"Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by recognizing and binding to specific DNA promoter sequences. In higher eukaryotes, it remains unclear how the duration of TF binding to DNA relates to downstream transcriptional output. Here, we address this question for the transcriptional activator NF-κB (p65), by live-cell single molecule imaging of TF-DNA binding kinetics and genome-wide quantification of p65-mediated transcription. We used mutants of p65, perturbing either the DNA binding domain (DBD) or the protein-protein transactivation domain (TAD). We found that p65-DNA binding time was predominantly determined by its DBD and directly correlated with its transcriptional output as long as the TAD is intact. Surprisingly, mutation or deletion of the TAD did not modify p65-DNA binding stability, suggesting that the p65 TAD generally contributes neither to the assembly of an ""enhanceosome,"" nor to the active removal of p65 from putative specific binding sites. However, TAD removal did reduce p65-mediated transcriptional activation, indicating that protein-protein interactions act to translate the long-lived p65-DNA binding into productive transcription.",An interaction-based model for neuropsychiatric features of copy-number variants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653500,PLoS genetics,2019 03 11,"Variably expressive copy-number variants (CNVs) are characterized by extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

Here, we posit using multiple lines of evidence, including pathogenicity metrics, functional assays of model organisms, and gene expression data, that multiple genes within each CNV region are likely responsible for the observed phenotypes. We propose that candidate genes within each region likely interact with each other through shared pathways to modulate the individual gene phenotypes, emphasizing the genetic complexity of CNV-associated neuropsychiatric features.",Development of a preliminary in vitro drug screening assay based on a newly established culturing system for pre-adult fifth-stage Onchocerca volvulus worms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653499,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 02 19,"The human filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of onchocerciasis (river blindness). It causes blindness in 270,000 individuals with an additional 6.5 million suffering from severe skin pathologies. Current international control programs focus on the reduction of microfilaridermia by annually administering ivermectin for more than 20 years with the ultimate goal of blocking of transmission. The adult worms of O. volvulus can live within nodules for over 15 years and actively release microfilariae for the majority of their lifespan. Therefore, protracted treatment courses of ivermectin are required to block transmission and eventually eliminate the disease. To shorten the time to elimination of this disease, drugs that successfully target macrofilariae (adult parasites) are needed. Unfortunately, there is no small animal model for the infection that could be used for discovery and screening of drugs against adult O. volvulus parasites. Here, we present an in vitro culturing system that supports the growth and development of O. volvulus young adult worms from the third-stage (L3) infective stage.",Organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) is a distinct catecholamines clearance route in adipocytes mediating the beiging of white adipose tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653498,PLoS biology,2019 02 01,"Beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a particularly appealing target for therapeutics in the treatment of metabolic diseases through norepinephrine (NE)-mediated signaling pathways. Although previous studies report NE clearance mechanisms via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues (ATs), the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit the cleaning efficiency. Here, we report that mouse organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3; Slc22a3) is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes, which differs from other known routes such as adjacent neurons or macrophages. We further show that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis on NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Under NE administration, ablation of Oct3 induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared with littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT (ingWAT) in adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice shows much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than in littermate controls, and this response involves enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to significantly higher levels to compensate for the loss of ATP production in adipose-specific Oct3 knockout (KO) mice, indicating the fundamental role of glucose metabolism during beiging. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolishes the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient ingWAT, indicating the NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes in Oct3 KO adipocytes. Of note, reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 are also identified to be associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.",STRFs in primary auditory cortex emerge from masking-based statistics of natural sounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653497,PLoS computational biology,2019 03 04,"We investigate how the neural processing in auditory cortex is shaped by the statistics of natural sounds. Hypothesising that auditory cortex (A1) represents the structural primitives out of which sounds are composed, we employ a statistical model to extract such components. The input to the model are cochleagrams which approximate the non-linear transformations a sound undergoes from the outer ear, through the cochlea to the auditory nerve. Cochleagram components do not superimpose linearly, but rather according to a rule which can be approximated using the max function. This is a consequence of the compression inherent in the cochleagram and the sparsity of natural sounds. Furthermore, cochleagrams do not have negative values. Cochleagrams are therefore not matched well by the assumptions of standard linear approaches such as sparse coding or ICA. We therefore consider a new encoding approach for natural sounds, which combines a model of early auditory processing with maximal causes analysis (MCA), a sparse coding model which captures both the non-linear combination rule and non-negativity of the data. An efficient truncated EM algorithm is used to fit the MCA model to cochleagram data. We characterize the generative fields (GFs) inferred by MCA with respect to in vivo neural responses in A1 by applying reverse correlation to estimate spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) implied by the learned GFs. Despite the GFs being non-negative, the STRF estimates are found to contain both positive and negative subfields, where the negative subfields can be attributed to explaining away effects as captured by the applied inference method. A direct comparison with ferret A1 shows many similar forms, and the spectral and temporal modulation tuning of both ferret and model STRFs show similar ranges over the population. In summary, our model represents an alternative to linear approaches for biological auditory encoding while it captures salient data properties and links inhibitory subfields to explaining away effects.",Avoidance response to CO2 in the lateral horn.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653496,PLoS biology,2019 02 01,"In flies, the olfactory information is carried from the first relay in the brain, the antennal lobe, to the mushroom body (MB) and the lateral horn (LH). Olfactory associations are formed in the MB. The LH was ascribed a role in innate responses based on the stereotyped connectivity with the antennal lobe, stereotyped physiological responses to odors, and MB silencing experiments. Direct evidence for the functional role of the LH is still missing. Here, we investigate the behavioral role of the LH neurons (LHNs) directly, using the CO2 response as a paradigm. Our results show the involvement of the LH in innate responses. Specifically, we demonstrate that activity in two sets of neurons is required for the full behavioral response to CO2. Tests of the behavioral response to other odors indicate the neurons are selective to CO2 response. Using calcium imaging, we observe that the two sets of neurons respond to CO2 in a different manner. Using independent manipulation and recording of the two sets of neurons, we find that the one that projects to the superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) also outputs to the local neurons within the LH. The design of simultaneous output at the LH and the SIP, an output of the MB, allows for coordination between innate and learned responses.",Thermodynamic model of gene regulation for the Or59b olfactory receptor in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653495,PLoS computational biology,2019 02 28,"Complex eukaryotic promoters normally contain multiple cis-regulatory sequences for different transcription factors (TFs). The binding patterns of the TFs to these sites, as well as the way the TFs interact with each other and with the RNA polymerase (RNAp), lead to combinatorial problems rarely understood in detail, especially under varying epigenetic conditions. The aim of this paper is to build a model describing how the main regulatory cluster of the olfactory receptor Or59b drives transcription of this gene in Drosophila. The cluster-driven expression of this gene is represented as the equilibrium probability of RNAp being bound to the promoter region, using a statistical thermodynamic approach. The RNAp equilibrium probability is computed in terms of the occupancy probabilities of the single TFs of the cluster to the corresponding binding sites, and of the interaction rules among TFs and RNAp, using experimental data of Or59b expression to tune the model parameters. The model reproduces correctly the changes in RNAp binding probability induced by various mutation of specific sites and epigenetic modifications. Some of its predictions have also been validated in novel experiments."

Women are more often on sick-leave for pain than men. Such gender differences have been explained through biological factors, different demands for on the job market, and home conditions. Fewer studies have focused on how gender stereotypes may bias the medical assessment of pain patients. The aim of the present research was to investigate if a gender bias in medical students' evaluations of chronic pain patients can contribute to explaining the gender differences in sick-leave due to pain. Specifically, we investigated whether medical students' estimates of a patient's accuracy of their own work ability and amount of domestic work differed between female and male patients, and how such estimates influenced the medical students' judgments of the patient's work ability. Methods Medical students (n=137; 60 women; 74 men; three unspecified) read a vignette describing a patient with pain and filled out a questionnaire. The vignette was identical and gender neutral, except for the name of the patient signaling gender. A between-subjects experimental design was used in which participants were randomly assigned to an experimental condition. Participants then judged the patient's work ability, the accuracy of the patient's self-assessed work ability, and the amount of domestic work they believed was performed by the patient. All ratings were made on seven-point items. Results The results showed that there was no main effect of gender on perceived future work ability of the patient, F (1,131)=0.867, p=0.353. However, male patients were considered to be more accurate in their self-assessed work ability than female patients F (1,131)=5.925 p=0.016 (Mfemale=4.87, SDfemale=1.22, and Mmale=5.33, SDmale=1.02). Moreover, female patients were thought to perform more domestic work, F (1,131)=25.56, p<0.001 (Mfemale=4.14, SDfemale=1.41, and Mmale=3.07, SDmale=1.16). Finally, perceived amount of domestic work moderated the effects of perceived future work ability for female but not for male patients, B=0.42, p=0.005. Hence, there was a positive effect of amount of domestic work performed on work ability judgments for women, such that the more domestic work they were assumed to perform, the more they were perceived to be able to work. Conclusions Gender stereotypes influenced assessments of future work ability in pain patients, mainly because women were assumed to perform more domestic work which had a positive effect on perceived work ability. Because domestic work should have a negative effect on recovery, expectations from the physician that domestic work is expected by female patients may in fact have the opposite effect prolonging sick-leave. Moreover, the students trusted the male patients' ability to assess their own work capacity more than women's. Implications It is important that medical students receive education about gender biases and how they may influence medical assessment during their training. Such education may alleviate the influence of gender stereotypes.",MLML2R: an R package for maximum likelihood estimation of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation proportions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653470,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Accurately measuring epigenetic marks such as 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) at the single-nucleotide level, requires combining data from DNA processing methods including traditional (BS), oxidative (oxBS) or Tet-Assisted (TAB) bisulfite conversion. We introduce the R package MLML2R, which provides maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of 5-mC and 5-hmC proportions. While all other available R packages provide 5-mC and 5-hmC MLEs only for the oxBS+BS combination, MLML2R also provides MLE for TAB combinations. For combinations of any two of the methods, we derived the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) exact constrained MLE in analytical form. For the three methods combination, we implemented both the iterative method by Qu et al. [Qu, J., M. Zhou, Q. Song, E. E. Hong and A. D. Smith (2013): ""Mlml: consistent simultaneous estimates of dna methylation and hydroxymethylation,"" Bioinformatics, 29, 2645-2646.], and also a novel non iterative approximation using Lagrange multipliers. The newly proposed non iterative solutions greatly decrease computational time, common bottlenecks when processing high-throughput data. The MLML2R package is flexible as it takes as input both, preprocessed intensities from Infinium Methylation arrays and counts from Next Generation Sequencing technologies.

Methods This retrospective study used a cohort from the National Perinatal Information System of Slovenia (NPIS). Prospectively collected information from pregnancies delivered in all of Slovenia's 14 maternal hospitals between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2012 was included. Coefficients were derived using a backward stepwise multiple regression technique. Results A total of 126,627 consecutive deliveries with complete data were included in the multivariable analysis. Maternal height, weight in early pregnancy and parity as well as the baby's sex were identified as physiological variables, with coefficients comparable to findings in other countries. The expected 280-day birthweight, free from pathological influences, of a standard size mother (height 163 cm, weight 64 kg) in her first pregnancy was 3451.3 g. Pathological influences on birthweight within this population included low and high maternal age, low and high body mass index (BMI), smoking, pre-existing and gestational diabetes and pre-existing and gestational hypertension. Conclusion The analysis confirmed the main physiological variables that affect birthweight in studies from other countries, and was able to quantify additional pathological factors of maternal age and gestational diabetes. Development of a country-specific customised birthweight standard will aid clinicians in Slovenia with the distinction between normal and abnormal small-for-gestational age (SGA) fetuses, thus avoiding unnecessary interventions and improving identification of at risk pregnancies, and long-term outcomes for infants.",Teaching Basic Nursing Care: Nurse Preceptors' Perceptions about Changing the Teaching Context from the Clinical Setting to a School Simulation Lab.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653468,International journal of nursing education scholarship,2019 01 17,"Research demonstrates that basic nursing care receives less attention in clinical settings and has become visually less prominent in nursing education curriculums.

Data were collected through focus group interviews and participant observation and analyzed by using qualitative content analysis. Three main categories emerged: (i) Perceived advantages and disadvantages, (ii) Positive attitudes - remembering being a student, and (iii) Knowing what to do and showing how to do it.

The recent advances in bioinformatics, databases and statistics, have provided a unique perception of metabolites interaction and the dynamics of metabolic pathways at a system level. In this context, several studies have applied metabolomics in physiology- and disease-related works. The application of metabolomics includes, physiological and metabolic evaluation/monitoring, individual response to different exercise, nutritional interventions, pathological processes, responses to pharmacological interventions, biomarker discovery and monitoring for distinct aspects, such as: physiological capacity, fatigue/recovery and aging among other applications. For metabolomic analyses, despite huge improvements in the field, several complex methodological steps must be taken into consideration.

The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Hence, we used human conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC) overexpressing OAT1 or OAT3 to gain insight into these mechanisms. In ciPTEC-OAT1 and -OAT3, extracellular lactate levels were decreased (by 77% and 71%, respectively), while intracellular ATP levels remained unchanged, suggesting a shift towards an oxidative phenotype upon OAT1 or OAT3 overexpression. This was confirmed by increased respiration of ciPTEC-OAT1 and -OAT3 (1.4-fold), a decreased sensitivity to respiratory inhibition, and characterized by a higher demand on mitochondrial oxidative capacity. In-depth profiling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites revealed reduced levels of intermediates converging into α-ketoglutarate in ciPTEC-OAT1 and -OAT3, which via 2-hydroxyglutarate metabolism explains the increased respiration. These interactions with TCA cycle metabolites were in agreement with metabolomic network modeling studies published earlier. Further studies using OAT or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitors confirmed our idea that OATs are responsible for increased use and synthesis of α-ketoglutarate. In conclusion, our results indicate an increased α-ketoglutarate efflux by OAT1 and OAT3, resulting in a metabolic shift towards an oxidative phenotype.",The conserved theme of ribosome hibernation: from bacteria to chloroplasts of plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653464,Biological chemistry,2019 06 12,"Cells are highly adaptive systems that respond and adapt to changing environmental conditions such as temperature fluctuations or altered nutrient availability. Such acclimation processes involve reprogramming of the cellular gene expression profile, tuning of protein synthesis, remodeling of metabolic pathways and morphological changes of the cell shape. Nutrient starvation can lead to limited energy supply and consequently, remodeling of protein synthesis is one of the key steps of regulation since the translation of the genetic code into functional polypeptides may consume up to 40% of a cell's energy during proliferation. In eukaryotic cells, downregulation of protein synthesis during stress is mainly mediated by modification of the translation initiation factors. Prokaryotic cells suppress protein synthesis by the active formation of dimeric so-called 'hibernating' 100S ribosome complexes. Such a transition involves a number of proteins which are found in various forms in prokaryotes but also in chloroplasts of plants. Here, we review the current understanding of these hibernation factors and elaborate conserved principles which are shared between species.",Chemical modification of neuropeptide Y for human Y1 receptor targeting in health and disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653463,Biological chemistry,2019 02 13,"As a very abundant neuropeptide in the brain and widely distributed peptide hormone in the periphery, neuropeptide Y (NPY) appears to be a multisignaling key peptide. Together with peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide and the four human G protein-coupled receptor subtypes hY1R, hY2R, hY4R and hY5R it forms the NPY/hYR multiligand/multireceptor system, which is involved in essential physiological processes as well as in human diseases. In particular, NPY-induced hY1R signaling plays a central role in the regulation of food intake and stress response as well as in obesity, mood disorders and cancer. Thus, several hY1R-preferring NPY analogs have been developed as versatile tools to unravel the complex NPY/hY1R signaling in health and disease. Further, these peptides provide basic lead structures for the development of innovative drugs. Here, the current research is summarized focusing on the development of differently sized hY1R-preferring NPY analogs as well as their advances with respect to hY1R profiling, potential therapeutic applications and targeted cancer imaging and therapy. Finally, major limitations and innovative strategies for next generation hY1R-preferring NPY analogs are addressed.",Changqin NO. 1 inhibits neuronal apoptosis via suppressing GAS5 expression in a traumatic brain injury mice model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653462,Biological chemistry,2019 05 10,"The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism of the traditional Chinese medicine Changqin NO. 1 on the amelioration of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Adult male C57BL/6J mice and newborn mice were used to generate a mouse TBI model and harvest primary neurons, respectively. The localizations of specific neural markers neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1), growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and microtubule-associated protein Tau (Tau) were examined in brain tissues by immunohistochemistry. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling apoptotic cell detection in tissue sections and the CCK-8 cell viability assay were performed to examine neuronal apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were also carried out in this study. The association between long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) growth-arrest specific 5 (GAS5), miR-335 and RAS p21 GTPase activating protein 1 (Rasa1) was disclosed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Changqin NO. 1 inhibited TBI-induced neuronal apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. GAS5 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-335 to upregulate Rasa1 expression in mouse neuronal cells. Further investigations demonstrated that GAS5 promoted neuronal apoptosis following TBI via the miR-335/Rasa1 axis. In vivo experiments indicated that Changqin NO. 1 exerted neuroprotection during TBI via the GAS5/miR-335/Rasa1 axis. Changqin NO. 1 promoted neuroprotective effects by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis via the GAS5/miR-335/Rasa1 axis in TBI.",Adverse reproductive outcomes associated with fetal alcohol exposure: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653461,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 16,"Fetal alcohol exposure results in well-characterised neurobehavioural deficits in offspring, which form the basis for diagnosing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. However, there is increasing interest in the full range of health complications that can arise in children and adults with this disorder. We used a systematic review approach to locate all clinical and preclinical studies across a broad range of health outcomes in offspring exposed to prenatal alcohol. Our search encompassed four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) and titles/abstracts from retrieved studies were screened against strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review specifically evaluated studies reporting on reproductive outcomes in both males and females. A total of 23 studies were included, 5 clinical and 18 preclinical. Although there was a wide range in the quality of reporting across both clinical and preclinical studies, and variable results, trends emerged amongst the reproductive measures that were investigated. In females, most studies focussed on age at first menarche/puberty onset, with evidence for a significant delay in alcohol-exposed offspring. In males, offspring exposed to prenatal alcohol had altered testosterone levels, reduced testes and accessory gland weights and reduced sperm concentration and semen volume. However, further studies are required due to the paucity of clinical studies, the narrow scope of female reproductive outcomes examined and inconsistencies in outcomes across preclinical studies. We recommend that adolescents and individuals of reproductive age diagnosed with f-etal alcohol spectrum disorder be assessed for reproductive dysfunction to allow appropriate management of their reproductive health and fertility."

Clinical evidence establishes an endothelial protective effect of metformin, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether metformin exerts its protective role against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial impairment through the autophagy machinery. db/db mice were treated with intravitreal metformin injections. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured either in normal glucose (NG, 5.5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 33 mM) medium in the presence or absence of metformin for 72 h. We observed an obvious inhibition of hyperglycemia-triggered autophagosome synthesis in both the diabetic retinal vasculature and cultured HUVECs by metformin, along with restoration of hyperglycemia-impaired Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity. Specifically, deletion of ATG7 in retinal vascular ECs of db/db mice and cultured HUVECs indicated a detrimental role of autophagy in hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. Pretreatment with GANT61, a Hh pathway inhibitor, abolished the metformin-mediated downregulation of autophagy and endothelial protective action. Furthermore, GLI-family (transcription factors of the Hh pathway) knockdown in HUVECs and retinal vasculature revealed that downregulation of hyperglycemia-activated autophagy by the metformin-mediated Hh pathway activation was GLI1 dependent. Mechanistically, GLI1 knockdown-triggered autophagy was related to upregulation of BNIP3, which subsequently disrupted the association of BECN1/Beclin 1 and BCL2. The role of BNIP3 in BECN1 dissociation from BCL2 was further confirmed by BNIP3 overexpression or BNIP3 RNAi. Taken together, the endothelial protective effect of metformin under hyperglycemia conditions could be partly attributed to its role in downregulating autophagy via Hh pathway activation.

Whereas several programs leading to CAF activation have been elucidated, little is known about the impact of the microenvironment on the turnover of key CAF regulators. RBPJ/CSL is a transcriptional repressor that mediates NOTCH signaling and its down-modulation activates the gene expression program(s) leading to stromal senescence and CAF activation. We overview our evidence that conditions increasing macroautophagy/autophagy, as often found in the stroma of tumors, cause the down-modulation of the RBPJ protein. This event requires the autophagic machinery and is functionally relevant because it is associated with an increase of CAF effector gene expression. The mechanism involves the direct association with the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62, which is required for RBPJ down-modulation. As a reflection of increased autophagy in the stroma, both the RBPJ and SQSTM1 proteins are down-modulated in Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) patient-derived CAFs. Increasing RBPJ cellular levels stabilizes SQSTM1 and down-modulates the autophagic process. Our findings identify an autophagy-initiated mechanism for RBPJ down-modulation leading to increased CAF gene expression.",Immunity and Inflammation in Atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653442,Circulation research,2019 01 26,"There is now overwhelming experimental and clinical evidence that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease.

Statins are a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol. However, in spite of their wide-spread use, discontinuation and nonadherence remains a major gap in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The major reason for statin discontinuation is because of the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, but a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist. Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects as well as provide alternative treatment strategies. In this article, we review the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity and focus on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.",TRIM59 deficiency curtails breast cancer metastasis through SQSTM1-selective autophagic degradation of PDCD10.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653426,Autophagy,2019 06 10,"Receptor-driven selective macroautophagy/autophagy delivers ubiquitinated targets for autophagosomal clearance to maintain metabolic homeostasis and orchestrate reparative inflammatory responses.

With new regional and global indexes available we sought to determine the effect of 24-wk endurance versus resistance training on LV mechanics. Twenty-three male subjects were randomly allocated to a 24-wk endurance or resistance training program. Pre- and posttraining two-dimensional echocardiographic images were acquired. Global LV mechanics [strain (ε)] were recorded in longitudinal, circumferential, and radial planes. Rotation was assessed at apical and basal levels. In addition, longitudinal ε-volume loops, across the cardiac cycle, were constructed from simultaneous LV ε (longitudinal and transverse strain) and volume measurements across the cardiac cycle as a novel measure of LV mechanics. Marginal differences in ε and rotation data were found between groups. After training, we found no change in global peak ε data. Peak basal rotation significantly increased after training, with changes in the endurance group (-2.2 ± 1.9° to -4.5 ± 3.3°) and the resistance group (-2.9 ± 3.0° to -3.4 ± 2.9°). LV ε-volume loops revealed a modest rightward shift in both groups. Although most global and regional indexes of LV mechanics were not significantly altered, 24 wk of intense supervised exercise training increased basal rotation. Further studies that assess LV mechanics in larger cohorts of subjects and those with cardiovascular disease and risk factors may reveal important training impacts. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study builds on previous work by our group and presents a comprehensive assessment of cardiac mechanics after dichotomous exercise training programs. We highlight novel findings in addition to the inclusion of strain-volume loops, which shed light on subtle differences in longitudinal and transverse contribution to volume change throughout the cardiac cycle. Our findings suggest that training has an impact on basal rotation and possibly strain-volume loops.",Advanced glycation end-product cross-linking inhibits biomechanical plasticity and characteristic failure morphology of native tendon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653412,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 05 01,"Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are formed in vivo from the nonenzymatic reaction between sugars and proteins. AGEs accumulate in long-lived tissues like tendons, cross-linking neighboring collagen molecules, and are in part complicit in connective tissue pathologies experienced in aging and with diabetes. We have previously described discrete plasticity: a characteristic form of nanoscale collagen fibril damage consisting of serial fibril kinking and collagen denaturation that occurs in some mechanically overloaded tendons. We suspect that this failure mechanism may be an adaptive trait of collagen fibrils and have published evidence that inflammatory cells may be able to recognize and digest the denatured collagen produced by overload. In this study, we treated bovine tail tendons with ribose to simulate long-term AGE cross-linking in vitro. We hypothesized that a high degree of cross-linking would inhibit the intermolecular sliding thought to be necessary for discrete plasticity to occur. Tendons were mechanically overloaded, and properties were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and scanning election microscopy. Ribose cross-linking treatment altered the mechanical response of tendons after the yield point, significantly decreasing postyield extensibility and strain energy capacity before rupture. Coincident with altered mechanics, ribose cross-linking completely inhibited the discrete plasticity failure mechanism of tendon. Our results suggest that discrete plasticity, which may be an important physiological mechanism, becomes pathologically disabled by the formation of AGE cross-links in aging and diabetes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We have previously shown that mechanically overloaded collagen fibrils in mammalian tendons accrue nanoscaled damage. This includes development of a characteristic kinking morphology within a shell of denatured collagen: discrete plasticity. Here, using a ribose-incubation model, we show that advanced glycation end-product cross-linking associated with aging and diabetes completely inhibits this mechanism. Since discrete plasticity appears to cue cellular remodeling, this result has important implications for diabetic tendinopathy.",Do People Know What They're Like in the Moment?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653411,Psychological science,2019 03 13,"Knowing yourself requires knowing not only what you are like in general (trait self-knowledge) but also how your personality fluctuates from moment to moment (state self-knowledge). We examined this latter form of self-knowledge. Participants (248 people; 2,938 observations) wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an unobtrusive audio recorder, and completed experience-sampling self-reports of their personality states four times each day for 1 week. We estimated state self-knowledge by comparing self-reported personality states with consensual observer ratings of personality states coded from the EAR files, which formed the criterion for what participants were ""actually"" like in the moment. People had self-insight into their momentary extraversion, conscientiousness, and likely neuroticism, suggesting that people can accurately detect fluctuations in some aspects of their personality. However, the evidence for self-insight was weaker for agreeableness. This apparent self-ignorance may be partly responsible for interpersonal problems and for blind spots in trait self-knowledge.",Too sick or not too sick?

Of all workers who did not show sickness presenteeism themselves, another 6 out of 10 saw or heard about sickness presenteeism in their own organization. Women were more likely to report sickness presenteeism than men and junior workers were more prone to sickness presenteeism than senior workers. Education did not explain the choice for sickness presenteeism. Satisfaction with the supervisor had a direct negative effect on sickness presenteeism. Finally, indirect effects were found between satisfaction with the supervisor and sickness presenteeism via the prevalence of stress. While previous studies showed that good supervisor support can make sick workers more productive when they show up at work, this study shows that good supervisor support makes sick workers stay at home.","The Go-VAR (Veterans Active Recovery): An Adjunctive, Exercise-Based Intervention for Veterans Recovering from Substance Use Disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653409,Journal of psychoactive drugs,2019 02 22,"Substance use disorders (SUD) are prevalent among veterans, and the relapse rate is estimated at ≥60% within one year of treatment.

The transcription activity of TFEB is tightly controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Phosphorylated S211 (p-S211) of TFEB can be recognized by YWHA/14-3-3 proteins for TFEB cytoplasmic localization. Here, we characterized the interactions between phosphorylated TFEB and YWHA/14-3-3 proteins and determined the structures of YWHA/14-3-3 proteins in complex with a TFEB p-S211-peptide. Although the critical arginine for YWHA/14-3-3 recognition is missing in the N terminus of the TFEB p-S211-peptide, the C-terminal additional hydrophobic residues of the peptide unexpectedly occupy nearly half of the target-binding groove of YWHA/14-3-3 proteins, which compensates for the N-terminal defect and is distinct from the canonical YWHA/14-3-3-binding mode. Mutations of essential residues in the interaction interface between TFEB and YWHA/14-3-3 proteins disrupted their interactions and severely impaired the cytoplasmic localization of TFEB, which altered the expression of TFEB target genes and affected autophagy. Thus, YWHA/14-3-3 proteins recognize phosphorylated TFEB by a noncanonical mode for controlling TFEB cytoplasmic localization and its activity.

However, the direct roles of the various PRMTs during skeletal muscle remodeling remain unclear. Using skeletal muscle-specific prmt1 knockout mice, we examined the function and downstream targets of PRMT1 in muscle homeostasis. We found that muscle-specific PRMT1 deficiency led to muscle atrophy. PRMT1-deficient muscles exhibited enhanced expression of a macroautophagic/autophagic marker LC3-II, FOXO3 and muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, TRIM63/MURF-1 and FBXO32, likely contributing to muscle atrophy. The mechanistic study reveals that PRMT1 regulates FOXO3 through PRMT6 modulation. In the absence of PRMT1, increased PRMT6 specifically methylates FOXO3 at arginine 188 and 249, leading to its activation. Finally, we demonstrate that PRMT1 deficiency triggers FOXO3 hyperactivation, which is abrogated by PRMT6 depletion. Taken together, PRMT1 is a key regulator for the PRMT6-FOXO3 axis in the control of autophagy and protein degradation underlying muscle maintenance.

The initiative entailed two cycles of learning sessions followed by implementation of ACP practice improvement projects in the facilities using a PDSA approach by participating clinicians (e.g., physicians, social workers, nurses). Clinicians reported significantly increased confidence in many dimensions of ACP activities. Rates of hospital use and resident preference for home-based care did not change significantly. The initiative established routine data collection of outcomes to inform practice change, and successfully engaged physicians and non-physician clinicians to work together to improve ACP practices. Results suggest recurrent PDSA cycles that engage a 'critical mass' of clinicians may be warranted to reinforce the standardization of ACP in practice."

We have determined the molecular mechanism of Nt-R recognition using a combination of biochemical and NMR approaches and obtained the crystal structure of SQSTM1/p62ZZ in complex with Nt-R. We found that binding of SQSTM1/p62ZZ to Nt-R induces SQSTM1/p62 puncta formation and macroautophagy/autophagy and identified a regulatory linker (RL) region of SQSTM1/p62 that associates with SQSTM1/p62ZZ in vitro.

Background:
 Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are often impacted by distress due to disease and treatment. Despite these concerns, prior research has found that AYAs do not utilize support resources, do not find these resources adequate, and or do not have adequate access to services. 
Objective:
 The objective of this project was to understand and identify AYA patient concerns and experiences throughout cancer treatment, what resources were utilized, how they were identified, and how supportive care resources for AYA cancer patients can be improved. 
Methods:
 Twenty-eight AYA cancer patients and survivors were interviewed on their experiences and utilization of supportive resources throughout cancer treatment. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis and organized through a priori framework examining specific domains of experience and resources utilized. 
Results:
 The most frequently discussed topic in qualitative interviews was the benefit of the health care team. Other frequently identified resources were generalized internet searches and webpages. Suggested unmet resource needs included supportive resources for family members and caregivers throughout the time of treatment. 
Conclusions:
 AYAs experience stress throughout treatment for cancer attributed to physical, practical, and psychosocial causes. Health care workers play a vital role in serving as an informative and supportive resource for their AYA patients. As such, health care workers and other supportive resources may alleviate these concerns, but these resources are still underexplored.",Serum Testosterone Level Within Normal Range Is Positively Associated with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Premenopausal but Not Postmenopausal Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653387,Journal of women's health (2002),2019 01 17,"A positive relationship between testosterone level and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in women has been reported, but findings concerning the association are conflicting and inconclusive.",Activities and participation after stroke: validity and reliability of the Turkish version of IMPACT-S questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653386,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 17,"This study aims to translate the screener part of the The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Measure of Participation and ACTivities Questionnaire (IMPACT-S) into Turkish and to test its reliability and validity in Turkish patients with stroke.",Reliability and validity and of the Greek shoulder pain and disability index in patients with shoulder pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653385,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 17,"The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index is one of the most common questionnaire to evaluate the impact of shoulder disorders on function.

Presentation, management and prognostic factors are poorly characterised. Methods: Retrospective single centre study from 2000 to 2016. Results: 50 cases were identified (median age 29 years; range 16-76). Symptoms at presentation were neurological deficit (n = 21), headache (n = 18) and seizures (n = 6). Five were incidental findings. Five patients had hydrocephalus at presentation and required emergent management, two by endoscopic third ventriculostomy and three by external ventricular drain. Symptoms were present for a median of 16 weeks (range 1 week to 34 years). Surgery consisted of gross total resection (n = 23), subtotal resection (n = 21) or biopsy (n = 6). Progression occurred in 20 patients at a median time of 7 years following surgery and was asymptomatic in just over half of these cases. A greater degree of resection (complete vs. subtotal) was associated with longer time to progression (Kaplan-Meier analysis, log rank test = 3.58, p = 0.059). At their first progression 12 patients underwent re-resective surgery and the remainder received radiotherapy. The median 5-year survival was 80%. Conclusions: In adult patients with a pilocytic astrocytoma, a macroscopic resection should be the aim at the first resective operation. Emergency management of hydrocephalus may be required in the first instance."

Preclinical and clinical studies based on the administration of ASCs support their efficacy in bone regeneration, joint repair, tendon injury and skeletal muscle alterations. Many of these novel treatments may improve patients' quality of life and prognosis. However, several concerns about the use of stem cells remain unsolved, particularly regarding their safety and side effects. The present work aims to review the nature, clinical trials and patents involving the use of ASCs in musculoskeletal disorders. Area covered: In this article, we describe ASCs' isolation, culture and differentiation in vivo and in vitro, advances on ASCs' applications in bone, cartilage, muscle and tendon repair, and patents involving the use of ASCs. Expert opinion: The use of ASCs in musculoskeletal disorders presents significant therapeutic advantages, including limited autoimmune response, potential cell expansion ex vivo, high plasticity to differentiate into several mesodermal cell lineages, and additional effects of therapeutic interest such as secretion of neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory properties.

Laboratory testing and treatment for anemia, presumptive immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and possible hemostatic disorder was initiated. A persistent anemia, progressive thrombocytopenia, and the development of a firm swelling and neurologic impairment in the limb raised concerns for compartment syndrome (CS). A musculoskeletal ultrasound revealed a large aneurysm in the caudal thigh surrounded by abnormal muscle tissue. The patient underwent amputation of the limb and recovered without further complication. Pathology findings were consistent with the development of femoral CS secondary to a ruptured peripheral arterial aneurysm or a pseudoaneurysm. A consumptive thrombocytopenia and regenerative anemia were attributed to periodic or progressive thrombosis of the vessel and regional hemorrhage. Postoperative CS can develop in combination with peripheral arterial aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, and screening for vascular abnormalities as well as CS should be considered in complicated recovery from orthopedic surgery with compatible clinical signs including progressive soft tissue swelling, persistent anemia, and thrombocytopenia."

Coriobacteriaceae were found to gradually increase over gestational time irrespective of breed, which was further validated in an independent cohort of sows, indicating that Coriobacteriaceae are likely associated with the progression of pregnancy. Escherichia increased as well. Relative to empty and gestation, lactation was associated with an increase in SCFA producers and a concomitant augmentation in SCFA production in both breeds. A comparison between the 2 breeds revealed that Ruminococcaceae were more abundant in RSs than in LSs, consistent with the strong ability of Rongchang pigs to digest highly fibrous feedstuffs.

Efforts to increase PrEP uptake among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), in particular, are ongoing in research and practice settings, but few tools exist to support interventions. We aimed to develop and validate tools to support motivational interviewing interventions for PrEP. In 2017, a national sample of HIV-negative GBM of relatively high socioeconomic status (n = 786) was asked about sexual behaviors that encompass Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for PrEP use, a 35-item decisional-balance scale (i.e., PrEP-DB) assessing benefits and consequences of PrEP use, and questions assessing location on the motivational PrEP cascade and derivative-the PrEP contemplation ladder. Principal axis factoring with oblique promax rotation was used for PrEP-DB construct identification and item reduction. The final 20-item PrEP-DB performed well; eigenvalues indicating a 4-factor solution provided an adequate fit to the data. Factors included the following: health benefits (α = 0.91), health consequences (α = 0.82), social benefits (α = 0.72), and social consequences (α = 0.86). Ladder scores increased across the cascade (ρ = 0.89, p < 0.001), and health benefits (β = 0.50, p < 0.001) and health consequences (β = -0.37, p < 0.001) were more strongly associated with ladder location than social benefits (β = 0.05, p > 0.05) and social consequences (β = -0.05, p > 0.05) in the fully adjusted regression model.

However, the corresponding increase in genetic information necessitates adoption of a new approach for network estimation. Data dimensions increase with the progress in genome sequencing technology, thereby making it difficult to estimate gene networks by causing multicollinearity. Furthermore, such a problem also occurs when hub nodes exist, where gene networks are known to have regulator genes that can be interpreted as hub nodes. This study aims at developing methods that demonstrate good performance when handling high-dimensional data with hub nodes. We propose regression-based approaches as feasible solutions in this article. Elastic-net and adaptive elastic-net penalty regressions were applied to compensate for the disadvantages of existing regression-based approaches employing LASSO or adaptive LASSO. Experiments were performed to compare the proposed regression-based approaches with other conventional methods. We confirmed the superior performance of the regression-based approaches and applied it to actual genetic data to verify the suitability to estimate gene networks. As results, robustness of the proposed methods was demonstrated with respect to high-dimensional gene expression data."

Our current understanding of the biological processes involved in RILD which includes DNA damage, inflammation, senescence and fibrosis, is based on clinical observations and experimental studies in mouse models using conventional radiation exposures. Whilst these studies have provided vital information on the pulmonary radiation response, the current implementation of small animal irradiators is enabling refinements in the precision and accuracy of dose delivery to mice which can be applied to studies of RILD. This review presents the current landscape of preclinical studies in RILD using small animal irradiators and highlights the challenges and opportunities for the further development of this emerging technology in the study of normal tissue damage in the lung.","The Dallol Geothermal Area, Northern Afar (Ethiopia)-An Exceptional Planetary Field Analog on Earth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653331,Astrobiology,2019 04 14,"The Dallol volcano and its associated hydrothermal field are located in a remote area of the northern Danakil Depression in Ethiopia, a region only recently appraised after decades of inaccessibility due to severe political instability and the absence of infrastructure. The region is notable for hosting environments at the very edge of natural physical-chemical extremities. It is surrounded by a wide, hyperarid salt plain and is one of the hottest (average annual temperatureDallol: 36-38°C) and most acidic natural systems (pHDallol ≈0) on Earth. Spectacular geomorphologies and mineral deposits produced by supersaturated hydrothermal waters and brines are the result of complex interactions between active and inactive hydrothermal alteration of the bedrock, sulfuric hot springs and pools, fumaroles and geysers, and recrystallization processes driven by hydrothermal waters, degassing, and rapid evaporation. The study of planetary field analog environments plays a crucial role in characterizing the physical and chemical boundaries within which life can exist on Earth and other planets. It is essential for the definition and assessment of the conditions of habitability on other planets, including the possibility for biosignature preservation and in situ testing of technologies for life detection. The Dallol area represents an excellent Mars analog environment given that the active volcanic environment, the associated diffuse hydrothermalism and hydrothermal alteration, and the vast acidic sulfate deposits are reminiscent of past hydrothermal activity on Mars. The work presented in this paper is an overview of the Dallol volcanic area and its hydrothermal field that integrates previous literature with observations and results obtained from field surveys and monitoring coupled with sample characterization. In so doing, we highlight its exceptional potential as a planetary field analog as well as a site for future astrobiological and exploration programs.",Carboxylic Anhydride Synthesis from γ-Benzyl-l-glutamate and Dimethyl Carbonate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653330,Organic letters,2019 03 04,"A green, environmentally friendly, and nontoxic method was developed to synthesize carboxylic anhydrides (NCAs) from γ-benzyl-l-glutamate (BLG) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) though two steps: synthesis of N-methoxycarbonyl-γ-benzyl-l-glutamate intermediate (NOM-BLG) and cyclization. The highest yields of NOM-BLG (up to 83.7%) and NCA-BLG (up to 66.7%) were obtained.

Micropatterning methodologies require both a suitable biomimetic support and a printing technology. In this work, we present the micropatterning of living mammalian cells on carboxymethyl dextran (CMD) hydrogel layers using the FluidFM BOT technology. In contrast to the ultrathin (few nanometers thick in the dry state) CMD films generally used in label-free biosensor applications, we developed CMD layers with thicknesses of several tens of nanometers in order to provide support for the controlled adhesion of living cells. The fabrication method and detailed characterization of the CMD layers are also described. The antifouling ability of the CMD surfaces is demonstrated by in situ optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy measurements using serum modeling proteins with different electrostatic properties and molecular weights. Cell micropatterning on the CMD surface was obtained by printing cell adhesion mediating cRGDfK peptide molecules (cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys)) directly from aqueous solution using microchanneled cantilevers with subsequent incubation of the printed surfaces in the living cell culture. Uniquely, we present cell patterns with different geometries (spot, line, and grid arrays) covering both micrometer and millimeter-centimeter scale areas. The adhered patterns were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy and the adhesion process on the patterns was real-time monitored by digital holographic microscopy, enabling to quantify the survival and migration of cells on the printed cRGDfK arrays.",Identification of Common Resonant Lines in the EPR Spectra of Melanins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653327,The journal of physical chemistry.

Among their unique properties, the existence of a persistent paramagnetic signal can be considered one of the most intriguing and controversial features. Additionally, the possible influence of such centers on charge transport accentuates the need for a better understanding of their origin and specific characteristics. In this report, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of melanin samples obtained at different experimental conditions were systematically studied.

Besides being useful drug carriers, microbubbles have demonstrated the ability to enhance cell and tissue permeability and, as a consequence, drug uptake herein. Notwithstanding the large amount of evidence for their therapeutic efficacy, open issues remain. Because of the vast number of ultrasound- and microbubble-related parameters that can be altered and the variability in different models, the translation from basic research to (pre)clinical studies has been hindered. This review aims at connecting the knowledge gained from fundamental microbubble studies to the therapeutic efficacy seen in in vitro and in vivo studies, with an emphasis on a better understanding of the response of a microbubble upon exposure to ultrasound and its interaction with cells and tissues. More specifically, we address the acoustic settings and microbubble-related parameters (i.e., bubble size and physicochemistry of the bubble shell) that play a key role in microbubble-cell interactions and in the associated therapeutic outcome. Additionally, new techniques that may provide additional control over the treatment, such as monodisperse microbubble formulations, tunable ultrasound scanners, and cavitation detection techniques, are discussed. An in-depth understanding of the aspects presented in this work could eventually lead the way to more efficient and tailored microbubble-assisted ultrasound therapy in the future.","Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure 1,2,3-Trisubstituted Cyclopropane Nucleosides Using Pd-Catalyzed Substitution via Directing Group-Mediated C(sp3)-H Activation as a Key Step.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653324,Organic letters,2019 03 04,"A series of enantiomerically pure 1,2,3-trisubstituted cyclopropane nucleosides Ia-Id and IIa-IId of medicinal chemical interest was designed and synthesized.

Superposition of Atomic Potentials: Simple yet Efficient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653322,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 03 12,"Electronic structure calculations, such as in the Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham density functional approach, require an initial guess for the molecular orbitals. The quality of the initial guess has a significant impact on the speed of convergence of the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. Popular choices for the initial guess include the one-electron guess from the core Hamiltonian, the extended Hückel method, and the superposition of atomic densities (SAD). Here, we discuss alternative guesses obtained from the superposition of atomic potentials (SAP), which is easily implementable even in real-space calculations. We also discuss a variant of SAD which produces guess orbitals by purification of the density matrix that could also be used in real-space calculations, as well as a parameter-free variant of the extended Hückel method, which resembles the SAP method and is easy to implement on top of existing SAD infrastructure. The performance of the core Hamiltonian, the SAD, and the SAP guesses as well as the extended Hückel variant is assessed in nonrelativistic calculations on a data set of 259 molecules ranging from the first to the fourth periods by projecting the guess orbitals onto precomputed, converged SCF solutions in single- to triple-ζ basis sets. It is shown that the proposed SAP guess is the best guess on average. The extended Hückel guess offers a good alternative, with less scatter in accuracy.",Hydration Effect on Positron Binding Ability of Proline: Positron Attachment Induces Proton-Transfer To Form Zwitterionic Structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653321,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 19,"The positron binding abilities of proline and its hydrated clusters were theoretically studied using multicomponent molecular orbital (MC_MO) calculations. Low-lying equilibrium structures of the neutral proline·(H2O) n ( n = 0-2) clusters were systematically explored with the aid of global reaction route mapping code. The positron binding energies were then calculated for the equilibrium structures. We found that the zwitterionic forms generally displayed high positron binding energies owing to their highly polar nature. We also found that nonzwitterionic forms can exhibit high positron binding energies if the addition of water significantly increases the total electric dipole moment. These results demonstrate that the most stable positron-bound proline·(H2O) n ( n = 1 and 2) structures are more stable than the most stable neutral structures, which implies that the attachment of a positron to a neutral hydrated proline cluster can induce structural changes if the positron-electron annihilation lifetime is sufficiently long relative to the time scale of nuclear motion. We also examined the influence of positron binding on the energy profiles of the proton transfer reactions from the nonzwitterionic form to the zwitterionic form."

Farmed seafood is a relatively efficient way to produce protein and has already overtaken wild fisheries. The use of protein-rich food crops, such as soy, instead of fishmeal in aquaculture feed diverts these important protein sources away from direct human consumption and creates new environmental challenges. Single cell proteins (SCPs), including bacteria and yeast, have recently emerged as replacements for plant-based proteins in salmon feeds. Attributional life cycle assessment is used to compare salmon feeds based on protein from soy, methanotrophic bacteria, and yeast ingredients. All ingredients are modeled at the industrial production scale and compared based on seven resource use and emissions indicators. Yeast protein concentrate showed drastically lower impacts in all categories compared to soy protein concentrate. Bacteria meal also had lower impacts than soy protein concentrate for five of the seven indicators. When these target meals were incorporated into complete feeds the relative trends remain fairly constant, but benefits of the novel ingredients are dampened by high impacts from the nontarget ingredients. Particularly, primary production requirements (PPR) are about equal and constant across all feeds for both analyses since PPR was driven by fishmeal and oil. The bacteria-based feed has the highest climate change impacts due to the use of methane to feed the bacteria who then release carbon dioxide. Overall, the results of this study suggest that incorporating SCP ingredients into salmon feeds can help reduce the environmental impacts of salmon production. Continued improvements in SCP production would further increase the sustainability of salmon farming.",Autocatalytic Decomplexation of Cu(II)-EDTA and Simultaneous Removal of Aqueous Cu(II) by UV/Chlorine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653306,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 19,"Traditional processes usually cannot enable efficient water decontamination from toxic heavy metals complexed with organic ligands. Herein, we first reported the removal of Cu(II)-EDTA by a UV/chlorine process, where the Cu(II)-EDTA degradation obeyed autocatalytic two-stage kinetics, and Cu(II) was simultaneously removed as CuO precipitate. The scavenging experiments and EPR analysis indicated that Cl• accounted for the Cu(II)-EDTA degradation at diffusion-controlled rate (∼1010 M-1 s-1). Mechanism study with mass spectrometry evidence of 11 key intermediates revealed that the Cu(II)-EDTA degradation by UV/chlorine was an autocatalytic successive decarboxylation process mediated by the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle. Under UV irradiation, Cu(I) was generated during the photolysis of the Cl•-attacked complexed Cu(II) via ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). Both free and organic ligand-complexed Cu(I) could form binary/ternary complexes with ClO-, which were oxidized back to Cu(II) via metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) with simultaneous production of Cl•, resulting in the autocatalytic effect on Cu(II)-EDTA removal. Effects of chlorine dosage and pH were examined, and the technological practicability was validated with authentic electroplating wastewater and other Cu(II)-organic complexes. This study shed light on a new mechanism of decomplexation by Cl• and broadened the applicability of the promising UV/chlorine process in water treatment.",Sand Barriers around Latrine Pits Reduce Fecal Bacterial Leaching into Shallow Groundwater: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Coastal Bangladesh.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653305,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 19,"We evaluated the effectiveness of a sand barrier around latrine pits in reducing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) leaching into shallow groundwater. We constructed 68 new offset single pit pour flush latrines in the Galachipa subdistrict of coastal Bangladesh. We randomly assigned 34 latrines to include a 50 cm thick sand barrier under and around the pit and 34 received no sand barrier. Four monitoring wells were constructed around each pit to collect water samples at baseline and subsequent nine follow-up visits over 24 months. Samples were tested using the IDEXX Colilert method to enumerate E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms most probable number (MPN). We determined the difference in mean log10MPN FIB counts/100 mL in monitoring well samples between latrines with and without a sand barrier using multilevel linear models and reported cluster robust standard error. The sand barrier latrine monitoring well samples had 0.38 mean log10MPN fewer E. coli (95% CI: 0.16, 0.59; p = 0.001) and 0.38 mean log10MPN fewer thermotolerant coliforms (95% CI: 0.14, 0.62; p = 0.002), compared to latrines without sand barriers, a reduction of 27% E. coli and 24% thermotolerant coliforms mean counts. A sand barrier can modestly reduce the risk presented by pit leaching.",CRIF1-CDK2 Interface Inhibitors: An Unprecedented Strategy for Modulation of Cell Radiosensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653304,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 01 30,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are historic therapeutic targets implicated in tumorigenic events due to their critical involvement in the cell cycle phase. However, selectivity has proven to be a bottleneck, causing repeated failures. Previously, we reported CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1), acting as a cell cycle negative regulator through interaction with CDK2. In the current report, we identified the CRIF1-CDK2 interaction interface by in silico studies and shortlisted interface inhibitors through virtual screening on CRIF1 using 40 678 drug-like compounds. These compounds were tested by cell proliferation assay, and four of these molecules were found to selectively inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, but do not affect normal bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). A binding study reveals significant affinities of the inhibitors on CRIF1. More importantly, treatment of the OS cells with a combination of ionizing radiation (IR) and the best-performing inhibitors remarkably increased IR inhibition potential from 19.9% to 59.6%. This occurred by selectively promoting G2/M arrest and apoptosis related to CDK2 overactivation in OS cells but not in BMSC and was supported by significant CDK2 phosphorylation modifications. Knocking down of CRIF1 by siRNA treatment showed similar effects to the interface inhibitors. Together we substantiate the identification of novel lead molecules, which may provide a new treatment to overcome selectivity issues and enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, opening a conceptually novel strategy of CDK-targeting for different cancer types.",Thiopeptide Pyridine Synthase TbtD Catalyzes an Intermolecular Formal Aza-Diels-Alder Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653303,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 06,"Thiopeptide pyridine synthases catalyze a multistep reaction involving a unique and nonspontaneous intramolecular aza-[4 + 2] cycloaddition between two dehydroalanines to forge a trisubstituted pyridine core. We discovered that the in vitro activity of pyridine synthases from the thiocillin and thiomuracin pathways are significantly enhanced by general base catalysis and that this broadly expands the enzymes substrate tolerance. Remarkably, TbtD is competent to perform an intermolecular cyclization in addition to its cognate intramolecular reaction, underscoring its versatility as a biocatalyst. These data provide evidence that pyridine synthases use a two-site substrate recognition model to engage and process their substrates.",TP10-Dopamine Conjugate as a Potential Therapeutic Agent in the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653302,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 03 20,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which the current treatment is not fully satisfactory. One of the major drawbacks of current PD therapy is poor penetration of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In recent years, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as Tat, SynB, or TP10 have gained great interest due to their ability to penetrate cell membranes and to deliver different cargos to their targets including the central nervous system (CNS). However, there is no data with respect to the use of CPPs as drug carriers to the brain for the treatment of PD. In the presented research, the covalent TP10-dopamine conjugate was synthesized and its pharmacological properties were characterized in terms of its ability to penetrate the BBB and anti-parkinsonian activity. The results showed that dopamine (DA) in the form of a conjugate with TP10 evidently gained access to the brain tissue, exhibited low susceptibility to O-methylation reaction by catechol- O-methyltransferase (lower than that of DA), possessed a relatively high affinity to both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (in the case of D1, a much higher than that of DA), and showed anti-parkinsonian activity (higher than that of l-DOPA) in the MPTP-induced preclinical animal model of PD. The presented results prove that the conjugation of TP10 with DA may be a good starting point for the development of a new strategy for the treatment of PD.",Solvation Effects on the Permeation and Aging Performance of PIM-1-Based MMMs for Gas Separation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653301,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 26,"Membranes are particularly attractive for lowering the energy intensity of separations as they eliminate phase changes. While many tantalizing polymers are known, limitations in selectivity and stability slightly preclude further development. Mixed-matrix membranes may address these shortcomings. Key to their realization is the intimate mixing between the polymer and the additive to eliminate nonselective transport, improve selectivity, and resist physical aging. Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) have inherently promising gas transport properties. Here, we show that porous additives can improve transport and resist aging in PIM-1. We develop a simple, low-cost, and scalable hyper-cross-linked polymer (poly-dichloroxylene, pDCX), which was hydroxylated to form an intimate mixture with the polar PIM-1. Solvent variation allowed control of physical aging rates and improved selectivity for smaller gases. This detailed study has allowed many interactions within mixed matrix membranes to be directly elucidated and presents a practical means to stabilize porous polymers for separation applications.",Unusual Electronic States and Superconducting Proximity Effect of Bi Films Modulated by a NbSe2 Substrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653300,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"Heterostructures of two-dimensional layered materials can be functionalized with exotic phenomena that are unpresented with each constituting component. The interface effect plays a key role in determining the electronic properties of the heterostructure, whose characterization requires a correlation with the morphology with atomic-scale precision. Here, we report an investigation on the electronic properties of few-layer Bi(110) films mediated by a NbSe2 substrate. By utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we show a significant variation of the density of states at different Bi film thicknesses, resulting in an unusual superconducting proximity effect that deviates from the conventional monotonous decay behavior. Moreover, the electronic states of the Bi films are also prominently modulated by the Moiré pattern spatially. With first-principles calculations, we illuminate these findings as the results of covalent-like quasi-bonds formed at the Bi/NbSe2 interface, which profoundly alter the charge distributions in the Bi films. Our study indicates a viable way of modulating the electronic properties of ultrathin films by quasi-covalent interfacial couplings beyond conventional van der Waals interactions.","Materials, Structures, and Functions for Flexible and Stretchable Biomimetic Sensors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653299,Accounts of chemical research,2019 02 19,"Currently, flexible and stretchable biomimetic sensing electronics have obtained a great deal of attention in various areas, such as human-machine interfaces, robotic smart skins, health care monitoring, and biointegrated devices. In contrast with the traditional rigid and fragile silicon-based electronics, flexible and stretchable sensing electronics can efficiently capture high-quality signals when integrated on curved surfaces due to their elastic and conformal characters, which are expected to play many important roles in the foreseeable age of intelligence. Its realization strongly relies on rapid advances in the development of high-performance and versatile flexible and stretchable sensors, and effective ways to achieve high performance are rational designs of the sensing materials and microstructural configurations. This Account showcases the recent progress in flexible and stretchable biomimetic sensors covering several critical aspects of materials, structures, and applications. Nature-inspired active matter and architectures, which have been well-tuned by evolution through millions of years of optimization, provide us the best learning choices to overcome the restrictions of current sensor techniques such as low sensitivity, instability, and delayed response time. Biomimetic sensing materials and microstructural patterns can efficiently acquire synthetic response abilities, endowing the new-type flexible sensors considered as ""smart"" electronic components on account of the counterparts to living organisms. Moreover, the developments of diverse functions and multifunctional applications become more and more important in the creation of novel flexible electronics beyond those existing technologies. For instance, flexible and stretchable sensors with the capability of mimicking various human behavioral patterns can be developed to boost the emergence of artificial robots, which can take the place of human beings in strenuous activities, enabling progress in social science, technology, and productivity to improve the quality of human life. For the above purpose, inspired by the in-depth understanding of working principles of living organisms how to operate their natural characteristics, sensing materials with stimuli response (light, humidity, mechanics, etc.) and multifunctionalities (superhydrophobicity, degradation, self-healing, etc.) provide distinctive and multiple detection features generally encountered in their traditional counterparts. In addition, artificial micro- to nanostructures derived from naturally existing high sensitivity structures (such as insect crack or leaves) and stretchable configurations (wrinkle, texture, mesostructures, etc.) offer additional feasible strategies for producing favorable sensitivity and stretchability. Flexible and stretchable biomimetic sensors with analogous senses to those of human beings (such as tactile and auditory senses) have attracted tremendous attention for their diverse applications for next generation smart electronics. The long-term progress of these novel sensors influencing the next generations of bioinspired intelligence systems and medical electronics are also envisioned.","Bispyrene-Based Self-Assembled Nanomaterials: In Vivo Self-Assembly, Transformation, and Biomedical Effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653298,Accounts of chemical research,2019 02 19,"Self-assembled nanomaterials show potential high efficiency as theranostic agents for high-performance imaging and therapy. However, superstructures and properties of preassembled nanomaterials are somewhat compromised under complicated physiological conditions. Given the advantages of the dynamic nature and adaptive behavior of self-assembly systems, we propose an ""in vivo self-assembly"" strategy for in situ construction of nanomaterials in living objects. For the proof-of-concept study of in vivo self-assembly, we developed a bispyrene (BP) molecule as a multifunctional building block. BP molecules show nonfluorescence in the monomeric state. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate that BP forms twisted intramolecular charge transfer states, which are separated into two orthogonal units, preventing the fluorescence emission. Interestingly, the typical excimeric emission of BP is observed with the formation of J-type aggregates, as confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Packing of the BP molecules generates parallel pyrene units that interact with adjacent ones in a slipped face-to-face fashion through intermolecular π-π interactions. BP and/or its amphiphilic derivatives are capable of self-aggregating into nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solution because of the hydrophobic and π-π interactions of BP. Upon specific biological stimuli, BP NPs can be transformed into variable self-assembled superstructures. Importantly, the self-assembled BP NPs exhibit turn-on fluorescence signals that can be used to monitor the self-assembly/disassembly process in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of the photophysical properties of BP and its aggregates, we synthesized a series of designed BP derivatives as building blocks for in situ construction of functional nanomaterials for bioimaging and/or therapeutics. We observed several new biomedical effects, e.g., (i) the assembly/aggregation-induced retention (AIR) effect, which shows improved accumulation and retention of bioactive nanomaterials in the regions of interests; (ii) the transformation-induced surface adhesion (TISA) effect, which means the BP NPs transform into nanofibers (NFs) on cell surfaces upon binding with specific receptors, which leads to less uptake of BP NPs by cells via traditional endocytosis pathway; and (iii) transformation of the BP NPs into NFs in the tumor microenvironment, showing high accumulation and long-term retention, revealing the transformation-enhanced accumulation and retention (TEAR) effect. In this Account, we summarize the fluorescence property and emission mechanism of BP building blocks upon aggregation in the biological environment. Moreover, BP-derived compounds used for in vivo self-assembly and transformation are introduced involving modulation strategies. Subsequently, unexpected biomedical effects and applications for theranostics of BP based nanomaterials are discussed. We finally conclude with an outlook toward future developments of BP-based self-assembled nanomaterials."

Furthermore, it is shown that such an NIR irradiation can be employed as a modulatory terminal to emulate heterosynaptic plasticity. The reconfigurable 2D image recognition is also demonstrated by an RRAM crossbar array. NIR annihilation effect in quasiplane MoSe2 /Bi2 Se3 nanosheets may open a path toward optical-modulated in-memory computing and artificial retinal prostheses.",Perfluoroheptane-Loaded Hollow Gold Nanoshells Reduce Nanobubble Threshold Flux.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653279,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 15,"The threshold flux for nanobubble formation and liposome rupture is reduced by 50-60% by adding a liquid mixture of tetradecanol and perfluoroheptane to the interior cavity of 40 nm diameter hollow gold nanoshells (HGN), and allowing the tetradecanol to solidify to hold the perfluoroheptane in place. On absorption of picosecond pulses of near-infrared light, the perfluoroheptane vaporizes to initiate cavitation-like nanobubbles as the HGN temperature increases. The lower spinodal temperature and heat capacity of perfluoroheptane relative to water causes the threshold flux for nanobubble formation to decrease. The perfluoroheptane-containing HGN can be linked via thiol-PEG-lipid tethers to carboxyfluorescein-containing liposomes and shows a similar decreased flux necessary for liposome contents release.",Insights from the crystal structure of the chicken CREB3 bZIP suggest that members of the CREB3 subfamily transcription factors may be activated in response to oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653278,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2019 04 01,"cAMP response element binding Protein 3 (CREB3) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound transcription factor, which belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) superfamily of eukaryotic transcription factors. CREB3 plays a role in the ER-stress induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and is a multifunctional cellular factor implicated in a number of biological processes including cell proliferation and migration, tumor suppression, and immune-related gene expression. To gain structural insights into the transcription factor, we determined the crystal structure of the conserved bZIP domain of chicken CREB3 (chCREB3) to a resolution of 3.95 Å. The X-ray structure provides evidence that chCREB3 can form a stable homodimer. The chCREB3 bZIP has a structured, pre-formed DNA binding region, even in the absence of DNA, a feature that could potentially enhance both the DNA binding specificity and affinity of chCREB3. Significantly, the homodimeric bZIP possesses an intermolecular disulfide bond that connects equivalent cysteine residues of the parallel helices in the leucine zipper region. This disulfide bond in the hydrophobic core of the bZIP may increase the stability of the homodimer under oxidizing conditions. Moreover, sequence alignment of bZIP sequences from chicken, human, and mouse reveals that only members of the CREB3 subfamily contain this cysteine residue, indicating that it could act as a redox-sensor. Taken together, these results suggest that the activity of these transcription factors may be redox-regulated and they may be activated in response to oxidative stress.",Exploring Diurnal Cortisol Rhythms of Kindergarten Teachers in Kosovo and Ukraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653277,American journal of community psychology,2019 01 17,"Teachers' stress is a dynamic combination of the individual teacher's characteristics and characteristics of the classroom and school environment. To date, there are limited studies on teachers' stress in the context of lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), where working conditions as well as general political and economic circumstances might pose a considerable threat for teachers' well-being. This study explores whether certain combinations of individual and environmental experiences of teachers in LMICs may result in stress, assessed as patterns of diurnal cortisol rhythm. Participants were kindergarten teachers in Kosovo and Ukraine, two LMICs in Europe. Latent Profile Analysis identified three subgroups of teachers that significantly differed on teachers' education and experience. Preliminary results of Latent Growth Modeling suggested differences between profiles in baseline waking cortisol and patterns of diurnal decline. Teachers in the profile that was characterized by the longest experience working in the field but the lowest level of education showed blunted cortisol in the morning and a flatter slope; a pattern that could indicate a maladaptive cortisol response. Future directions for studying stress processes among teachers in LMICs and implications for policy and practice on how to support teacher well-being in low-resource contexts are discussed.",A novel method for removing contaminant Hsp70 molecular chaperones from recombinant proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653276,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2019 03 29,"The production of recombinant proteins in bacteria has increased significantly in recent years, becoming a common tool for both research and the industrial production of proteins. One of the requirements of this methodology is to obtain the desired protein without contaminants. However, this goal cannot always be readily achieved. Multiple strategies have been developed to improve the quality of the desired protein product. Nevertheless, contamination with molecular chaperones is one of the recalcitrant problems that still affects the quality of the obtained proteins. The ability of chaperones to bind to unfolded proteins or to regions where the polypeptide chain is exposed make the removal of the contamination during purification challenging to achieve. This work aimed to develop a strategy to remove contaminating DnaK, one of the homologous Hsp70 molecular chaperones found in Escherichia coli, from purified recombinant proteins. For this purpose, we developed a methodology that captures the DnaK from the contaminating proteins by co-incubation with a GST-cleanser protein that has free functional binding sites for the chaperone. The cleanser protein can then be easily removed together with the captured DnaK. Here, we demonstrated the utility of our system by decontaminating a Histidine-tagged recombinant protein in a batch process. The addition of the GST-cleanser protein in the presence of ATP-Mg eliminates the DnaK contamination substantially. Thus, our decontaminant strategy results versatile and straightforward and can be applied to proteins obtained with different expression and purifications systems as well as to small samples or large volume preparations.",Heparanase-1 activity and the early postnatal prostate development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653275,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,2019 03 01,"Ventral prostate (VP) morphogenesis starts during embryonic development and continues for the first three postnatal weeks. Heparan sulfate (HS) affects paracrine signaling. Heparanase-1 (HPSE) is the only enzyme capable of cleaving HS. HPSE releases the HS bioactive fragment and mobilizes growth factors. Little is known, however, about HS turnover and HPSE function during VP morphogenesis. In this study, we measured HSPG expression and analyzed the expression and distribution of HPSE in the rat VP. HPSE was predominantly expressed by the VP epithelium. The VP was treated with heparin in ex vivo cultures to interfere with HS and resulted in delayed epithelial growth. Hpse knockdown using siRNA delayed epithelial growth in the first postnatal week ex vivo, which was similar to treating with the lower concentration of heparin. Hpse silencing was related to changes in HS chain length (as determined by size-exclusion chromatography, up-regulation of Mmp9, and down-regulation of Mmp2 expression). It also down-modulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a reduction in signaling, likely due to decreased HS cleavage and growth factor bioavailability. Our results showed that HPSE played a role in early epithelial growth during the first week of VP postnatal development.

However, the scalable fabrication of fiber electrodes with high electrical conductivity and excellent energy storage performance for use in FSCs remains a challenge. Here, an easily scalable one-step wet-spinning approach is reported to fabricate highly conductive fibers using hybrid formulations of Ti3 C2 Tx MXene nanosheets and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate. This approach produces fibers with a record conductivity of ≈1489 S cm-1 , which is about five times higher than other reported Ti3 C2 Tx MXene-based fibers (up to ≈290 S cm-1 ). The hybrid fiber at ≈70 wt% MXene shows a high volumetric capacitance (≈614.5 F cm-3 at 5 mV s-1 ) and an excellent rate performance (≈375.2 F cm-3 at 1000 mV s-1 ). When assembled into a free-standing FSC, the energy and power densities of the device reach ≈7.13 Wh cm-3 and ≈8249 mW cm-3 , respectively. The excellent strength and flexibility of the hybrid fibers allow them to be wrapped on a silicone elastomer fiber to achieve an elastic FSC with 96% capacitance retention when cyclically stretched to 100% strain. This work demonstrates the potential of MXene-based fiber electrodes and their scalable production for fiber-based energy storage applications.","A liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method to simultaneously determinate chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid and imidacloprid metabolites in wheat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653273,Journal of separation science,2019 03 25,"A liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated to simultaneously determine chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, and imidacloprid metabolites in soil, wheat grain, and wheat straw matrices.

The ranges of limits of detection and limits of quantification for seven analytes in three matrices were 0.17-66.7 and 0.5-200 μg/kg, respectively. Average recoveries were 72.85-81.25% for chlorpyrifos, 78.54-84.70% for imidacloprid, 73.83-81.03% for imidacloprid olefin, 71.47-80.61% for 5-hydroxy imidacloprid, 71.79-81.32% for imidacloprid urea, 70.42-82.20% for imidacloprid nitroguanidine, and 70.91-82.46% for imidacloprid 6-chloronicotinic acid in soil, wheat grain, and wheat straw.

The established method was successfully applied for the residual analysis of chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, and imidacloprid metabolites in actual soil, wheat grain, and wheat straw samples. The results indicated that the established method could be used to detect trace amounts of chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, and imidacloprid metabolites in wheat and that the method might be able to provide some data on the detection of these seven compounds in other crops.",12.5% Flexible Nonfullerene Solar Cells by Passivating the Chemical Interaction Between the Active Layer and Polymer Interfacial Layer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653271,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 28,"Nonfullerene (NF) organic solar cells (OSCs) have been attracting significant attention in the past several years. It is still challenging to achieve high-performance flexible NF OSCs. NF acceptors are chemically reactive and tend to react with the low-temperature-processed low-work-function (low-WF) interfacial layers, such as polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE), which leads to the ""S"" shape in the current-density characteristics of the cells. In this work, the chemical interaction between the NF active layer and the polymer interfacial layer of PEIE is deactivated by increasing its protonation. The PEIE processed from aqueous solution shows more protonated N+ than that processed from isopropyl alcohol solution, observed from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. NF solar cells (active layer: PCE-10:IEICO-4F) with the protonated PEIE interfacial layer show an efficiency of 13.2%, which is higher than the reference cells with a ZnO interlayer (12.6%). More importantly, the protonated PEIE interfacial layer processed from aqueous solution does not require a further thermal annealing treatment (only processing at room temperature). The room-temperature processing and effective WF reduction enable the demonstration of high-performance (12.5%) flexible NF OSCs.",Crystal structure and calcium-induced conformational changes of diacylglycerol kinase α EF-hand domains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653270,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2019 03 29,"Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are multi-domain lipid kinases that phosphorylate diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid, modulating the levels of these key signaling lipids. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to DGKα isozyme as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. We have previously shown that DGKα is positively regulated by Ca2+ binding to its N-terminal EF-hand domains (DGKα-EF). However, little progress has been made for the structural biology of mammalian DGKs and the molecular mechanism underlying the Ca2+ -triggered activation remains unclear. Here we report the first crystal structure of Ca2+ -bound DGKα-EF and analyze the structural changes upon binding to Ca2+ . DGKα-EF adopts a canonical EF-hand fold, but unexpectedly, has an additional α-helix (often called a ligand mimic [LM] helix), which is packed into the hydrophobic core. Biophysical and biochemical analyses reveal that DGKα-EF adopts a protease-susceptible ""open"" conformation without Ca2+ that tends to form a dimer. Cooperative binding of two Ca2+ ions dissociates the dimer into a well-folded monomer, which resists to proteolysis. Taken together, our results provide experimental evidence that Ca2+ binding induces substantial conformational changes in DGKα-EF, which likely regulates intra-molecular interactions responsible for the activation of DGKα and suggest a possible role of the LM helix for the Ca2+ -induced conformational changes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), which modulates the levels of two lipid second messengers, diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid, is still structurally enigmatic enzymes since its first identification in 1959. We here present the first crystal structure of EF-hand domains of diacylglycerol kinase α in its Ca2+ bound form and characterize Ca2+ -induced conformational changes, which likely regulates intra-molecular interactions. Our study paves the way for future studies to understand the structural basis of DGK isozymes."

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and clinical utility of comprehensive, NGS-based genetic profiling for routine workup of advanced NSCLC based on the first 3,000 patients analyzed in our department. Following automated extraction of DNA and RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, parallel sequencing of DNA and RNA for detection of mutations and gene fusions, respectively, was performed using PCR-based enrichment with an ion semiconductor sequencing platform. Overall, 807 patients (27%) were eligible for currently approved, EGFR-/BRAF-/ALK- and ROS1-directed therapies, while 218 additional cases (7%) with MET, ERBB2 (HER2) and RET alterations could potentially benefit from experimental targeted compounds.

This review was performed to assess the rate of adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of CPI, alone or in combinations. A review of AEs reporting quality was also performed. All publications of Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) assessing CPI published before December 2017 were included. To investigate the quality of AEs reporting, a set of items was defined based on the 2004 CONSORT harms extension statement. Rates of Grade 5, serious, and study-withdrawal related AEs were collected in each treatment category. Specific immune related AEs (irAEs) were also collected when available. Pooled estimates of adverse event rates were calculated by using generalized linear mixed model. A total of 35 RCTs including 16,485 patients were included. The overall quality of AEs reporting was satisfactory, but items pertaining to methods of data collection and analysis were infrequently reported. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported for 14% (95% CI 12-16) of patients treated with PD(L)-1 inhibitors, 34% (95% CI 27-42) of patients treated with CTLA-4 inhibitors, 55% (95% CI 51-59) of patients on CPI combinations and 46% (95% CI 40-53) of patients on immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination. The profile of irAEs was different among the treatment categories. The use of CPI, especially in combination, is associated with significant rates of Grade ≥ 3 AEs.

Bladder cancer shares several risk factors with lung cancer and some positive associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk have been observed. This study examined associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk in the large-scale Spanish Bladder Cancer Study. Estimates of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) concentrations were assigned to the geocoded participant residence of 938 incident bladder cancer cases and 973 hospital controls based on European multicity land-use regression models. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. Overall, there was no clear association between either ambient PM2.5 (OR per 5.9 μg/m3  = 1.06, 95% CI 0.71-1.60) or NO2 (OR per 14.2 μg/m3  = 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.13) concentrations and incident bladder cancer risk. There was no clear evidence for effect modification according to age group, sex, region, education, cigarette smoking status, or pack-years. Results were also similar among more residentially stable participants and in two-pollutant models.

The criteria are based on quantitative thresholds relating to the size, trends, and structure of species' distributions and populations. However, data on these parameters are sparse and uncertain for many species and unavailable for others, potentially leading to their misclassification or classification as data deficient. We devised an approach that combines data on land-cover change, species-specific habitat preferences, population abundance, and dispersal distance to estimate key parameters (extent of occurrence, maximum area of occupancy, population size and trend, and degree of fragmentation) and hence predict IUCN Red List categories for species. We applied our approach to nonpelagic birds and terrestrial mammals globally (∼15,000 species). The predicted categories were fairly consistent with published IUCN Red List assessments, but more optimistic overall. We predicted 4.2% of species (467 birds and 143 mammals) to be more threatened than currently assessed and 20.2% of data deficient species (10 birds and 114 mammals) to be at risk of extinction. Incorporating the habitat fragmentation subcriterion reduced these predictions 1.5-2.3% and 6.4-14.9% (depending on the quantitative definition of fragmentation) for threatened and data deficient species, respectively, highlighting the need for improved guidance for IUCN Red List assessors on the application of this aspect of the IUCN Red List criteria. Our approach complements traditional methods of estimating parameters for IUCN Red List assessments. Furthermore, it readily provides an early-warning system to identify species potentially warranting changes in their extinction-risk category based on periodic updates of land-cover information. Given our method relies on optimistic assumptions about species distribution and abundance, all species predicted to be more at risk than currently evaluated should be prioritized for reassessment.",Risk of Parkinson's disease dementia related to level I MDS PD-MCI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653248,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2019 06 16,The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society criteria for mild cognitive impairment in PD need validation.

Numerous publications warn about the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, as well as the potential role of vitamin D in non-bone health outcomes. The status of vitamin D is usually assessed by measuring serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration. This is the major circulating form of vitamin D and keeps an inverse correlation with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration. A value of 25OHD of 20 ng/ml is generally assumed as threshold of vitamin D sufficiency in epidemiologic studies because serum PTH tends to increase when the 25OHD concentration stands below this value. In pediatric population, very few studies have analyzed this issue and the negative relationship between serum 25OHD and serum PTH is not clear, which is the suitable circulating concentration of 25OHD and the threshold of deficiency being matters of controversy. The majority of 25OHD circulates in serum tightly bound to a globulin (DBP). According to the free hormone hypothesis, protein-bound hormones are not biologically available and it is the free form that exerts or facilitates the physiologic actions. If this is true, factors that affect DBP may alter the interpretation of total serum 25OHD measurements.",Independent and combined influence of healthy lifestyle factors on academic performance in adolescents: DADOS Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653194,Pediatric research,2019 03 02,"Few studies have analyzed the combined effect of lifestyle factors on academic performance (AP) in adolescents.

Their immune and hematopoietic functionality changes had been evaluated at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3-year(s) IST.For SAA patients with complete remission (CR), the CD4/CD8T cell ratio continued to increase after a year of IST. The T helper (Th)1/Th2 ratio continued to decrease after 6 months of IST, as did the activated CD8 T cell percentage. The myeloid dendritic cell (mDC)/plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) ratio after 3 years of IST was significantly lower compared to that of untreated patients.

Brain metastases are a common cause of mortality in NSCLC patients. For epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type patients, therapeutic options for BM are even limited. Pemetrexed-based therapy is a standard care for patients with EGFR-negative, nonsquamous NSCLC. Besides local therapy, pemetrexed is the preferred chemotherapy for wild-type BM patients, but the efficacy is uncertain.We retrospectively studied 138 NSCLC patients with BM whose EGFR status were unknown or wild-type. All patients received first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy from 2010 to 2015. Forty-six of 89 patients with unknown EGFR status were treated with EGFR TKIs after progression.Among the 138 patients, 49 (35.5%) were EGFR wild-type and 89 (64.5%) were unknown EGFR status. The median overall survival (OS), and the median intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) was 21.0 months, 9.5 months, respectively. Patients who received more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy had significantly longer OS than those who received 3 to 4 cycles (Mantel-Byar X-squared = 6.65, P = .001). In the EGFR wild-type group, the median OS, and the median iPFS was 17.7 months, 7.6 months, respectively. And patients treated with pemetrexed plus platinum tended to have a longer OS than those who were treated with pemetrexed alone (P = .078). In the subgroup with unknown EGFR status, we noted a statistically significant improvement in OS for the patients who received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after progression of 29 months compared to 20.3 months of the EGFR TKIs naïve arm (P = .027).Pemetrexed shows an ideal effectiveness in EGFR wild-type and unknown status NSCLC patients with BM, and has a favorable control on brain localizations.

Neuropathy of small nerve fibers has been implicated due to related pain descriptors, psychophysical pain, and neurophysiological testing, as well as skin biopsy studies. Nevertheless, this alteration alone has not been previously associated to the dysfunction in the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) that is observed in FM. We hypothesize that they associated, thus, we conducted a cross-sectional exploratory study.To explore small fiber dysfunction using quantitative sensory testing (QST) is associated with the DPMS and other surrogates of nociceptive pathways alterations in FM.We run a cross-sectional study and recruited 41 women with FM, and 28 healthy female volunteers. We used the QST to measure the thermal heat threshold (HTT), heat pain threshold (HPT), heat pain tolerance (HPT), heat pain tolerance (HPTo), and conditional pain modulation task (CPM-task). Algometry was used to determine the pain pressure threshold (PPT). Scales to assess catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were also applied. Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was measured as a marker of neuroplasticity. We run multivariate linear regression models by group to study their relationships.Samples differed in their psychophysical profile, where FM presented lower sensitivity and pain thresholds. In FM but not in the healthy subjects, regression models revealed that serum BDNF was related to HTT and CPM-Task (Hotelling Trace = 1.80, P < .001, power = 0.94, R = 0.64). HTT was directly related to CPM-Task (B = 0.98, P = .004, partial-η = 0.25), and to HPT (B = 1.61, P = .008, partial η = 0.21), but not to PPT. Meanwhile, BDNF relationship to CPM-Task was inverse (B = -0.04, P = .043, partial-η = 0.12), and to HPT was direct (B = -0.08, P = .03, partial-η = 0.14).These findings high spot that in FM the disinhibition of the DPMS is positively correlated with the dysfunction in peripheral sensory neurons assessed by QST and conversely with serum BDNF.","Effects of selenium supplementation on pregnancy outcome and disease progression in HIV-infected pregnant women in Lagos, Nigeria: Study protocol for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653086,Medicine,2019 02 24,"Micronutrient deficiencies are common during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women from economically disadvantaged settings where diets with low content of minerals and vitamins are consumed.

Most of these polyps have morphologic features of traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) admixed with areas resembling sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) or hyperplastic polyp (HP). Based on these findings it has been suggested that at least some TSAs may arise in association with precursor HP or SSA lesions, particularly those that develop in right colon. To further evaluate this hypothesis, 39 serrated polyps from right side of the colon (cecum, ascending, and transverse colon) with mixed features of TSA and SSA were evaluated by 2 immunostains previously shown to represent markers of SSA. One is Annexin A10 which shows upregulated expression in SSA and the other is Hes-1 which is shown to be down regulated in SSA. The expression patterns of these markers were evaluated in SSA and TSA components of hybrid polyps and compared with control groups (pure SSAs and TSAs of right colon). SSA component in hybrid polyps did not show any significant difference in staining pattern compared with that seen in TSA component of hybrid polyps or in pure TSA polyps.

In this report, we present our experience with 7 lymphoma cases of various histologic types with coexisting granuloma to show the diagnostic challenges. In all cases, a granulomatous reaction was simultaneously present with the neoplastic cells. The 7 cases included 3 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in the lymph node or skin including one coexisting with mycobacterial infection, 2 cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma involving the liver, and 1 case each of systemic Epstein-Barr virus-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma and a hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor-like follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. Three cases were initially misdiagnosed as reactive change or mycobacterial infection instead of lymphoma, and a wrong histologic lymphoma type was diagnosed in 1 case. In this report, we showed that granulomatous reaction might mask lymphomas of various histologic types; and a diagnosis of mycobacterial infection or sarcoidosis could not exclude the possibility of an underlying lymphoma.

After clinical improvement under vemurafenib monotherapy, four cycles of ipilimumab were additionally administered. F-FDG PET/CT was performed before the start, after two cycles and after completion of the combined ipilimumab/vemurafenib treatment. PET-based patient response evaluation to treatment was based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) from the end of combination treatment was calculated. According to their best clinical response at the end of combination treatment, eight patients showed CB and eight patients had no-CB. Two patients revealed extraordinary good clinical outcome with PFS of more than 5 years. Overall, 13 out of 16 patients were correctly classified by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and 15 out of 16 by the PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy criteria. Median PFS was 8.8 months among PET-responders and 3.6 months among nonresponders. During immunotherapy administration seven patients developed radiologic signs of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), with colitis and arthritis being the most frequent ones; these patients had a significantly longer PFS than those without irAEs (P=0.036). F-FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool for the evaluation of patients receiving a combination of targeted treatment and immunotherapy.

Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that repress proinflammatory stimuli, but their role in the stomach is unknown. In this study, we show that endogenous glucocorticoids are required to maintain gastric homeostasis. Removal of circulating glucocorticoids in mice by adrenalectomy resulted in the rapid onset of spontaneous gastric inflammation, oxyntic atrophy, and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), a putative precursor of gastric cancer. SPEM and oxyntic atrophy occurred independently of lymphocytes. However, depletion of monocytes and macrophages by clodronate treatment or inhibition of gastric monocyte infiltration using the Cx3cr1 knockout mouse model prevented SPEM development. Our results highlight the requirement for endogenous glucocorticoid signaling within the stomach to prevent spontaneous gastric inflammation and metaplasia, and suggest that glucocorticoid deficiency may lead to gastric cancer development.",Cost-effectiveness of second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents in chronic HCV infection: a systematic literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652971,Antiviral therapy,2019 01 17,Our objectives were to review the economic modelling methods and cost-effectiveness of second generation direct-acting antiviral agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,TRIM28 promotes HIV-1 latency by SUMOylating CDK9 and inhibiting P-TEFb.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652970,eLife,2019 02 07,"Comprehensively elucidating the molecular mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latency is a priority to achieve a functional cure. As current 'shock' agents failed to efficiently reactivate the latent reservoir, it is important to discover new targets for developing more efficient latency-reversing agents (LRAs). Here, we found that TRIM28 potently suppresses HIV-1 expression by utilizing both SUMO E3 ligase activity and epigenetic adaptor function. Through global site-specific SUMO-MS study and serial SUMOylation assays, we identified that P-TEFb catalytic subunit CDK9 is significantly SUMOylated by TRIM28 with SUMO4. The Lys44, Lys56 and Lys68 residues on CDK9 are SUMOylated by TRIM28, which inhibits CDK9 kinase activity or prevents P-TEFb assembly by directly blocking the interaction between CDK9 and Cyclin T1, subsequently inhibits viral transcription and contributes to HIV-1 latency.

Maintaining established synaptic connections is essential for generating functional circuitry and synapse instability is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease. While many molecules impact synapse formation generally, we know little about molecules that affect synapse maintenance in vivo. Using genetics and developmental time course analysis in C.elegans, we show that the α-tubulin acetyltransferase ATAT-2 and the signaling hub RPM-1 are required presynaptically to maintain stable synapses. Importantly, the enzymatic acetyltransferase activity of ATAT-2 is required for synapse maintenance. Our analysis revealed that RPM-1 is a hub in a genetic network composed of ATAT-2, PTRN-1 and DLK-1. In this network, ATAT-2 functions independent of the DLK-1 MAPK and likely acts downstream of RPM-1. Thus, our study reveals an important role for tubulin acetyltransferase activity in presynaptic maintenance, which occurs via the RPM-1/ATAT-2 pathway.",Engineering a conserved RNA regulatory protein repurposes its biological function in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652968,eLife,2019 03 07,"PUF (PUmilio/FBF) RNA-binding proteins recognize distinct elements. In C. elegans, PUF-8 binds to an 8-nt motif and restricts proliferation in the germline. Conversely, FBF-2 recognizes a 9-nt element and promotes mitosis. To understand how motif divergence relates to biological function, we first determined a crystal structure of PUF-8. Comparison of this structure to that of FBF-2 revealed a major difference in a central repeat. We devised a modified yeast 3-hybrid screen to identify mutations that confer recognition of an 8-nt element to FBF-2. We identified several such mutants and validated structurally and biochemically their binding to 8-nt RNA elements. Using genome engineering, we generated a mutant animal with a substitution in FBF-2 that confers preferential binding to the PUF-8 element. The mutant largely rescued overproliferation in animals that spontaneously generate tumors in the absence of puf-8.

Serological diagnosis plays an important role in distinguishing pathogen species. Together with the spike (S) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the immunodominant regions among coronaviruses. In this study, two-way antigenic cross-reactivity between the N proteins of PEDV and TGEV was observed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the PEDV N protein harbouring truncations of amino acids (aa) 1 to 170 or aa 125 to 301 was demonstrated to cross-react with the anti-TGEV N polyclonal antibody (PAb), whereas the truncation-expressing aa 302 to 401 resulted in a specific reaction with the anti-PEDV N PAb but not with the anti-TGEV N PAb.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects linked with the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AK089579 on the EMT of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) as well as the associated regulatory mechanisms of AK089579 downstream of tyrosine kinase 2 (DOK2) and microRNA-296-3p (miR-296-3p). Enrichment analysis, gene intersection association analysis, and a gene-gene intersection network were initially constructed to ascertain whether AK089579 regulated the expression of DOK2 through the mediation of miR-296-3p via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in PF. After the PF mouse model had been constructed, the expression of the proteins associated with the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and EMT and PMC migration and invasion were all determined accordingly. Based on the obtained results, AK089579 was determined to function as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-296-3p while acting to up-regulate the expression of DOK2, which is a target gene of miR-296-3p. AK089579 was detected to confer an inhibitory effect on the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, whereby the migration and invasion of PMCs among the mice models were suppressed. Meanwhile, up-regulated miR-296-3p and down-regulated DOK2 produced contrasting effects when compared with the aforementioned findings. Treatment with wp10066, a JAK2/STAS3 signaling pathway inhibitor, was shown to reverse the effects exerted by up-regulated miR-296-3p. Taken together, the central findings of the current study present evidence highlighting the capability of the lncRNA AK089579 to bind competitively to miR-296-3p and indirectly enhance the expression of DOK2, which in turn suppresses the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, whereby the EMT, migration, and invasion of PMCs was inhibited in PF.-Zhang, X.

A detailed look into how to use this concept leads to several unanswered questions. The purpose of this article is to bring forth questions which have remained unanswered for several decades. These questions pertain to our inability to provide needed information to physicians for making benefit-risk assessment for deciding a frequent imaging modality like the computed tomography (CT) such as non-applicability of risk estimates to an individual patient, the concept of cumulative risk at low doses, accounting for the time gap between series of CT scans, risk variation with age, gender and disease condition. In the absence of concrete information on these, it becomes essentially benefit assessment rather than benefit-risk. The article also provides a motivation to think that there are a large number of patients getting exposed every year to radiation doses over 100 mSv of effective dose and several tens of mGy of organ doses. This may provide a very large cohort for radiation effect studies. Further, a series of ideas are presented as a vision for future studies. Conclusions: The article emphasizes the need to create a research agenda to deal with day-to-day questions faced in medical practice and provides a call-for-attention. Further, it provides some challenging ideas as outside of the box thinking points that may provide research direction for future years.",Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell responses to low radiation doses - implications for leukemia risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652952,International journal of radiation biology,2019 02 20,"Studies of the responses of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to low doses of ionizing radiation formed an important aspect of the RISK-IR project ( www.risk-ir.eu ).

The findings confirm the sensitivity of HSPCs to radiation even at low doses, and illustrate the substantial impact that differentiation state has upon cell sensitivity. The work provides mechanistic support for epidemiological findings of leukemia risk at dose levels used in diagnostic CT imaging, and further suggests that low-dose irradiation may facilitate bone marrow transplantation, a finding that could lead to refinements in clinical practice.",Effect of short exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on saliva biomarkers: a study on the electrohypersensitive individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652950,International journal of radiation biology,2019 05 30,"Context: Some individuals are reporting being sensitive to electromagnetic fields.

Youth-therapist and parent-therapist agreement on beliefs about the etiology of the youth's mental health problems were examined in relationship to later treatment engagement. Although parent-therapist agreement was unrelated to parent engagement, youth-therapist coendorsement of etiological beliefs predicted overall youth treatment engagement. In addition, youth-therapist agreement significantly predicted specific aspects of youth engagement: client-therapist interaction, communication/openness, and client's perceived usefulness of treatment. Results speak to the importance of agreement between therapist and youth upon key issues related to the youth's problems in mental health treatment settings and support facilitation of consensus as a component of culturally competent care. Differences between findings for youth and parents suggest that therapeutic relationships may vary for different stakeholders, indicating a need to consider individual perspectives and contributions separately.",Study of biodistribution and systemic toxicity of glucose functionalized SPIO/DOX micelles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652923,Pharmaceutical development and technology,2019 01 17,"The present study examined the cytotoxicity and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) distribution of cancer-targeted, MRI-visible polymeric micelles that encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and are conjugated with glucose as a targeting ligand. In this study, the micelles were characterized by dynamic light scattering to determine particle size and zeta potential. Morphology and structure of the micelles were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. To investigate the clinical potential of glucose-micelles, in vitro cytotoxicity assays of nonencapsulating or SPIO-and-DOX-coencapsulating micelles were performed on L929 mouse fibroblasts, and we found that glucose-micelles did not exert in vitro cytotoxic effects. Next, in vitro MRI detectability of glucose SPIO micelles was evaluated at the loaded SPIO content of 2.5% and 50%, and it was found that glucose-micelles can increase MRI relaxivity (R2*) at high SPIO loading. Furthermore, 50% SPIO micelles persisted in the blood circulation for up to 5 days (slow liver clearance) as determined by in vivo MRI. For in vivo toxicity evaluation, 50% SPIO/DOX micelles at a dose up to 18 (mg DOX)/(kg body weight) showed no impact on animal health according to clinical chemistry and clinical hematology laboratory testing.

For too long, acceptance, silence, passivity, and inaction have been the predominant, albeit ineffective, strategies for coping with microaggressions. Inaction does nothing but support and proliferate biased perpetrator behaviors which occur at individual, institutional and societal levels. This article introduces a new strategic framework developed for addressing microaggressions that moves beyond coping and survival to concrete action steps and dialogues that targets, allies, and bystanders can perform (microinterventions). A review of responses to racist acts, suggest that microaggression reactions/interventions may be primarily to (a) remain passive, retreat, or give up; (b) strike back or hurt the aggressor; (c) stop, diminish, deflect, or put an end to the harmful act; (d) educate the perpetrator; (e) validate and support the targets; (f) act as an ally; (g) seek social support; (h) enlist outside authority or institutional intervention; or (h) achieve any combination of these objectives. We organize these responses into four major strategic goals of microinterventions: (a) make the invisible visible, (b) disarm the microaggression, (c) educate the perpetrator, and (d) seek external reinforcement or support. The objectives and rationale for each goal are discussed, along with specific microintervention tactics to employ and examples of how they are executed.

The idiographic approach was used to understand when Black youth are at risk for negative outcomes in the context of racial discrimination. The current study assessed if within-person changes in racial centrality, private regard, and public regard moderated the daily relation between racial discrimination and depressive symptoms. Daily measures of racial discrimination, ethnic/racial identity, and depressive symptoms were administered to a sample of 103 Black adolescents for 2 weeks. The results suggest that neither racial centrality nor private regard moderated the same-day or lagged associations between daily racial discrimination experiences and daily depressive symptoms. Although low public regard fluctuations evidenced no moderation for the within-day relation, low public regard fluctuations exacerbated the lagged day relation between daily racial discrimination experiences and daily depressive symptoms. When Black youth experienced lower levels of public regard compared to their average levels, previous-day racial discrimination experiences were associated with an increase in depressive symptoms.

Among the many health problems affected by racial discrimination and oppression, both historical and current, are substance use disorders. Epidemiological studies have documented greater drug and alcohol-related morbidity and mortality among AI/AN Alaska Natives compared to other ethnic groups, and culturally appropriate, effective interventions are sorely needed. We collected, as part of a larger community-based participatory research project to address substance use disparities in rural AI communities, qualitative interview data from 25 AI key informants from a frontier reservation in Montana. Using a semistructured interview guide, we asked participants to discuss their perceptions of the causes of substance use problems and barriers to recovery on the reservation. Although no questions specifically asked about discrimination, key informants identified stress from racism as an important precipitant of substance use and barrier to recovery. As one participant stated: ""Oppression is the overarching umbrella for all sickness with drugs and alcohol."" Participants also identified historical trauma resulting from colonization as a manifestation of race-based stress that drives behavioral health problems. Findings suggest that interventions for AIs with substance use disorders, and possibly other chronic health problems, may be more effective if they address social determinants of health such as racial discrimination and historical trauma.

As a result, enormous gaps in knowledge about health and mental health disparities exist, with broad public health significance. In particular, there is an urgent need to attend more specifically to MENA Americans' experiences of cumulative racial-ethnic trauma, which occurs at every level of their social ecologies. This article offers a conceptual model of cumulative racial-ethnic trauma to represent the unique experiences of the MENA American population. Traumatic factors at the macrolevel include historical trauma, pervasive institutional discrimination, and a hostile national context. These factors interact with one another and further impact microlevel traumatic experiences related to interpersonal discrimination and microaggressions, as well as struggles with identity and recognition. The deleterious impacts of these experiences may include a ubiquitous sense of insecurity, hopelessness, and alienation among MENA American individuals, in addition to more specific mental health and physical health concerns. It also compromises the overall well-being of the MENA American population in terms of belonging versus alienation, freedom versus restriction, and opportunities versus disadvantage. We discuss how the model can help to create a foundation for future inquiry and contribute to intervention efforts to find effective ways to support resilience and thriving for the MENA American population.

Research has suggested that race-based traumatic stress can manifest from direct and vicarious discriminatory racial encounters (DREs) that impact individuals during and after an event. To help their children prepare for and prevent the deleterious consequences of DREs, many parents of color utilize racial socialization (RS), or communication about racialized experiences. Although RS research has illuminated associations between RS and youth well-being indicators (i.e., psychosocial, physiological, academic, and identity-related), findings have mainly focused on RS frequency and endorsement in retrospective accounts and not on how RS is transmitted and received, used during in-the-moment encounters, or applied to reduce racial stress and trauma through clinical processes. This article explores how systemic and interpersonal DREs require literate, active, and bidirectional RS to repair from race-based traumatic stress often overlooked by traditional stress and coping models and clinical services. A novel theory (Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory [RECAST]), wherein RS moderates the relationship between racial stress and self-efficacy in a path to coping and well-being, is advanced. Greater RS competency is proposed as achievable through intentional and mindful practice. Given heightened awareness to DREs plaguing youth, better understanding of how RS processes and skills development can help youth and parents heal from the effects of past, current, and future racial trauma is important. A description of proposed measures and RECAST's use within trauma-focused clinical practices and interventions for family led healing is also provided.

We define ethno-racial trauma as the individual and/or collective psychological distress and fear of danger that results from experiencing or witnessing discrimination, threats of harm, violence, and intimidation directed at ethno-racial minority groups. This form of trauma stems from a legacy of oppressive laws, policies, and practices. Using an intersectionality framework, this article discusses the complex ways in which interlocking systems of oppression (e.g., racism, ethnocentrism, nativism, sexism) and anti-immigrant policies impact Latinxs individuals, families, and communities. The article also presents a framework to stimulate healing from ethno-racial trauma titled, HEART (Healing Ethno And Racial Trauma). Grounded in the principles of Liberation Psychology and trauma-informed care, the framework is composed of four phases. Each phase is accompanied by a goal to assist clinicians in helping individuals, families, and communities to achieve growth, wellness, and healing. The main objective of each phase is for Latinx immigrants to find relief, gain awareness, and cope with systemic oppression while encouraging resistance and protection from the external forces that cause ethno-racial trauma. Overall, our intention and hopeful expectation is that the content presented in this article serves as a call to action for psychologists to make psychology a Sanctuary Discipline by using and integrating intersectionality theory, trauma-informed care, and Liberation Psychology into policy, research, and practice with Latinx immigrants.

The mass incarceration was portrayed as necessary to protect the country from potential acts of espionage or sabotage that might be committed by someone of Japanese ancestry. However, an extensive government review initiated in 1980 found no evidence of military necessity to support the removal decision and concluded that the incarceration was a grave injustice fueled by racism and war hysteria. The Japanese American wartime experience represents a powerful case example of race-based historical trauma. This article describes the consequences of the incarceration for Japanese Americans during and after their unjust imprisonment, their coping responses and healing strategies, as well as the impacts of receiving governmental redress more than four decades after the war's end.

As a conceptual precursor to racial trauma, Indigenous historical trauma (IHT) is distinguished by its emphasis on ancestral adversity that is intergenerationally transmitted in ways that compromise descendent well-being. In this systematic review of the health impacts of IHT, 32 empirical articles were identified that statistically analyzed the relationship between a measure of IHT and a health outcome for Indigenous samples from the United States and Canada. These articles were categorized based on their specific method for operationalizing IHT, yielding 19 articles that were grouped as historical loss studies, 11 articles that were grouped as residential school ancestry studies, and three articles that were grouped as ""other"" studies. Articles in all three categories included diverse respondents, disparate designs, varied statistical techniques, and a range of health outcomes. Most reported statistically significant associations between higher indicators of IHT and adverse health outcomes. Analyses were so complex, and findings were so specific, that this groundbreaking literature has yet to cohere into a body of knowledge with clear implications for health policy or professional practice. At the conceptual level, it remains unclear whether IHT is best appreciated for its metaphorical or literal functions. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm surrounding IHT as an explanation for contemporary Indigenous health problems renders it imperative to refine the construct to enable more valid research.

Here, that promise and challenge is explored by tracing HT's theoretical development in terms of its anticolonial ambitions and organizing ideas. Three predominant modes of engaging HT were distilled form the literature (HT as a clinical condition, life stressor, and critical discourse), each informing a research program pursuing a different anticolonial ambition (healing trauma, promoting resilience, practicing survivance) organized by distinct ideas about colonization, wellness, and Indigeneity. Through critical reflection on these different ambitions and dialogue of their organizing ideas, conflict between research programs can be mitigated and a more productive anticolonialism realized in psychology and related health fields. Key recommendations emphasized clarifying clinical concepts (e.g., clinical syndrome vs. idiom of distress), disentangling clinical narratives of individual pathology (e.g., trauma) from social narratives of population adversity (e.g., survivance stories), attending to features of settler-colonialism not easily captured by heath indices (e.g., structural violence), and encouraging alignment of anticolonial efforts with constructive critiques establishing conceptual bridges to disciplines that can help to advance psychological understandings of colonization and Indigenous wellness (e.g., postcolonial studies). This conceptual framework was applied to the RT literature to elaborate similar recommendations for advancing RT theory and the interests of ethnic/racial minority populations through engagement with psychology and related health fields.

Such experiences may include threats of harm and injury, humiliating and shaming events, and witnessing racial discrimination toward other POCI. Although similar to posttraumatic stress disorder, racial trauma is unique in that it involves ongoing individual and collective injuries due to exposure and reexposure to race-based stress. The articles in this special issue introduce new conceptual approaches, research, and healing models to challenge racial trauma. The authors encourage psychologists to develop culturally informed healing modalities and methodologically sophisticated research and urge the inclusion of public policy interventions in the area of racial trauma.

However, depression is a heterogeneous collection of symptoms and all symptoms are unlikely to be associated with these negative cognitive biases. The current study involved 218 community adults whose depression ranged from no symptoms to clinical levels of depression. Random forest machine learning was used to identify the most important depression symptom predictors of each negative cognitive bias. Depression symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Model performance was evaluated using predictive R-squared (Rpred2), the expected variance explained in data not used to train the algorithm, estimated by 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Using the self-referent encoding task (SRET), depression symptoms explained 34% to 45% of the variance in negative self-referent processing. The symptoms of sadness, self-dislike, pessimism, feelings of punishment, and indecision were most important. Notably, many depression symptoms made virtually no contribution to this prediction. In contrast, for attention bias for sad stimuli, measured with the dot-probe task using behavioral reaction time (RT) and eye gaze metrics, no reliable symptom predictors were identified. Findings indicate that a symptom-level approach may provide new insights into which symptoms, if any, are associated with negative cognitive biases in depression.

Two studies examined the roles of perspective taking and rumination as potential mechanisms; results provided most consistent support for the role of perspective taking. The findings are discussed in light of the broader theoretical questions of when and how people forgive and how mindfulness may promote interpersonal functioning.

Students completed the Evaluative Threat in STEM Scale (Ahlqvist, London, & Rosenthal, 2013) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) at six intervals. Cross-sectional and longitudinal measurement invariance was supported. Women reported greater evaluative threat than men, but they did not differ from men in difficulties regulating emotion. Both constructs showed moderate relative stability over time. Using latent change score analyses, significant positive deceleration change patterns indicated that four of the emotion regulation difficulties (Lack of Emotional Awareness, Lack of Emotional Clarity, Impulse Control Difficulties, and Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses) and evaluative threat tended to increase (worsen) over the year, but the increases also slowed (i.e., plateaued) over time. Compared with men, women initially reported higher evaluative threat than men did, but these differences decreased over the year, as women decelerated more quickly than men did. In terms of cross-coupling effects, we found that evaluative threat was associated with subsequent difficulty in identifying strategies to cope with unpleasant emotions. There were no cross-coupling effects for emotion regulation predicting subsequent change in evaluative threat. Gender moderated the Evaluative Threat-to-DERS coupling effects for Lack of Emotional Clarity, Difficulties in Goal-Directed Behavior, and Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses. We discuss implications of evaluative threat for depleting coping resources and some potential psychoeducational and preventive interventions to support students in STEM majors.

Here we report two isostructural asymmetric compounds, RbBPO4F and CsBPO4F. Both compounds crystallize in cubic space group P213 (No. 198) with three-dimensional (3D) gismondine-like structures. Remarkably, in spite of the same basic structural units BO3F and PO4, both structures are distinct from the previously reported derivative KBPO4F, which crystallizes in a monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9) with a two-dimensional (2D)-layered structure. Careful structural analysis reveals that this structural transformation (from a monoclinic 2D structure to cubic 3D structures) should be aroused by the different alkaline ionic radii. To the best of our knowledge, such an abrupt structural transformation by alkaline elements is reported in all-inorganic asymmetric compounds for the first time. The structural transformation from 2D to 3D structures is favorable to eliminate the layered growth habit.

Results indicate that the mass density through the liquid-vapor interface decreases sharply when the evaporation is in the steady state. Meanwhile, there is an adsorption layer in the form of clusters at the solid-liquid interface, which has a higher mass density than the droplet inside. Furthermore, the wetting property of the solid substrate is related to the system's initial temperature and the solid-liquid potential energy parameter. The contact angle decreases with the increase of initial temperature and solid-liquid potential energy parameter. During the accelerated evaporation process, small part of energy transports into the liquid in the perpendicular direction to the solid-liquid interface and most of the energy transports along the parallel direction to the solid-liquid interface in the adsorption layer to the three-phase contact line. The heat-transfer process from the solid substrate to the droplet inside is hindered by the Kapitza resistance at the solid-liquid interface, no matter the solid substrate is hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Meanwhile, the Kapitza resistance gradually increases with the increase of the initial temperature and decreases with the increase of the solid-liquid energy parameter.","Chlotrichenes A and B, Two Lindenane Sesquiterpene Dimers with Highly Fused Carbon Skeletons from Chloranthus holostegius.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652878,Organic letters,2019 03 26,"Two unprecedented lindenane sesquiterpene dimers, chlotrichenes A (1) and B (2), were obtained from Chloranthus holostegius var. trichoneurus.

However, the clinical use of HNK in the treatment of insomnia is restricted by its extremely low oral bioavailability. In the present work, enhanced oral bioavailability of HNK was achieved by loading it into poly lactide-glycolide acid microparticles (HNK-MP). After oral administration, HNK-MP demonstrated 15-fold increase of AUC0-12 h in comparison to free HNK.

B,2019 04 15,"Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are a class of organic salts that are liquid at room temperature. Their physiochemical properties, including low vapor pressure and wide electrochemical stability window, have driven their use as electrolytes in many electrochemical applications; however, the slow transport properties of many RTILs have limited their utility in some applications. This issue is often mitigated by solvating ionic liquids in neutral organic solvents. To date, however, solvent interactions have only been explored for a small number of solvents, particularly acetonitrile and propylene carbonate, at only a few compositions. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations in the context of a computational screening approach to study mixtures of ionic liquids in many different solvents at a range of concentrations. Building on prior work, we again find that ionic liquid diffusivity increases monotonically with greater solvent concentration. In contrast to prior work, we find that pure solvent diffusivity, not polarity, is the most influential solvent property on mixture behavior. We also explore the concentration dependence of ionic conductivity and find maxima at intermediate concentrations. Experimental conductivity measurements, inspired by the computational screening study, support this observation with qualitatively consistent results. These results can further guide the selection of solvents for electrochemical applications of RTILs."

A potential solution involves measurement of NMR perturbations after site-specific paramagnetic labeling. Although the approach works well for proteins, the inability to place the label at specific sites has prevented its application to larger RNAs transcribed in vitro. Here, we present a strategy in which RNA loop residues are modified to promote binding to a paramagnetically tagged reporter protein. Lanthanide-induced pseudocontact shifts are demonstrated for a 232-nucleotide RNA bound to tagged derivatives of the spliceosomal U1A RNA-binding domain. Further, the method is validated with a 36-nucleotide RNA for which measured NMR values agreed with predictions based on the previously known protein and RNA structures. The ability to readily insert U1A binding sites into ubiquitous hairpin and/or loop structures should make this approach broadly applicable for the atomic-level study of large RNAs.","Potential Energy Surface of Group 11 Trimers (Cu, Ag, Au): Bond Angle Isomerism in Au3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652859,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 16,"Potential energy surfaces for the group 11 trimers were generated at various levels of coupled-cluster theory to examine the effects of Jahn-Teller distortions. Our calculations show that the lowest-energy conformer for Cu3, Ag3, and Au3 is the 2B2 (∼65° isomer) without spin-orbit corrections. Spin-orbit corrections have negligible contributions to the relative energies for the angle dependence of the potential energy surfaces for Cu3 and Ag3. The inclusion of spin-orbit corrections for Au3 makes the 2B2 (∼65°) and 2A1 (∼55°) states approximately degenerate. A novel 2B2 isomer of Au3 at an obtuse angle of ∼125° was also characterized, providing evidence for bond angle isomerism on the same 2B2 potential energy surface. Spin-orbit corrections increase the barrier height between the 2B2 (65°) and 2B2 (125°) bond angle isomers of Au3. The calculated symmetric stretch vibrational frequencies are in good agreement with the available experimental values. All frequencies calculated for the Au32B2 (∼125°) state are real, and there is at least one bound bending vibration for this state.

The prepared urease-encapsulated AuNCs (U-AuNCs) exhibited strong red fluorescence emission (λem = 630 nm) with a quantum yield as high as 17%. Interestingly, at a low concentration, the U-AuNC solution was found to be a dual-emissive system with the blue emission of the dityrosine (diTyr) residues of urease and the red emission of the embedded AuNCs. Further experiments demonstrated that p-nitrophenol (PNP) can selectively suppress the 410 nm emission of the diTyr residues of U-AuNCs without affecting the red emission of the U-AuNCs. The fluorescence quenching mechanism between U-AuNCs and PNP was systematically studied, and the leading role of the inner filter effect (IFE) was identified. Additionally, based on the sulfatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNPS) to release PNP, a self-referenced ratiometric detection method for sulfatase, which plays a crucial role in sulfur cycling, degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids, and extracellular remodeling of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, was developed by using dual-emissive U-AuNCs as the signal readout, in which the diTyr residues served as the probe and the AuNCs functioned as the internal reference. This IFE-based ratiometric sensing strategy showed a good linear relationship over the range of 0.01-1 U/mL ( R2 = 0.997). The detection limit for sulfatase activity was 0.01 U/mL. The developed protocol was successfully used to detect sulfatase activity in human serum samples.

We here demonstrate the simple and scalable fabrication of heterojunctions by a one-step synthesis process that yields photodetectors with superior device performance. Catalytic conversion of a solid precursor at optimized conditions was found to produce lateral nanostructured junctions between graphene domains and 3 nm thin amorphous carbon films. Carrier transport in these heterojunctions was found to proceed by minimizing the path through the amorphous carbon barriers, which results in a self-selective Schottky emission process with high uniformity and low emission barriers. We demonstrate the potential of thus produced heterojunctions by realizing a photodetector that combines an ultrahigh detectivity of 1013 Jones with microsecond response time, which represents the highest performance of 2D material heterojunction devices. These attractive features are retained even for millimeter-scale devices, and the demonstrated ability to produce transparent, patterned, and flexible sensors extends lateral heterojunction sensors toward wearable and large-scale electronics.",Vinyl Ethylene Carbonate as an Effective SEI-Forming Additive in Carbonate-Based Electrolyte for Lithium-Metal Anodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652854,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 26,"We report the use of vinyl ethylene carbonate as a new solid electrolyte interface (SEI)-forming additive for Li-metal anodes in carbonate-based electrolyte, which has the advantages of both good storage performance and low price.

The results demonstrate that the obtained NC gels present a highly interconnected network, where flexible PVA chains wrap onto the rigid TA@CNC motifs and form the dynamic TA@CNC-PVA clusters associated by hydrogen bonds, affording the critical mechanical toughness. The synergetic interactions between borate-diol bonds and hydrogen bonds impart a typical self-healing behavior into the NC gels, allowing the dynamic cross-linked networks to undergo fast rearrangement in the time scale of seconds.

Fluorometric molecular sensing systems generally report with a major emphasis on the merit of fluorescence analysis. What we are proposing within this report is a next-generation fluorescent probe that allows hydrazine to become fully traceable, within multifarious environments that show fast and intuitional fluorescence transformation. A new sensing moiety, ortho-methoxy-methyl-ether ( o-OMOM) incorporated electron donor (D)-acceptor (A) type naphthaldehyde provides high selectivity and sensitivity amidst its superiority within practical applications for sensing hydrazine.

They also belong to proteins that are collectively known as immunophilins. Cyclophilins are found in all cells of all organisms studied, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The first member of the cyclophilins to be identified in mammals, cyclophilin A, is the major cellular target for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. This review discusses recently available data about proteins with cyclophilin domain (CBD). Recent studies have implicated a diverse array of additional cellular functions for cyclophilins, including roles as chaperones and in cell signalling as well as in several human diseases.",[Membrane receptors recognizing MAMP/PAMP and DAMP molecules that activate first line of defence in plant immune system].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652835,Postepy biochemii,2019 03 23,"Plants have evolved a multilevel immune system to protect them against infection by a diverse range of pathogens. The first line of plant defense consists of the integral plasma membrane receptors, known as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize MAMP/PAMP or DAMP molecules. PRRs activate downstream signaling cascades that culminate in generation of the innate immune response, called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). The activation of PTI leads to the induction of basal defense responses, which include influx of Ca2+ in the cytosol, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, callose deposition, stomatal closure, phytoalexins biosynthesis, defence hormone biosynthesis and transcriptional induction of a large suite of defence-related genes.",[Transgenic mice as models to study the influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids on metabolism].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652834,Postepy biochemii,2019 03 23,"The mouse is a popular animal model employed for studying metabolic alterations. The generation of fat-1 transgenic mice by Professor Jing X. Kang and collaborators has revolutionised the omega-3 research. Fat-1 mice are able to convert omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids due to gene fat-1 from Caenorhabditis elegans that encodes an omega-3 fatty acids desaturase. This mice model can endogenously synthesize omega-3 PUFA without ALA intake and the balancing quantity and quality of various confounding factors of different diets. Next, novel transgenic mice - ""Omega mice"" with the expression of the fat-1 and fat-2 transgenes were created to produce both omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA from a diet containing saturated fat or carbohydrates with essential fatty acids deficiency. Both transgenic mice are utilities for studying molecular mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids and their metabolites in tumorigenesis and inflammatory disorders.",[Genetic engineering as a method for the improvement of photosynthesis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652833,Postepy biochemii,2019 03 23,"The significant increase in crop productivity occurred in the second half o the 20th century. However, it is thought that nowadays yield of main crop species reached its maximum. As we expect that the demand for plant products is going to increase during next century, it is necessary to develop new methods for yield improvement, other than traditional breeding. The redesign of photosynthesis using genetic engineering is one of the approaches postulated. The present article covers the main directions of research aimed to increase photosynthetic efficiency. The research covered by this review are: improvement of light capture, improvement of Rubisco and the regeneration phase of Calvin cycle, introducing carbon concentrating mechanisms to main crop species and reducing loss caused by photorespiration.",[Gene editing].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652832,Postepy biochemii,2019 03 23,"Development of the gene engineering techniques has raised worries that they will be used for construction of organism endangering humans and environment. In 1975 at the Asilomar conference, geneticists from many countries decided that genetic engineering brings more benefits than threats. In last years a new CRISPR-Cas technique emerged . It allows to make the precise changes in genomes, e.g. to inactivate particular genes or to replace mutated genes by their wild-type alleles. Inactivation in mice of genes corresponding to those whose mutations cause the genetic diseases in man allows to get model organisms for studying the etiology of given disease and for working out the methods of its curing. This technique can be applied for repairing genes whose mutations result in metabolic diseases and cancer. Some voices were raised that the technique can be potentially used for the ""improvement"" of man, what would create many ethical and social problems. Geneticists, ethicists and lawyers gathered in 2015 at the Washington conference, discussed these problems and proposed rules for their solving.",[50th anniversary of discovering „magic spots” – the latest advances in (p)ppGpp research].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652831,Postepy biochemii,2019 03 23,"About 50 years ago, ""magic spots"" - mediators of the bacterial stringent response, were discovered and were later identified as guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate (ppGpp and pppGpp, jointly referred to as (p)ppGpp). At first, it seemed that stringent response is associated only with bacterial response to amino acid starvation, however, it soon turned out that (p)ppGpp is synthesized in response to other stresses as well. The mentioned alarmones are found to exist in all known bacterial species, as well as in plants. In recent years, a significant progress has been made in research on (p)ppGpp metabolism. It is also known that the stringent response affects many cellular processes, among which its effect on transcription is the best characterized. Moreover, (p)ppGpp is involved in the DNA repair pathway associated with transcription. In addition, the stringent response inhibits cell division, mainly by hindering DNA replication. (p)ppGpp is also of significant medical importance - it is necessary for virulence of many bacterial species and for turning them into persisters, i.e. cells which have elevated tolerance to many antibiotics.",Depression Increases the Risk of Death Independently From Vascular Events in Elderly Individuals: The Three-City Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652829,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2019 03 06,"How much the association between depressive symptoms (DSs) and all-cause mortality depends on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events is poorly known.

A total of 300 OA patients and 300 controls were recruited and their genotypes for ADAMTS5 gene rs226794 and rs2830585 polymorphisms were determined using a custom-by-design 48-Plex single nucleotide polymorphism Scan™ kit. ADAMTS5-associated genes were identified by co-expression analysis and their functions were investigated by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. Bioinformatics analysis showed that ADAMTS5 was significantly related to the components, structural constituent, and organization of the extracellular matrix. The rs2830585 polymorphism, but not rs226794 polymorphism, was significantly associated with an increased risk of knee OA. Stratified analysis further confirmed this significant association in patients at age ≥55 years. In conclusion, the ADAMTS5 rs2830585 polymorphism may be involved in the development of knee OA by destroying the extracellular matrix, but this finding should be further confirmed by larger studies."

However, the thermal conductivity (κ) of TIMs is significantly smaller than the intrinsic κ of fillers due to the large interfacial thermal contact resistance between fillers. Here we achieve a very efficient thermal percolation network of flower-shaped silver nanoparticles (silver nanoflowers, Ag NFs) in soft polyurethane (PU) matrix TIMs. A record high κ (42.4 W m-1 K-1) is achieved compared with soft isotropic TIMs in the literature. Ag nanoflake-PU and Ag nanosphere-PU TIMs provide significantly smaller κ (7.9 and 15.0 W m-1 K-1) at an identical filler concentration (38 vol%). Surprisingly, the phonon transport of the Ag NF-PU TIM dramatically increases (κlat = 22.2 W m-1 K-1) compared with Ag nanoflake-PU and Ag nanosphere-PU (κlat = 0.2 and 1.2 W m-1 K-1) TIMs. Kinetic theory reveals that the phonon mean free path (39.6 nm) is significantly increased for the Ag NF-PU TIM by the active coalescence of metallic Ag NFs.

How consumer expectations and addition of vegetable pieces to soups influence sensory perception and liking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652709,Food & function,2019 06 04,"This study investigated the effect of mechanical contrast and particle flavour concentration of carrot particles added to soups on expected and perceived sensations and liking. The properties of a chicken soup were varied by addition of real carrots, model carrots and model chicken particles differing in size, fracture stress, and/or carrot flavour concentration. The four aims of the study were: (1) To study the effect of mechanical contrast on expected and perceived sensations; (2) To investigate the role of particle carrot flavour concentration on perceived sensations and liking; (3) To study the effect of dis/confirmation of expected by perceived sensations on liking; (4) To investigate the consumer's preferences and ideal profile of soups. Expected sensory properties were affected by particle size: the larger the particles, the higher the expected intensities for hardness, chewiness, and crunchiness of soups. Perceived sensory properties were significantly influenced by size and fracture stress of carrot particles. Increasing flavour concentration in model carrot particles added to soups marginally influenced liking suggesting that flavour concentration in particles added to soups has a limited effect on liking. When model carrot particles were added to soups, expected sensory properties were confirmed by perceived sensory properties, and consequently liking did not change considerably. The congruency and familiar appearance of the model carrot pieces probably contributed to the confirmation of expectations. When model chicken pieces were added to soups, expected sensory properties were disconfirmed by perceived sensory properties leading to a significant decrease in liking. Soups containing medium-sized, soft carrot particles were the closest to the consumer's ideal product profile. To summarize, consumer expectations and physicochemical properties of chicken and carrot particles added to chicken soup contributed to perception and liking of soups. We conclude that the sensory product profile of common products such as soups can be optimised by addition of congruent and familiar particles that match consumer' expectations.",Unusual interfacial magnetic interactions for τ-MnAl with Fe(Co) atomic layers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652708,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"The interfacial magnetic interaction and coupling mechanism for τ-MnAl with Fe(Co) atomic layers have been studied using first principles calculations. The stable surface and interface were firstly determined by the surface energy of τ-MnAl and interface energy of τ-MnAl/Fe(Co) films, respectively. Their magnetic coupling interactions were investigated by varying the Fe(Co) atomic layer numbers. It is noted that both Fe and Co exhibited ferromagnetic coupling with τ-MnAl. Interestingly, an unusual oscillation phenomenon of magnetic coupling for τ-MnAl with Fe(Co) atomic layers was observed depending on the layer thickness of Fe(Co). Moreover, Fe and Co showed different oscillation modes. The energy difference between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states is larger for τ-MnAl/Fe and τ-MnAl/Co when the Fe(Co) layer numbers are even and odd, respectively. Their mechanisms were analyzed based on the band structures and the confinement of electrons in quantum wells. It is found that the magnetic coupling oscillation in τ-MnAl/Fe originated from both the spin up Δ1 band and spin down Δ5 band at the [capital Gamma, Greek, macron] points. Comparatively, the oscillation of τ-MnAl/Co is due to the spin up band at the X[combining macron] point.

The diffusion of the motor, its efficiency and its elementary displacement strongly depend on the characteristic time of the folding, but only slightly on the temperature. The increase of the motor's efficiency when the folding characteristic time τ decreases agrees with the fluctuation theorem expectation as the entropy generated inside the medium increases. The constant efficiency with respect to temperature is more difficult to understand as it suggests a generated entropy independent of temperature. In contrast with these results, the diffusion of the medium induced by the motor's folding strongly depends on the temperature, but doesn't depend on the characteristic time of the folding. That result suggests that the medium's diffusion is not due to the motor's displacement. We find that cooperative motions known as dynamic heterogeneity depend significantly on both temperature and folding time, leading in some conditions to a decoupling between dynamic heterogeneity and the medium's diffusion. Eventually, we find that the cooperative motions induced by the folding are larger when the motor cannot move.",Modulating the expression of chirality in a mechanically chiral rotaxane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652699,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 15,"The expression of mechanical chirality by a hydrogen bond templated rotaxane, as detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy, may be modulated by affecting the co-conformational behaviour of the rotaxane through varying solvent or by addition of acid and base.",Computational studies of protein-protein dissociation by statistical potential and coarse-grained simulations: a case study on interactions between colicin E9 endonuclease and immunity proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652698,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 10,"Proteins carry out their diverse functions in cells by forming interactions with each other. The dynamics of these interactions are quantified by the measurement of association and dissociation rate constants. Relative to the efforts made to model the association of biomolecules, little has been studied to understand the principles of protein complex dissociation. Using the interaction between colicin E9 endonucleases and immunity proteins as a test system, here we develop a coarse-grained simulation method to explore the dissociation mechanisms of protein complexes. The interactions between proteins in the complex are described by the knowledge-based potential that was constructed by the statistics from available protein complexes in the structural database. Our study provides the supportive evidences to the dual recognition mechanism for the specificity of binding between E9 DNase and immunity proteins, in which the conserved residues of helix III of Im2 and Im9 proteins act as the anchor for binding, while the sequence variations in helix II make positive or negative contributions to specificity. Beyond that, we further suggest that this binding specificity is rooted in the process of complex dissociation instead of association. While we increased the flexibility of protein complexes, we further found that they are less prone to dissociation, suggesting that conformational fluctuations of protein complexes play important functional roles in regulating their binding and dissociation. Our studies therefore bring new insights to the molecule mechanisms of protein-protein interactions, while the method can serve as a new addition to a suite of existing computational tools for the simulations of protein complexes.",Thiourea participation in [3+2] cycloaddition with donor-acceptor cyclopropanes: a domino process to 2-amino-dihydrothiophenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652697,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 15,"The Yb(OTf)3-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes with thiourea offers an efficient route to diverse 2-amino-4,5-dihydrothiophenes (up to 92% yield), in which optically active 2-amino-dihydrothiophenes can be produced from enantiomerically pure cyclopropanes.

The ternary composite was prepared by depositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) covered TiO2 nanobeads (TiONBs). MoS2 nanosheet modified TiONBs provided a large surface area for immobilization of AuNPs and biomolecules. The ternary composite also possesses an improved electron transfer and catalytic capability. To construct the aptasensor, thiolated MC-LR aptamers were immobilized on the AuNP@MoS2-TiONB modified electrode through a gold-sulfur bond. Then, biotin-cDNA with a sequence complementary to the MC-LR aptamer competed with MC-LR for binding to the immobilized aptamer. The current signal catalyzed by avidin-HRP decreased with the increase of MC-LR, based on which a linear range of 0.005-30 nM and a detection limit of 0.002 nM were obtained."

Using a broad database search approach, we reviewed the literature on CCHF and CCHFV in Southern and Western Asia to better define the disease burden in these areas. We used a One Health approach, moving beyond a focus solely on human disease burden to more comprehensively define this burden by reviewing CCHF case reports, human and animal CCHFV seroprevalence studies, and human and animal CCHFV isolations. In addition, we used published literature to estimate the distribution of Hyalomma ticks and infection of these ticks by CCHFV. Using these data, we propose a new classification scheme for organizing the evaluated countries into five categories by level of evidence for CCHF endemicity. Twelve countries have reported CCHF cases, five from Southern Asia and seven from Western Asia. These were assigned to level 1 or 2. Eleven countries that have evidence of vector circulation but did not report confirmed CCHF cases were assigned to level 3 or 4. This classification scheme was developed to inform policy toward strengthening CCHF disease surveillance in the Southern and Western Asia regions. In particular, the goal of this review was to inform international organizations, local governments, and health-care professionals about current shortcomings in CCHFV surveillance in these two high-prevalence regions.",Clinical Indicators of Fatal Dengue in Two Endemic Areas of Colombia: A Hospital-Based Case-Control Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652671,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 02 14,"According to the World Health Organization, 98% of fatal dengue cases can be prevented; however, endemic countries such as Colombia have recorded higher case fatality rates during recent epidemics. We aimed to identify the predictors of mortality that allow risk stratification and timely intervention in patients with dengue. We conducted a hospital-based, case-control (1:2) study in two endemic areas of Colombia (2009-2015). Fatal cases were defined as having either 1) positive serological test (IgM or NS1), 2) positive virological test (RT-PCR or viral isolation), or 3) autopsy findings compatible with death from dengue. Controls (matched by state and year) were hospitalized nonfatal patients and had a positive serological or virological dengue test. Exposure data were extracted from medical records by trained staff. We used conditional logistic regression (adjusting for age, gender, disease's duration, and health-care provider) in the context of multiple imputation to estimate exposure to case-control associations. We evaluated 110 cases and 217 controls (mean age: 35.0 versus 18.9; disease's duration pre-admission: 4.9 versus 5.0 days). In multivariable analysis, retro-ocular pain (odds ratios [OR] = 0.23), nausea (OR = 0.29), and diarrhea (OR = 0.19) were less prevalent among fatal than nonfatal cases, whereas increased age (OR = 2.46 per 10 years), respiratory distress (OR = 16.3), impaired consciousness (OR = 15.9), jaundice (OR = 32.2), and increased heart rate (OR = 2.01 per 10 beats per minute) increased the likelihood of death (AUC: 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 0.99).

Porcine cysticercosis is traditionally detected via tongue palpation and slaughterhouse meat inspection, both with limited sensitivity. Serum antibody detection has a better performance; however, it does not discriminate past from present infection. Serum antigen detection can demonstrate viable infection and gives a good estimate of parasitic load. This study evaluated a sandwich antigen-detection ELISA using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) 158C11 and 60H8 for the diagnosis of viable cysticercosis in pigs. Serum samples were used from 35 naturally T. solium cysticerci-infected pigs, 31 cysticercosis-negative pigs, and 22 pigs with Taenia hydatigena infection (to assess cross-reactions). Positive cysticercosis samples were subcategorized at necropsy according to parasitic burden as mild (1-10 viable cysts, n = 10), moderate (11-100 cysts, n = 5), or severe infection (more than 100 cysts, n = 20). This Ag-ELISA showed a sensitivity of 82.9% and a specificity of 96.8% when not considering cross-reactions with T. hydatigena. Hundred percentage of severely infected, 80% of moderately infected, and 50% of mildly T. solium-infected pigs tested positive. Twenty of 22 pigs with only T. hydatigena infections were positive, with 13 reaching saturating levels in the ELISA. The Ag-ELISA revealed the presence of live cysts and is, thus, a fairly reliable test to monitor experimental infection, response to treatment, and follow-up in animal models of cysticercosis. It should, however, be carefully interpreted when used in regions where T. hydatigena is endemic in pigs."

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy has great potential to modulate inflammatory responses and enhance tissue regeneration. We previously showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-preconditioned MSCs or genetically modified inflammation-sensing (driven by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells [NFκB] activation) IL4-secreting MSCs enhanced immunomodulation of macrophages to the more desired tissue repaired M2 type. In the current study, the paracrine regulation of therapeutic MSCs on the proinflammatory response and osteogenesis of macrophage-MSC cocultures (representing endogenous cells) was examined using an in vitro transwell system. In the cocultures, IL4-secreting MSCs decreased TNFα and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and increased Arginase 1 and CD206 expression in the presence of LPS-contaminated polyethylene particles. The preconditioned MSCs decreased TNFα and CD206 expression in the bottom MSC-macrophage cocultures in the presence of contaminated particles.

Hispanics' later population growth, by contrast, coincided with Church leaders' emphasis on integrated, territorial parishes. This paper examines more recent practice around personal parishes with explicit, named service to Hispanic Catholics. One in six new personal parishes serves Hispanics. Hispanic personal parishes' minimal presence among American dioceses, however, does not mirror Hispanics' larger presence among Catholics overall. Findings from an original National Study of Personal Parishes reveal commonalities in diocesan explanations for establishing - or not establishing - Hispanic personal parishes.

Research on non-Catholic congregations suggests positives and negatives for members in multi-racial settings, but sources of multi-racial Catholic parish formation are distinct enough to suggest different possible outcomes. We use data from the National Study of Catholic Parishes with Hispanic Ministry (Ospino, 2015) to assess the integration of various Hispanic sub-groups within parishes. We distinguish parishes by time period in which they began serving Hispanics and highlight the relative success of veteran parishes (those who began Spanish-language ministry prior to 1980). Importantly, veteran parishes are more likely to consistently celebrate bilingual liturgies and to be disproportionately composed of Latinos. Both factors help explain veteran parishes' greater success in integrating immigrant Latinos.",The value and need for new research on the U.S. Hispanic Catholic experience to build a stronger sense of communal belonging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652622,Journal of prevention & intervention in the community,2019 01 17,"Social scientific research on Catholic parishes serving Hispanic Catholics has not kept up with the fast growth of these communities in the United States, which constitute about a full quarter of Catholic communities in the country.

Clinicians face time constraints and communication challenges, which can further hamper the SDM process. In this article, we review patient decision aids (PDAs) as a means of supporting SDM by presenting clinical information and risk data to patients in a format that is accessible and easy to understand. We outline the benefits and limitations of PDAs as well as the challenges in their development, such as a lengthy and complex development process and implementation obstacles. Lastly, we discuss future trends and how change on multiple levels-PDA developers, clinicians, hospital administrators, and health care insurers-can support the use of PDAs and consequently SDM.

The project's history, operational structure, lessons learned, and institutional perspectives on participation in the data-sharing consortium are reviewed. Individuals involved with the inception and execution of AACR Project GENIE from each member institution described their experiences and lessons learned. The consortium was conceived in January 2014 and publicly released its first data set in January 2017, which consisted of 18,804 samples from 18,324 patients contributed by the eight founding institutions. Commitment and contributions from many individuals at AACR and the member institutions were crucial to the consortium's success. These individuals filled leadership, project management, informatics, data curation, contracts, ethics, and security roles. Many lessons were learned during the first 3 years of the consortium, including on how to gather, harmonize, and share data; how to make decisions and foster collaboration; and how to set the stage for continued participation and expansion of the consortium. We hope that the lessons shared here will assist new GENIE members as well as others who embark on the journey of forming a genomic data-sharing consortium.",Using a Federated Network of Real-World Data to Optimize Clinical Trials Operations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652541,JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 01 28,"Clinical trials, whether industry, cooperative group sponsored, or investigator initiated, have an unacceptable rate of failure as a result of the inability to recruit sufficient numbers of patients. Even those trials that are completed often require time-consuming protocol amendments to achieve accrual goals. These inefficiencies in clinical trial research result in increasing costs and prolong the time needed to bring improved treatments to cancer clinical practice. TriNetX has developed a clinical research collaboration platform-deployed by a federated network of health care organizations (HCOs), pharmaceutical firms (Pharma), and contract research organizations (CROs)-to enable data-driven clinical research study design to reduce accrual failure and protocol amendment. Currently, the network extends to 55 HCOs and covers 84 million patients, mostly within the United States, but with a growing international presence. (Many of the HCOs in United States are Clinical and Translational Science Awardees and/or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers.) The TriNetX business model includes Pharma and the CROs as sponsors whose subscriptions financially support the network, including the software and hardware costs of the HCOs. Furthermore, as each HCO network member has their data harmonized with the TriNetX model upon joining, data sharing among them does not require any technical processes to establish connectivity. To date, on the basis of the data on the network, HCOs have been presented approximately 757 studies by Pharma and CROs, and four data-sharing subnetworks have been formed among member HCOs.","CancerLinQ: Origins, Implementation, and Future Directions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652539,JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 01 28,"Rapid-learning health systems have been proposed as a potential solution to the problem of quality in medicine, by leveraging data generated from electronic health systems in near-real time to improve quality and reduce cost. Given the complex, dynamic nature of cancer care, a rapid-learning health system offers large potential benefits to oncology practice. In this article, we review the rationale for developing a rapid-learning health system for oncology and describe the sequence of events that led to the development of ASCO's CancerLinQ (Cancer Learning Intelligence Network for Quality) initiative, as well as the current state of CancerLinQ, including its importance to efforts such as the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. We then review the considerable challenges facing optimal implementation of a rapid-learning health system such as CancerLinQ, including integration of rapidly expanding multiomic data, capturing big data from a variety of sources, an evolving competitive landscape, and implementing a rapid-learning health system in a way that satisfies many stakeholders, including patients, providers, researchers, and administrators.",Incorporating Digital Tools to Improve Clinical Trial Infrastructure: A White Paper From the Digital Engagement Committee of SWOG.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652537,JCO clinical cancer informatics,2019 01 28,"Progress toward improvement in cancer therapy relies on clinical trials. Yet, only a minority of eligible patients with cancer enroll as a result of multiple barriers at the patient, investigator, center, and national level.

Health IT interventions should be designed with the end user in mind and be specific to the needs of a given population. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), commonly referred to as blood and marrow transplantation (BMT), is a prime example of a complex medical procedure where patient-caregiver-provider engagement is central to a safe and successful outcome. We have previously reported on the design and development of an HCT-specific health IT tool, BMT Roadmap.","Negative allosteric modulators of cannabinoid receptor 2: protein modeling, binding site identification and molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of an orthosteric agonist.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652534,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 04 09,"Selective activation of the cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) shows promise for treating pain, inflammation, multiple sclerosis, cancer, ischemic/reperfusion injury and osteoporosis. Target selectivity and off-target side effects are two major limiting factors for orthosteric ligands, and therefore, the search for allosteric modulators (AMs) is a widely used drug discovery approach. To date, only a limited number of negative CB2 AMs have been identified, possessing only micromolar activity at best, and the CB2 receptor's allosteric site(s) are not well characterized. Herein, we used computational approaches including receptor modeling, site mapping, docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations to predict, characterize and validate allosteric sites within the complex of the CB2 receptor with bound orthosteric agonist CP55,940. After docking of known negative CB2 allosteric modulators (NAMs), dihydro-gambogic acid (DHGA) and trans-β-caryophyllene (TBC) (note that TBC also shows agonist activity), at the predicted allosteric sites, the best total complex with CB2, CP55,940 and NAM was embedded into a hydrated lipid bilayer and subjected to a 200 ns MD simulation. The presence of an AM affected the CB2-CP55,940 complex, altering the relative positioning of the toggle switch residues and promoting a strong π-π interaction between Phe1173.36 and Trp2586.48. Binding of either TBC or DHGA to a putative allosteric pocket directly adjacent to the orthosteric ligand reduced the binding free energy of CP55,940, which is consistent with the expected effect of a negative AM. The identified allosteric sites present immense scope for the discovery of novel classes of CB2 AMs.",Screening of native tropical trees for phytoremediation in copper-polluted soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652533,International journal of phytoremediation,2019 02 01,"Due to the limited number of studies on phytoremediation using native tree species in tropical soils, the aim was to identify new phytoremediator species from tropical climate with the purpose of promoting an increase in the diversity of tropical native trees used in phytoremediation projects. Seven native tree species from Brazil were selected: Cedrela fissilis, Handroanthus serratifolius, Copaifera langsdorffii, Hymenaea courbaril, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Cecropia sp. and Myracrodruon urundeuva. Seedlings of these species were planted in pots with an unpolluted Arenosol, and then spiked with 60, 100 and 500 mg kg-1 Cu. Height and stem diameters were measured over 60 days. Biomass and total Cu concentration were determined in leaves, stem and roots. Copper in bulk soils and rhizospheres was analyzed by a sequential extraction method. All species accumulated high concentration of Cu in roots (>300 mg kg-1), so they could be used as phytostabilizators for this metal. Copper mobilization increased in the rhizospheres, but it was mostly absorbed by roots. Cecropia sp., M. urundeuva and C. langsdorffii are hyperaccumulators of Cu (>300 mg kg-1 in shoots), so they are potential phytoextractor species. This study evidence the potential of seven tree species native from tropical regions for phytostabilizing copper-polluted soils.",Elevated serum ferritin level as a predictor of reduced survival in patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in China: a retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652532,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2019 06 06,"Objective: The objective of this study was to compare iron metabolic variables in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) with those of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and control subjects. We also assessed the correlations of these variables with sALS progression and severity and estimated their roles in predicting prognosis. Methods: We retrospectively collected iron metabolic parameters, including serum levels of iron, ferritin, transferrin levels and total iron binding capacity and the CSF level of ferritin, from 435 sALS patients, 176 MSA patients and 431 control subjects. Results: Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in the sALS group compared with the MSA and control groups in both males (p = 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and females (p = 0.034 and p < 0.0001, respectively). However, serum transferrin levels were significantly lower in females of the sALS group compared with the MSA (p = 0.016) and control (p = 0.015) groups. The CSF ferritin level and the serum levels of total iron binding capacity and iron were similar among the sALS, MSA and control groups. Survival analysis demonstrated that higher serum ferritin levels were predictors of reduced survival of sALS patients. No correlations between iron metabolic variables and clinical parameters were found. Conclusion: An elevated serum ferritin level is associated with reduced survival of sALS patients. However, the levels of iron metabolic parameters were not associated with clinical deterioration or disease severity at diagnosis.",Metal bashing: iron deficiency and manganese overexposure impact on peripheral nerves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652531,Journal of toxicology and environmental health. Part A,2019 03 05,"Iron (Fe) deficiency (FeD) and manganese (Mn) overexposure (MnOE) may result in several neurological alterations in the nervous system. Iron deficiency produces unique neurological deficits due to its elemental role in central nervous system (CNS) development and myelination, which might persist after normalization of Fe in the diet. Conversely, MnOE is associated with diverse neurocognitive deficits. Despite these well-known neurotoxic effects on the CNS, the influence of FeD and MnOE on the peripheral nervous system (PNS) remains poorly understood. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the effects of developmental FeD and MnOE or their combination on the sciatic nerve of young and adult rats. The parameters measured included divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), transferrin receptor (TfR), myelin basic protein (MBP) and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) expression, as well as Fe levels in the nerve. Our results showed that FeD produced a significant reduction in MBP and PMP22 content at P29, which persisted at P60 after Fe-sufficient diet replenishment regardless of Mn exposure levels. At P60 MnOE significantly increased sciatic nerve Fe content and DMT1 expression. However, the combination of FeD and MnOE produced no marked motor skill impairment. Evidence indicates that FeD appears to hinder developmental peripheral myelination, while MnOE may directly alter Fe homeostasis. Further studies are required to elucidate the interplay between these pathological conditions."

Early onset Marfan syndrome is associated with high mortality rates, usually within the first 2 years of life. First, we present a case of prenatally diagnosed early onset Marfan syndrome in a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy, where suspicion was raised at 35 weeks of gestation. Ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess prenatal findings in the affected fetus. She presented right diaphragmatic eventration, elongation of humerus and femur and subluxation of the crystalline lens. She died 3 months after birth. Secondly, we present a PubMed-based review of the published articles on early onset Marfan syndrome, with pre- or postnatal suspicion or diagnosis. We found 39 articles published between 1981 and 2017, arising information on 55 cases. Including ours, early onset Marfan syndrome was prenatally diagnosed in 34.54% of the cases. In these cases, the most frequent prenatal findings were cardiomegaly, dilatation of the great vessels and mitral or tricuspid regurgitation. Mortality rate during the first 15 months after birth was 73.68%. In the postnatally diagnosed cases, the most frequent findings were arachnodactyly, dilatation of the great vessels and mitral or tricuspid regurgitation. Mortality rate was 61.11%. Overall genetic confirmation was performed in 67.27% of the cases. Prenatal diagnosis of early onset Marfan syndrome is challenging but of utmost importance, since management should take place in a tertiary care center, by a multidisciplinary team.

Factors related to the sociodemographic, economic, personal, environmental, and healthy life indicators influencing tobacco consumption in Turkey were determined using logistic and probit regression analyses. According to the results of the study, age, gender, education, marital status, fruit consumption, exposure to tobacco smoke at home, and frequent of alcohol consumption are the most influential variables effecting tobacco consumption. More effective results in policies aimed at preventing tobacco consumption can be accomplished by giving priority to individuals more inclined to tobacco consumption.

With the currently available combinations of dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, median progression-free survival (PFS) of over 12 months has been achieved. However, treatment resistance and disease recurrence remain a clinical challenge. Areas covered: Encorafenib in combination with bimetinib offers a new approach that may offer benefits over existing BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations. Expert opinion: While other BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations have achieved a median overall survival (OS) of 22 months, patients with advanced BRAF mutation-positive melanoma treated with encorafenib plus binimetinib achieved a median OS of 33.6 months in the phase III COLUMBUS trial. PFS also appears to be improved with encorafenib plus binimetinib. This improved efficacy may be related to the distinct pharmacokinetics of encorafenib, with prolonged binding to the target molecule providing greater BRAF inhibition and increased potency compared with other drugs in the same class. Increased specificity of encorafenib may also result in better tolerability with less off-target effects, including reduced occurrence of pyrexia and photosensitivity. Encorafenib plus binimetinib seems likely to emerge as a valuable therapeutic alternative to established BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations.",Dual cross-linked chitosan microspheres formulated with spray-drying technique for the sustained release of levofloxacin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652515,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,2019 06 14,This study was aimed to develop sustained drug release from levofloxacin (LF)-loaded chitosan (CS) microspheres for treating ophthalmic infections.,"The Crotalaria juncea metal transporter CjNRAMP1 has a high Fe uptake activity, even in an environment with high Cd contamination.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652514,International journal of phytoremediation,2019 02 01,"Large quantities of Fe and Cd accumulate in the leaves of the metal-accumulating leguminous plant, Crotalaria juncea. A member of the metal transporter NRAMP family was cloned from C. juncea. The amino acid sequence of this clone, designated CjNRAMP1, was similar to the sequence of Arabidopsis AtNRAMP1, which is involved in Fe and Cd transport. Organ-specific analysis showed that CjNRAMP1 mRNA was expressed mainly in the leaves of C. juncea plants, as well as in stems and roots. Use of green fluorescent protein fused to CjNRAMP1 suggested its localization to the plasma membranes of plant cells. Complementation experiments using yeast strains with impaired metal transport systems showed that CjNRAMP1 transported both Fe and Cd in an inward direction within the cells. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CjNRAMP1 showed high tolerance to Cd, with Cd translocation from roots to leaves being substantially greater in transgenic than in wild-type plants. Overexpression of CjNRAMP1 resulted in a greater accumulation of Fe in shoots and roots, suggesting that CjNRAMP1 recognizes Fe and Cd as substrates and that the high Cd tolerance of CjNRAMP1 is due to its strong Fe uptake activity, even in the presence of high Cd concentrations in the rhizosphere.",Characteristics of impaired voluntary cough function in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652513,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2019 05 15,"Although cough impairment (dystussia) is common in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and contributes to a reduced physiologic capacity to defend the airway, characteristics of dystussia have not yet been delineated.

It considered four grass species, namely, guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus), spear grass (Imperata cylindrica), gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), and elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum). The treatments involved growing each of the four grasses on a mixture of 3:1 soil/drill-cuttings ratio, after failed trials with mix ratios ranging from 1:3 to 2:1 soil/drill-cuttings ratio, and on uncontaminated soil. The TPH concentration dropped by 27-81% from 4805 mg kg-1 in the 3:1 soil/drill-cuttings mixtures in the different treatments after 12 weeks. Better growth performance in the contaminated treatments, compared to uncontaminated controls, correlated with higher reduction in TPH and metals concentrations. The contaminated elephant grass treatment showed better plant height and leaf sizes than the uncontaminated control. The growth parameters of contaminated treatments with the other three grasses ranged from 29 to 75% of the corresponding uncontaminated controls. The results demonstrate that the relative suitability of the grasses for land farming of oil-based drill cuttings is in the order, elephant grass > guinea grass > gamba grass > spear grass.",Association of mindfulness and stress with menopausal symptoms in midlife women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652511,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2019 06 03,"Purpose: Midlife women frequently experience stress and menopausal symptoms. Mindfulness is thought to mitigate stress by avoiding emotional reactivity and ruminative thinking. We sought to assess the association of mindfulness and stress on menopausal symptoms among midlife women. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, women aged 40-65 years completed questionnaires, including the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4), and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Linear regression was used to assess the impact of mindfulness and stress on menopausal symptoms with use of univariate and multivariable analyses, adjusting for patient characteristics. Results: In this cohort of 1744 midlife women, higher mindfulness (MAAS) and lower stress (PSS-4) scores correlated independently with lower menopausal symptom (MRS) scores. On multivariable analysis, a significant interaction effect was observed between the MAAS and PSS-4 on the MRS, such that with higher PSS-4 scores, the magnitude of association between the MAAS and lower MRS scores was larger. Conclusion: Among midlife women, higher mindfulness and lower stress correlated with lower menopausal symptom scores independently.

Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 03 04,"Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway using statins has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). Here, we investigated whether partial inhibition of this pathway by targeting geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase large subunit 1 (GGPPS1), a catalase downstream of the mevalonate pathway, was effective at treating lung inflammation in ALI. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intratracheally instilled to induce ALI in lung-specific GGPPS1-knockout and wild-type mice. Expression of GGPPS1 in lung tissues and alveolar epithelial cells was examined. The severity of lung injury and inflammation was determined in lung-specific GGPPS1 knockout and wild-type mice by measuring alveolar exudate, neutrophil infiltration, lung injury, and cell death. Change in global gene expression in response to GGPPS1 depletion was measured using mRNA microarray and verified in vivo and in vitro. We found that GGPPS1 levels increased significantly in lung tissues and alveolar epithelial cells in LPS-induced ALI mice. Compared with wild-type and simvastatin treated mice, the specific deletion of pulmonary GGPPS1 attenuated the severity of lung injury by inhibiting apoptosis of AECs. Furthermore, deletion of GGPPS1 inhibited LPS-induced inflammasome activation, in terms of IL-1β release and pyroptosis, by downregulating NLRP3 expression. Finally, downregulation of GGPPS1 reduced the membrane expression of Ras-related protein Rab10 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inhibited the phosphonation of IκB. This effect might be attributed to the downregulation of GGPP levels. Our results suggested that inhibition of pulmonary GGPPS1 attenuated LPS-induced ALI predominantly by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome through Rab10-mediated TLR4 replenishment.",Acute and chronic changes in the control of breathing in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652496,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 04 16,"Infants born very prematurely (<28 wk gestation) have immature lungs and often require supplemental oxygen. However, long-term hyperoxia exposure can arrest lung development, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which increases acute and long-term respiratory morbidity and mortality. The neural mechanisms controlling breathing are highly plastic during development. Whether the ventilatory control system adapts to pulmonary disease associated with hyperoxia exposure in infancy remains unclear. Here, we assessed potential age-dependent adaptations in the control of breathing in an established rat model of BPD associated with hyperoxia. Hyperoxia exposure (

Perinatal hyperoxia led to greater glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and an increase in neuron counts within six of eight or one of eight key brainstem regions, respectively, controlling breathing, suggesting astrocytic expansion. In conclusion, perinatal hyperoxia in rats induced a BPD-like phenotype and age-dependent adaptations in V̇e that may be mediated through changes to the neural architecture of the ventilatory control system. Our results suggest chronically altered ventilatory control in BPD.",Metagenomic comparison of tracheal aspirate and mini-bronchial alveolar lavage for assessment of respiratory microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652494,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 06 14,"Accurate and informative microbiological testing is essential for guiding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in patients who are critically ill. Sampling of tracheal aspirate (TA) is less invasive compared with mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mBAL) and is now recommended as a frontline diagnostic approach in patients who are mechanically ventilated, despite the historical belief that TA was suboptimal due to contamination from oral microbes. Advancements in metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) now permit assessment of airway microbiota without a need for culture and, as such, provide an opportunity to examine differences between mBAL and TA at a resolution previously unachievable. Here, we engaged shotgun mNGS to assess quantitatively the airway microbiome in matched mBAL and TA specimens from a prospective cohort of critically ill adults. We observed moderate differences between sample types across all subjects; however, we found significant compositional similarity in subjects with bacterial pneumonia, whose microbial communities were characterized by dominant pathogens. In contrast, in patients with noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses, significant differences were observed between sample types. Our findings suggest that TA sampling provides a similar assessment of airway microbiota as more invasive testing by mBAL in patients with pneumonia.",Three classical papers in respiratory physiology by Christian Bohr (1855-1911) whose work is frequently cited but seldom read.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652493,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 03 15,"History has been kind to Christian Bohr (1855-1911). His name is attached eponymously to three different areas of respiratory physiology. The first is the Bohr dead space, which refers to the portion of the tidal volume that does not undergo gas exchange. The second is the increase in oxygen affinity of hemoglobin caused by the addition of carbon dioxide to the blood. This is known as the Bohr effect and is a very important feature of gas exchange, both in the lung and in peripheral tissues. Both of these contributions by Bohr are familiar to most students. Bohr's third contribution refers to the calculation of the changes in the Po2 of blood as oxygen is loaded in the pulmonary capillary, the so-called Bohr integration. This contribution is less well known now, partly because of the advent of digital computing, but it was important in its day. The analysis is challenging because the very nonlinear shape of the oxygen dissociation curve means that the Po2 difference between the alveolar gas and the capillary blood, which is the driving pressure for diffusion, changes in a complicated way. All three papers are in German, and two of them are long and tedious to read. English translations are available, but few people read the papers, despite the fact that the first two articles are very frequently cited. In the present article, Bohr's contributions are reviewed, and some parts of the articles that are particularly difficult to understand are clarified.",Simultaneous amplification and testing method for Mycobacterium tuberculosis rRNA to differentiate sputum-negative tuberculosis from sarcoidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652492,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 02 28,"We use the simultaneous application and testing method to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis rRNA (SAT-TB) with the endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) biopsy specimens to differentiate sputum-negative tuberculosis from sarcoidosis. In the first part, we validated the SAT-TB on the bronchial or EBUS-TBNA biopsy specimens from sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. In the second part, all EBUS-TBNA specimens for sputum smear-negative intrathoracic tuberculous lymphadenopathies or sarcoidosis were tested with the SAT-TB, acid-fast bacilli smear, and culture. In the 16 sputum-positive tuberculosis cases, 5 showed negative SAT (2 nontuberculous mycobacteria and 3 had anti-tuberculosis therapies previously); the remaining 11 were positive. Of the 41 sputum-negative tuberculosis cases in the second part, five other diseases were negative. In the remaining 36 cases, 27 sarcoidosis cases were negative; 7 in 9 with sputum-negative tuberculosis were positive (77.78%). In these 36 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of the SAT method were 77.78, 100, 100, 93.10, and 94.44%, respectively. The SAT distinguished sputum-negative tuberculosis from sarcoidosis significantly ( P < 0.0001) and identified cases with active M. tuberculosis as accurately as the conventional methods (κ = 0.912, P < 0.0001). We conclude that the SAT-TB may be an effective method for using biopsy specimens to differentiate sputum-negative tuberculosis from sarcoidosis.",Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes improve mitochondrial health in pulmonary arterial hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652491,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 04 17,"Secreted exosomes are bioactive particles that elicit profound responses in target cells. Using targeted metabolomics and global microarray analysis, we identified a role of exosomes in promoting mitochondrial function in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Whereas chronic hypoxia results in a glycolytic shift in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), exosomes restore energy balance and improve O2 consumption. These results were confirmed in a hypoxia-induced mouse model and a semaxanib/hypoxia rat model of PAH wherein exosomes improved the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with disease. Importantly, exosome exposure increased PASMC expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), linking exosome treatment to the TCA cycle. Furthermore, we show that although prolonged hypoxia induced sirtuin 4 expression, an upstream inhibitor of both GLUD1 and PDH, exosomes reduced its expression. These data provide direct evidence of an exosome-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function and contribute new insights into the therapeutic potential of exosomes in PAH.",Fermented dairy foods intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of cohort studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652490,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 01 17,"Since the associations of fermented dairy foods intake with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remained inconsistent, we carried out this meta-analysis on all published cohort studies to estimate the overall effect. We searched the PubMed and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases for all articles within a range of published years from 1980 to 2018 on the association between fermented dairy foods intake and CVD risk. Finally, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, with 385,122 participants, 1,392 Myocardial infarction, 4,490 coronary heart disease (CHD), 7,078 stroke, and 51,707 uncategorized CVD cases. Overall, statistical evidence of significantly decreased CVD risk was found to be associated with fermented dairy foods intake (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.76-0.91). In subgroup analysis, cheese and yogurt consumptions were associated with decreased CVD risk (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94 for cheese and OR = 0. 78, 95% CI = 0.67-0.89 for yogurt). Our meta-analysis indicated that fermented dairy foods intake was associated with decreased CVD risk.",Bioremediation potential of a widespread industrial biowaste as renewable and sustainable biosorbent for synthetic dye pollution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652489,International journal of phytoremediation,2019 04 04,"In this study, a model synthetic azo dye (Basic red 46) bioremoval by Carpinus betulus sawdust as inexpensive, eco-friendly, and sustainable biosorbent from aqueous solution was examined in a batch biosorption system. The effective environmental parameters on the biosorption process, such as the value of pH, amount of biosorbent, initial dye concentration and contact time were optimized using classical test design. The possible dye-biosorbent interaction was determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The equilibrium, thermodynamic, and kinetic studies for the biosorption of Basic red 46 onto the sawdust biomass were performed. In addition, a single-stage batch dye biosorption system was also designed. The dye biosorption yield of biosorbent was significantly influenced by the change of operating variables. The experimental data were best described by the Freundlich isotherm model and both the pseudo-first-order kinetic and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Thermodynamic research indicated that the biosorption of dye was feasible and spontaneous. Based on the Langmuir isotherm model, the biosorbent was found to have a maximum biosorption potential higher than many other biosorbents in the literature (264.915 mg g-1). Thus, this investigation presents a novel green option for the assessment of waste sawdust biomass as a cheap and effective biosorbent material.",Ecological restoration of eroded karst utilizing pioneer moss and vascular plant species with selection based on vegetation diversity and underlying soil chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652488,International journal of phytoremediation,2019 02 01,"Soil erosion in karst areas not only destroys the natural environment but also accelerates the decline in land productivity together with the associated increase in poverty for local communities. There are no simple or straightforward answers to controlling soil erosion on karst. Such erosion has become a serious problem in China. This study addresses both the diversity of vegetation (mosses, herbs, shrubs and trees) on karst and the underlying soil chemical characteristics, in order to provide a scientific basis by which suitable plant species can be selected for recovery and restoration of karst degraded by soil erosion. Vegetation diversity and soil chemistry were assessed in areas with five different grades of soil erosion in Guiyang Karst Park, Guizhou, China. Mosses are more tolerant than vascular plants of soil erosion and associated environmental degradation of karst and the order of species diversity was: mosses > herbs > shrubs > trees. Mosses were found to play a major role in ecological restoration of microhabitats on karst. Soil microbial biomass carbon was found to be significantly higher in soil under mosses than in bare soil associated with other plant categories. Mosses were more effective in converting unavailable potassium to available potassium. Vascular plants were found to have a positive effect on total nitrogen fixation and the availability of phosphorus in the soil. Increasing soil degradation was associated with lower levels of total Nitrogen in soil underlying mosses than in soil underlying vascular plants. Thus, based on their different but complementary contributions to soil chemistry, mosses and vascular plants in combination can provide the most practical outcome for the repair and restoration of areas of karst affected by soil erosion. The combination of the moss species, Homomallium plagiangium, Cyrto-hypnum pygmaeuman and Brachythecium perminusculum, the herbs Veronica arvensis and Youngia japonica, and the tree Prunus salicina, are recommended as suitable pioneer plant species to cultivate for use in restoration of regions of karstic soil erosion.","Growth, biochemical response and nutritional status of Angico-Vermelho (Parapiptadenia rigida (Bentham) Brenan) under the application of soil amendment in Cu-contaminated soil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652487,International journal of phytoremediation,2019 02 01,"Forest species Angico-Vermelho (Parapiptadenia rigida (Bentham) Brenan) is an alternative for the revegetation of areas contaminated with high levels of heavy metals such as copper (Cu). However, excess Cu may cause toxicity to plants, which is why the use of soil amendments can facilitate cultivation by reducing the availability of Cu in the soil. The aim of this study was to assess how the use of amendment can contribute to growth and nutritional status as well as reduce oxidative stress in Angico-Vermelho grown in Cu-contaminated soil. Samples of a Typic Hapludalf soil containing high Cu content were used for the application of four amendments (limestone, organic compost, Ca silicate and zeolite), in addition to a control treatment. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design, with four replicates. The use of amendments decreased Cu content available in soil and contributed to improve both plant nutritional status and its antioxidant response expressed by enzymatic activity. The application of the amendments, especially zeolite and Ca silicate, increased dry matter yield of Angico-Vermelho. Thus, the results presented here suggest that the use of amendments contributes to improving Cu-contaminated soils and favors revegetation with Angico-Vermelho."

Introducing dopants into crystal lattices provides an effective way to optimize the catalytic activities of the oxides as well as their redox properties. Herein, CeO2 nanospheres codoped with Cu and Co (CuCo-CeO2 NSs) were first synthesized and exploited as efficient electrocatalysts for dual-mode electrochemical sensing of microRNA (miRNA). With the doping of Cu and Co into the CeO2 lattice, large amounts of extra oxygen vacancies were generated, remarkably enhancing the redox and electrocatalytic properties of the CeO2 material. The abundant oxygen vacancies of the CuCo-CeO2 NSs were further identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Moreover, Mg2+-induced DNAzyme-assisted target recycling was introduced for ultrasensitive determination. The dual-mode sensing with generality was conducted as follows: First, the CuCo-CeO2 NSs acted as a direct redox mediator to generate a differential-pulse-voltammetry (DPV) signal, which was then greatly amplified by the efficient electrocatalysis of CuCo-CeO2 NSs toward H2O2 decomposition. Second, under the electrocatalysis of CuCo-CeO2 NSs, 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was oxidized to form nonconductive insoluble precipitates (IPs), leading to great amplification of the electrochemical-impedimetric-spectroscopy (EIS) signal. The dual-mode electrochemical sensor showed a wide linear range (0.1 fM to 10 nM) with a low detection limit (33 aM), paving a new way for constructing ultrasensitive electrochemical sensors.",Synthesis of Silicon Quantum Dots with Highly Efficient Full-Band UV Absorption and Their Applications in Antiyellowing and Resistance of Photodegradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652473,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 31,"UV absorbers are very effective in the fields of antiyellowing, resistance of photocatalytic degradation, and sunscreen cosmetics. However, commercialized UV absorbers have the drawbacks of toxicity, low absorption efficiency, transparency, etc. Here, we report for the first time silicon quantum dots as full-band UV absorbers. The NH-refunctionalized silicon quantum dots with high-performance UV absorption were successfully synthesized under the synergistic effect of sodium citrate and ethanediamine, and the (NH, OH)-functionalized silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) with full-band UV absorption can be achieved by reregulating -NH2 and -OH groups on the surface. The as-prepared (NH, OH)-functionalized SiQDs exhibited good stability and underwent treatment of varying pH and temperature. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrated that compared to commercial water-soluble organic UV absorbers, the (NH, OH)-functionalized SiQDs showed better antiyellowing performance for polyurethane and resistance of photocatalytic degradation for rhodamine B, and presented huge application potential in sunscreen cosmetics. Finally, the UV absorption mechanism of SiQDs was explained to be mainly related to Γ → Γ direct band gap transition, which absorb UV light and release it as thermal radiation.","Covalent ""Click Chemistry""-Based Attachment of DNA onto Solid Phase Enables Iterative Molecular Analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652472,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Molecular analysis of DNA samples with limited quantities can be challenging. Repeatedly sequencing the original DNA molecules from a given sample would overcome many issues related to accurate genetic analysis and mitigate issues with processing small amounts of DNA analyte. Moreover, an iterative, replicated analysis of the same DNA molecule has the potential to improve genetic characterization. Herein, we demonstrate that the use of ""click""-based attachment of DNA sequencing libraries onto an agarose bead support enables repetitive primer extension assays for specific genomic DNA targets such as gene exons. We validated the performance of this assay for evaluating specific genetic alterations in both normal and cancer reference standard DNA samples. We demonstrate the stability of conjugated DNA libraries and related sequencing results over the course of independent serial assays spanning several months from the same set of samples. Finally, we finally applied this method to DNA derived from a tumor sample and demonstrated improved mutation detection accuracy.",Rapid and Selective Discrimination of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria by Boronic Acid-Modified Poly(amidoamine) Dendrimer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652471,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 19,"There is an urgent need to develop a rapid and selective method for the detection of bacteria because delayed diagnosis and the overuse of antibiotics have triggered drug resistance in bacteria. To this end, we prepared boronic acid-modified poly(amidoamine) generation 4 (B-PAMAM(G4)) dendrimer as cross-linking molecules that form aggregates with bacteria. Within 5 min of adding B-PAMAM(G4) dendrimer solution to a bacterial suspension, large aggregates were observed. Interestingly, the aggregate formation with various bacteria was pH-dependent. In basic pH, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria formed aggregates, but in neutral pH, only Gram-positive bacteria formed aggregates. We revealed that this bacteria-selective aggregation involved the bacterial surface recognition of the phenylboronic acid moiety of B-PAMAM(G4) dendrimer. In addition, we demonstrated that the spherical structure of B-PAMAM(G4) was one of the important factors for the formation of large aggregates. The aggregation was also observed in the presence of ≤10 mM fructose. B-PAMAM(G4) dendrimer is expected to be a powerful tool for the rapid and selective discrimination between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",Carbon Nanocoil-Based Fast-Response and Flexible Humidity Sensor for Multifunctional Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652470,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 03,"Carbon nanocoils (CNCs) are employed to fabricate fast, high-resolution, and reversible humidity sensor based on a flexible liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate. The humidity sensor displays fast-response (1.9 s) and recovery time (1.5 s), a broad relative humidity (RH) detection range (4-95%), linearity, repeatability, and stability. The rapid response and recovery are considered to benefit from the hydrophobic effect of the LCP substrate and high purity of the CNCs, which give rise to weak physical adsorption. Meanwhile, the high sensitivity results from both the unique helical structure of CNCs and the microporous structure of the LCP substrate. The distinctive structure-related properties enable the sensor to reliably perceive an extremely small RH variation of 0.8%, which is too small to be detected by most humidity sensors reported previously. These features allow the sensor to monitor a variety of important human activities, such as respiration, speaking, blowing, and noncontact fingertip sensation, accurately. Furthermore, different human physical conditions can be distinguished by recognizing the respiration response patterns. In addition, the long-term operation and mechanical bending do not adversely affect the sensing performance.",Influence of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes as Additives in Biomass-Derived Carbons for Supercapacitor Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652469,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 31,"Glucose-derived carbon/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid materials were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of glucose in the presence of CNTs and subsequent carbonization, physical activation, or chemical activation. The proportion of CNTs added during the hydrothermal polymerization of glucose was varied to ascertain the optimum dose to maximize the performance of the carbon hybrids in supercapacitor applications. Both the thermal treatment applied and the addition of CNTs lead to changes in the textural and chemical properties of the activated carbons. It was observed that samples bearing CNTs exhibit higher number of nucleation centers for glucose oligomers to polymerize, and consequently, the behavior of the hydrothermal carbon toward activation differs according to the activating agent employed. Moreover, the initial chemical speciation dominated by acidic groups shifts to more basic functionalities (quinones and carbonyl groups) with the addition of CNTs. The effect of the different physicochemical properties of the prepared carbons on their electrochemical behavior was evaluated. The addition of 2 wt % of CNTs and subsequent chemical activation leads to electrode materials yielding 206 F g-1 and 78% of capacitance retention up to 0.8 V and 20 A g-1 and high rate cyclability (97% after 5000 cycles). The outstanding performance is ascribed to the high surface area, narrow mesopores, and phenol/carbonyl surface functionalities, which enhance molecular diffusion, the amount of stored energy, and electronic transportation, respectively.",Efficiently Rotating the Magnetization Vector in a Magnetic Semiconductor via Organic Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652468,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 26,"Local manipulation of the magnetization direction is of significant importance in spintronics because it provides an effective way in nonvolatile device applications for ultrahigh density information storage. However, this modulation is usually restricted to a limited range even through large power input. We demonstrate a large rotation of the magnetization vector in a magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As (110) thin film by surface decoration of self-assembled molecules. The carrier density of the film is vastly changed by two kinds of molecules acting as electron donors and acceptors, resulting in a prominent variation of the Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy. The magnetic anisotropic fields tuned by the molecules could be quantitatively determined by planar Hall measurements, based on which the largest rotation angle is calculated to be ∼27°. This value doubles the result obtained by the electric field up to 0.4 V/nm, which is approaching the breakdown strength of common dielectrics.

The correlation between numerical study of the chemical changes at the electrode-electrolyte interface and experimental results during the dynamic potential scan was built successfully.

One burgeoning solution is to encapsulate single cell into droplets on the platform of the microfluidic chip. However, the manufacture of the droplet-based microfluidic chip requires sophisticated fabrication and limits its potential application. In this paper, we presented an off-the-shelf three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic device by assembling commercially available parts without any proficient manufacturing process. Uniform monodisperse microdroplet was generated from the 3D microfluidic device with a size variation of 1.5%, and the innner diameter of the 3D microfluidic device was the same as the nebulizer (150 μm). The proposed 3D microfluidic device-time-resolved ICPMS system was applied to detect silver in single AgNPs (51 nm), and the result is in good agreement with conventional acid digestion method, demonstrating the accuracy of the method. Silver uptake behaviors in HepG2 cells were then studied by incubating with Ag+ or AgNPs under biocompatible conditions.

The absolute lymphocyte count was recorded before treatment. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff for defining lymphocytopenia in the NAC cohort and followed by multivariate analysis. Subsequently, lymphocytopenia was assessed in the PDS cohort by multivariate analysis. A further analysis was performed to evaluate the absolute lymphocyte count as a continuous variable. An absolute lymphocyte count of 1.49 × 109/L was determined as the cutoff for the ROC curve analysis in the NAC cohort, and the multivariate analysis revealed that lymphocytopenia was an independent prognostic factor for poor progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR), 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-2.11] and overall survival (OS) (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.21-3.40).

The grade of evidence for specific treatment of childhood bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis (CF) is low with very few randomized controlled trials. Treatment has been based mainly on evidence from studies in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and patients with cystic fibrosis. Recently, long-term treatment with macrolides has been proposed. These molecules offer the advantage of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in addition to their antibacterial properties. A total of three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials conducted in adults showed that macrolides taken for 6-12 months led to a significant reduction in exacerbation rates. Only one long-term, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the pediatric population. It showed that azithromycin administered weekly for up to 24 months reduced pulmonary exacerbations. Further randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment with macrolides. The clinical profile of children who would benefit from this treatment also needs to be determined.",Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on the gut microbiome and colorectal adenoma development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652422,Cancer medicine,2019 04 30,"It has been previously reported that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a therapeutic bile acid, reduced risk for advanced colorectal adenoma in men but not women. Interactions between the gut microbiome and fecal bile acid composition as a factor in colorectal cancer neoplasia have been postulated but evidence is limited to small cohorts and animal studies. Using banked stool samples collected as part of a phase III randomized clinical trial of UDCA for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we compared change in the microbiome composition after a 3-year intervention in a subset of participants randomized to oral UDCA at 8-10 mg/kg of body weight per day (n = 198) or placebo (n = 203). Study participants randomized to UDCA experienced compositional changes in their microbiome that were statistically more similar to other individuals in the UDCA arm than to those in the placebo arm. This reflected a UDCA-associated shift in microbial community composition (P < 0.001), independent of sex, with no evidence of a UDCA effect on microbial richness (P > 0.05). These UDCA-associated shifts in microbial community distance metrics from baseline to end-of-study were not associated with risk of any or advanced adenoma (all P > 0.05) in men or women. Separate analyses of microbial networks revealed an overrepresentation of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the post-UDCA arm and an inverse relationship between F prausnitzii and Ruminococcus gnavus. In men who received UDCA, the overrepresentation of F prausnitzii and underrepresentation of R gnavus were more prominent in those with no adenoma recurrence at follow-up compared to men with recurrence. This relationship was not observed in women. Daily UDCA use modestly influences the relative abundance of microbial species in stool and affects the microbial network composition with suggestive evidence for sex-specific effects of UDCA on stool microbial community composition as a modifier of colorectal adenoma risk.",Online education for gluten-free diet teaching: Development and usability testing of an e-learning module for children with concurrent celiac disease and type 1 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652421,Pediatric diabetes,2019 04 23,"Celiac disease (CD), the most common genetically-based food intolerance, affects 3% to 16% of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

The influence of sex on dCA remains unclear. dCA in 11 fit women (25 ± 2 years) and 11 age-matched men (24 ± 1 years) was compared using a multimodal approach including a sit-to-stand (STS) and forced BP oscillations (repeated squat-stand performed at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz). Prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension (IOH; decrease in systolic ≥ 40 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 20 mmHg) during the first 15 sec of STS was determined as a functional outcome. In women, the decrease in mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAvmean ) following the STS was greater (-20 ± 8 vs. -11 ± 7 cm sec-1 ; P = 0.018) and the onset of the regulatory change (time lapse between the beginning of the STS and the increase in the conductance index (MCAvmean /mean arterial pressure) was delayed (P = 0.007).

Prevalence of IOH was comparable between groups (women: 4/9 vs. men: 5/9, P = 0.637).

This study explored the distribution and evolutionary history of this gene cluster in the genus Pseudoalteromonas. A phylogeny of the genus revealed numerous clades that do not contain type strains, suggesting considerable species level diversity has yet to be described. Comparative genomics revealed four distinct versions of the gene cluster distributed among 19 of the 101 Pseudoalteromonas genomes examined. These were largely localized to the least inclusive clades containing the Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea and Pseudoalteromonas phenolica type strains and show clear evidence of gene and gene cluster loss in certain lineages. Bmp gene phylogeny is largely congruent with the Pseudoalteromonas species phylogeny, suggesting vertical inheritance within the genus. However, the gene cluster is found in three different genomic environments suggesting either chromosomal rearrangement or multiple acquisition events. Bmp conservation within certain lineages suggests the encoded products are highly relevant to the ecology of these bacteria.",Critical function of DNA methyltransferase 1 in tomato development and regulation of the DNA methylome and transcriptome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652405,Journal of integrative plant biology,2019 04 19,"DNA methylation confers epigenetic regulation on gene expression and thereby on various biological processes. Tomato has emerged as an excellent system to study the function of DNA methylation in plant development. To date, regulation and function of DNA methylation maintenance remains unclear in tomato plants. Here, we report the critical function of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Methyltransferase 1 (SlMET1) in plant development and DNA methylome and transcriptome regulation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we generated slmet1 mutants and observed severe developmental defects with a frame-shift mutation, including small and curly leaves, defective inflorescence, and parthenocarpy. In leaf tissues, mutations in SlMET1 caused CG hypomethylation and CHH hypermethylation on a whole-genome scale, leading to a disturbed transcriptome including ectopic expression of many RIN target genes such as ACC2 in leaf tissues, which are normally expressed in fruits. Neither the CG hypomethylation nor CHH hypermethylation in the slmet1 mutants is related to tissue culture. Meanwhile, tissue culture induces non-CG hypomethylation, which occurs more frequently at gene regions than at TE regions. Our results depict SlMET1- and tissue culture-dependent tomato DNA methylomes, and that SlMET1 is required for maintaining a normal transcriptome and normal development of tomato.",Directional Threading and Sliding of a Dissymmetrical Foldamer Helix on Dissymmetrical Axles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652404,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 15,We have investigated the self-assembly of a dissymmetrical aromatic oligoamide helix on linear amido-carbamate rods. A dissymmetric sequence bearing two differentiated ends is able to wrap around dissymmetric dumbbell guest molecules. Structural and thermodynamic investigations allowed us to decipher the mode of binding of the helix that can bind specifically to the amide and carbamate groups of the rod. In parallel kinetic studies of threading and sliding of the helix along linear axles were also monitored by 1 H NMR. Results show that threading of a dissymmetrical host can be kinetically biased by the nature of the guest terminus allowing a preferential sense of sliding of the helix. The study presented below further demonstrates the valuable potential of foldaxanes to combine designed molecular recognition patterns with fine control of self-assembly kinetics to conceive complex supramolecular events.,Blinded sample size reestimation in event-driven clinical trials: Methods and an application in multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652403,Pharmaceutical statistics,2019 05 17,,Not CD68 but stabilin-1 expression is associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652402,Head & neck,2019 01 17,This study's aim was to identify CD68 and stabilin-1 expressions and their prognostic implications in patients with oral cavity cancer (OCC).,Nested combination tests with a time-to-event endpoint using a short-term endpoint for design adaptations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652401,Pharmaceutical statistics,2019 05 17,"Adaptive trial methodology for multiarmed trials and enrichment designs has been extensively discussed in the past. A general principle to construct test procedures that control the family-wise Type I error rate in the strong sense is based on combination tests within a closed test. Using survival data, a problem arises when using information of patients for adaptive decision making, which are under risk at interim. With the currently available testing procedures, either no testing of hypotheses in interim analyses is possible or there are restrictions on the interim data that can be used in the adaptation decisions as, essentially, only the interim test statistics of the primary endpoint may be used. We propose a general adaptive testing procedure, covering multiarmed and enrichment designs, which does not have these restrictions. An important application are clinical trials, where short-term surrogate endpoints are used as basis for trial adaptations, and we illustrate how such trials can be designed. We propose statistical models to assess the impact of effect sizes, the correlation structure between the short-term and the primary endpoint, the sample size, the timing of interim analyses, and the selection rule on the operating characteristics.",The effect of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other psychiatric disorders on the treatment of pediatric diabetes mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652399,Pediatric diabetes,2019 04 23,"Psychiatric diagnoses of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the severity of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms of the patients and their primary caregivers, and the effects of these factors on treatment were investigated.",Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Aldol Reaction of α-Alkoxyamides to α-Fluorinated Ketones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652398,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 02 11,"α-Oxygen-functionalized amides found particular utility as enolate surrogates for direct aldol couplings with α-fluorinated ketones in a catalytic manner.

Community characterization of metabolically active communities via RNA sequencing has previously revealed differences between 'active' and 'total' fungal communities, which may be influenced by the persistence of DNA from nonactive components. However, it is not known how fungal traits influence their prevalence in these contrasting community profiles. In this study, we coextracted DNA and RNA from soil collected from three Antarctic islands to test for differences between total and active soil fungal communities. By matching these geographically isolated fungi against a global dataset of soil fungi, we show that widely dispersed taxa are often more abundant in the total community, whilst taxa restricted to Antarctica are more likely to have higher abundance in the active community. In addition, we find that active communities have lower richness, and show a reduction in the abundance of the most dominant fungi, whilst there are consistent differences in the abundances of certain taxonomic groups between the total and active communities. These results suggest that the views of soil fungal communities offered by DNA- and RNA-based characterization differ in predictable ways."

Such evolutionary morphological analyses rely on three interconnected conceptual frameworks; multivariate morphometrics for quantifying similarity and differences among taxa, quantitative genetics for modeling the inheritance and evolution of morphology, and neutral theory for assessing the likelihood that taxon diversification is due to stochastic processes such as genetic drift. Importantly, neutral theory provides a framework for testing more parsimonious explanations for observed morphological differences before considering more complex adaptive scenarios. However, the consistency with which these concepts are applied varies considerably, which mirrors some of the theoretical obstacles faced during the ""modern synthesis"" of classical population genetics in the early 20th century.

The nature and concentration of the biomolecules strongly influence the degree of the crystallinity, the morphology, and the textural properties of the resulting γ-AlOOH and γ-Al2 O3 nanosheets, allowing for easy tuning. The hierarchical γ-AlOOH and γ-Al2 O3 multilayered nanosheets synthesized by using biomolecules exhibit enhanced crystallinity, improved particle separation, and well-defined multilayered structures compared to those obtained without biomolecules. More impressively, these γ-AlOOH and γ-Al2 O3 nanosheets possess high surface areas up to 425 and 371 m2  g-1 , respectively, due to their mesoporous nature and hierarchical multilayered structure. When employed for molybdenum adsorption toward medical radioisotope production, the hierarchical γ-Al2 O3 multilayered nanosheets exhibit Mo adsorption capacities of 33.1-40.8 mg g-1 .

However, the mechanisms both of these in colon cancer progression are still unknown. In this work, the detailed roles and mechanisms of UCA1 and its target genes in colon cancer were studied. The results showed that UCA1 was upregulated in colon cancer tissues when compared with the adjacent nonhumorous tissues, as well as in the various colon cancer cell lines, but the expression of miR-28-5p showed an opposite trend. Furthermore, a high UCA1 level in colon cancer tissues is positively associated with the tumor size and advanced tumor stages. Functional assays revealed that both UCA1 knockdown and miR-28-5p overexpression could inhibit colon cancer cell growth and migration. Further mechanistic studies indicated that UCA1 knockdown played tumor suppressive roles in SW480 and HT116 cells through binding with miR-28-5p. We also, for the first time, identified HOXB3 as the target gene of miR-28-5p and that HOXB3 overexpression could mediate the functions of UCA1 in cell proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells. In conclusion, our data provided evidence for the regulatory network of UCA1/miR-28-5p/HOXB3 in colon cancer, suggesting that UCA1, miR-28-5p, and HOXB3 are the potential targets for colon cancer therapy.","""I'm not what I used to be"": A qualitative study exploring how young people experience being diagnosed with a chronic illness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652354,"Child: care, health and development",2019 02 20,"Childhood long-term conditions are usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood.

However, the regulatory mechanism underlying EMT and TIF are still unclear. Previous studies showed that the decrease in the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was closely related to the aggravation of DN, but no published study showed how PTEN participated in the regulation of EMT and TIF. In this study, the rat proximal tubular epithelial cells (NRK52E) and C57BL mice and human kidney tissues were used as the research objects to investigate the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ) on PTEN and its influence on EMT and TIF, the regulation of PTEN's dual activity of lipid phosphatase/protein phosphatase by the serine threonine protein kinase B(AKT)/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway, and the role of PTEN in EMT and TIF. The results showed that PPARγ regulated the expression of PTEN at a transcriptional level and further regulated EMT and TIF. This dual activity could regulate the phosphorylation level of AKT and FAK and also affect FAK transcription. However, the 129 mutant of PTEN (PTEN-G129E) lost the lipid phosphatase activity, and its protein phosphatase activity was involved only in EMT and renal fibrosis through regulating FAK phosphorylation.

The expression of lncRNA UCA1 was measured in A549 and A549/DDP cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expressions of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail were detected in A549 and A549/DDP cells by Western blot analysis. Results showed that the IC 50 of DDP was 16.20 ± 2.27 μmol/L and 69.72 ± 4.83 μmol/L in A549 and A549/ DDP cells, respectively. Compared with the A549 group, the expressions of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail was significantly upregulated in A549/DDP group, but E-cadherin was significantly downregulated. Compared with the shCon group, the abundance of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail was significantly downregulated in short hairpin RNA UCA1 (shUCA1) group, while E-cadherin was significantly upregulated. Cell migration and invasion were significantly suppressed and IC 50 was reversed to 16.20 ± 2.27 μmol/L in the shUCA1 group. Silencing lncRNA UCA1 inhibited the migration and invasion of A549/DDP cells and reversed the resistance of A549/DDP cells to DDP.

Technetium (99mTc) Sestamibi is the most commercialized radiopharmaceutical in the world. It includes a coordination complex consisting of the radioisotope 99 m technetium bound to six copper tetramibi tetrafluorborate ligands, and is mainly used to image the myocardium via scintigraphy. As radiopharmaceuticals are regarded as drugs, they are subject to the same regulations; therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a quantification method for the active pharmaceutical ingredient before their complexation with the radioisotope by employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodology. A simple and efficient method (retention time = 2.5 min) was developed and validated for copper tetramibi tetrafluorborate in the final product using a buffer and organic solvent mixtures (ACN-methanol-ammonium sulfate buffer) and a C18 column. The analytical protocol was fast, taking around 30 min until evaluation of results. The validation parameters were evaluated with satisfactory results: in terms of linearity r > 0.99 (160-240 μg/mL) and no deviation was observed. The RSD of precision was <5%, and an average recovery of 99% was observed for accuracy.

Although it is common to adopt propensity score analysis to this purpose, prognostic score analysis has recently been proposed as an alternative strategy. While both approaches were originally introduced to estimate causal effects for binary interventions, the theory of propensity score has since been extended to the case of general treatment regimes. Indeed, many treatments are not assigned in a binary fashion and require a certain extent of dosing. Hence, researchers may often be interested in estimating treatment effects across multiple exposures. To the best of our knowledge, the prognostic score analysis has not been yet generalised to this case. In this article, we describe the theory of prognostic scores for causal inference with general treatment regimes. Our methods can be applied to compare multiple treatments using nonrandomised data, a topic of great relevance in contemporary evaluations of clinical interventions. We propose estimators for the average treatment effects in different populations of interest, the validity of which is assessed through a series of simulations. Finally, we present an illustrative case in which we estimate the effect of the delay to Aspirin administration on a composite outcome of death or dependence at 6 months in stroke patients.","Revitalizing Spin Natural Orbital Analysis: Electronic Structures of Mixed-Valence Compounds, Singlet Biradicals, and Antiferromagnetically Coupled Systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652332,Journal of computational chemistry,2019 02 21,"Chemical systems with open-shell electronic structure have been gaining attention these days.

However, it did not include diacylglycerol (DAG) and unesterified fatty acids (FFA) known to be associated with freshness of the oil. The newly improved FT-NIR method now includes 1,2-DAG and 1,3-DAG models based on the DAG isomer content in freshly prepared EVOO, and a FFA model based on quantitative addition of oleic acid. The new FT-NIR method was used to reassess previously used EVOO products to evaluate their freshness. Based on these results and review of the published data, we propose several revisions to the EVOO regulation: limit FFA to ≤0.5%, include 1,2-DAG and 1,3-DAG in standard, place no limit on 1,2-DAG because it characterizes the oils, set the 1,3-DAG content to ≤1.0%, and lower the content of 18:2n-6 to 1.5%.",Imidazole alkaloids inhibit the pro-inflammatory mechanisms of human neutrophil and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652314,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2019 04 13,Epiisopiloturine (EPI) and epiisopilosine (EPIIS) are side products in the pharmaceutical industry.

Although supplemental oxygen is beneficial to treat hypoxia, its use is also associated with poor outcomes and high mortality in patients. Lung injury due to hyperoxia exposure has been well-documented in patients, including in adults and neonates. Thus, lung injury due to hyperoxia has been extensively researched in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, hyperoxia has also been shown to be associated with hemodynamic changes in patients in ICU, including reductions in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. In addition, certain experimental studies report that hyperoxia exposure in neonates results in cardiac dysfunction in later adult life. Despite this, until recently, the impact of hyperoxia within the heart has not been well studied, or reported, specifically in adult experimental models. To close this significant gap, our lab has sought to clarify hyperoxia-induced cardiac pathophysiology in adult murine models. This review discusses the current findings regarding the cardiovascular impact of hyperoxia exposure.",Identification of differentially expressed genes and biological characteristics of colorectal cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652311,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 01 17,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide.

The gene expression profiles of GSE21510, GSE32323, GSE89076, and GSE113513 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After screening DEGs in each GEO data set, we further used the robust rank aggregation method to identify 494 significant DEGs including 212 upregulated and 282 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed by DAVID and the KOBAS online database, respectively. These DEGs were shown to be significantly enriched in different cancer-related functions and pathways. Then, the STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction network. The module analysis was performed by the MCODE plug-in of Cytoscape based on the whole network. We finally filtered out seven hub genes by the cytoHubba plug-in, including PPBP, CCL28, CXCL12, INSL5, CXCL3, CXCL10, and CXCL11. The expression validation and survival analysis of these hub genes were analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database.

Recent years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been studied in human diseases, including CH. According to bioinformatics analysis, 10 lncRNAs possibly involved in the progression of CH were screened out. Among which, lncRNA SYNE1 antisense RNA 1 (SYNE1-AS1) could be upregulated by Angiotensin II (Ang-II) in cardiomyocytes. Thus, we chose SYNE1-AS1 to do further study. To identify the biological function of SYNE1-AS1 in CH, SYNE1-AS1 was silenced in Ang-II-induced cardiomyocytes. Results of immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that increased cell surface area in Ang-II-induced cardiomyocytes was reduced by SYNE1-AS1 knockdown. Moreover, the hypertrophic responses were attenuated by SYNE1-AS1 knockdown. Mechanically, SYNE1-AS1 positively regulated Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) by sponging microRNA-525-5p (miR-525-5p). On the basis of previous reports, SP1 can transcriptionally activate lncRNAs. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between SP1 and SYNE1-AS1 promoter. Intriguingly, SYNE1-AS1 was activated by SP1. At last, rescue assays demonstrated the function of SP1-SYNE1-AS1 axis in CH. In conclusion, SP1-induced upregulation of lncRNA SYNE1-AS1 promoted CH via miR-525-5p/SP1 axis.",RhoGDIβ affects HeLa cell spindle orientation following UVC irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652309,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 01 17,"The molecular signals that regulate mitotic spindle orientation to determine the proper division axis play a critical role in the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. However, deregulation of signaling events can result in spindle misorientation, which in turn can trigger developmental defects and cancer progression. Little is known about the cellular signaling pathway involved in the misorientation of proliferating cells that evade apoptosis after DNA damage. In this study, we found that perturbations to spindle orientation were induced in ultraviolet C (UVC)-irradiated surviving cells. N-terminal truncated Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor β (RhoGDIβ), which is produced by UVC irradiation, distorted the spindle orientation of HeLa cells cultured on Matrigel. The short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of RhoGDIβ significantly attenuated UVC-induced misorientation. Subsequent expression of wild-type RhoGDIβ, but not a noncleavable mutant, RhoGDIβ (D19A), again led to a relative increase in spindle misorientation in response to UVC. Our findings revealed that RhoGDIβ impacts spindle orientation in response to DNA damage.",Epigenetic mechanisms are behind the regulation of the key genes associated with the osteoblastic differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells: The role of zoledronic acid on tuning the epigenetic changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652308,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 01 17,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells and show distinct features such as capability for self-renewal and differentiation into several lineages of cells including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. In this study, the methylation status of the promoter region of zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16), twist-related protein 1(Twist1), de novo DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A), SRY-box 9 (Sox9), osteocalcin (OCN), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) genes and their messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were evaluated during the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs (ODMSCs). We planned two experimental groups including zoledronic acid (ZA)-treated and nontreated cells (negative control) which both were differentiated into the osteoblasts. Methylation level of DNA in the promoter regions was assayed by methylation-specific-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MS-qPCR), and mRNA levels of the target inhibitory/stimulatory genes during osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs were measured using real-time PCR. During the experimental induction of ODMSCs, the mRNA expression of the OCN gene was upregulated and methylation level of its promoter region was decreased. Moreover, Sox9 and PPARγ2 mRNA levels were attenuated and their promoter regions methylation levels were significantly augmented. However, the mRNA expression of the DNMT3A was not affected during the ODMSCs though its methylation rate was increased. In addition, ZA could enhance the expression of the ZBTB16 and decrease its promoter regions methylation and on the opposite side, it diminished mRNA expression of Sox9, Twist1, and PPARγ2 genes and increased their methylation rates. Intriguingly, ZA did not show a significant impact on gene expression and methylation levels the OCN and DNMT3A. We found that methylation of the promoter regions of Sox9, OCN, and PPARγ2 genes might be one of the main mechanisms adjusting the genes expression during the ODMSCs. Furthermore, we noticed that ZA can accelerate the MSCs differentiation to the osteoblast cells via two regulatory processes; suppression of osteoblastic differentiation inhibitor genes including Sox9, Twist1, and PPARγ2, and through promotion of the ZBTB16 expression.",Efficacy and acceptability of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: A network meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652307,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,The optimal sequence of endocrine therapy in a neoadjuvant setting for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is unclear.

Here, we apply a phylogenetic approach to study the evolution of ornamental dorsal fins in male poeciliid fish of the subgenera Mollienesia and Limia, which exhibit convergent development of an enlarged dorsal fin, and often direct erect-fin displays to male and female conspecifics. Unlike prior categorical assessments of poeciliid adornments, we measure dorsal fin exaggeration with a continuous index of ornamentation. Phylogenetic logistic and generalized least squares regression analyses indicate that high index values are significantly associated with the use of two component postures of courtship and aggressive displays, dorsal fin erection and body curvature, but not with the presence of sexual dichromatism. Male displays initially evolved for male-male aggression in the common ancestor of Mollienesia and Limia, suggesting that this signal originated for competition, then became co-opted for courtship. These results support the armament-ornament hypothesis for evolution of exaggerated male traits, and are consistent with an evolutionary shift in the predominant mechanisms of sexual selection from intra- to intersexual.",Podocan affects C2C12 myogenic differentiation by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652305,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Podocan, a small leucine-rich repeat protein, is a negative regulator of cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrated that podocan is involved in the differentiation of C2C12 murine myoblasts. Podocan expression increased with the progression of C2C12 differentiation. As expect, siRNA-mediated podocan knockdown inhibited C2C12 differentiation, as indicated by inhibition of MYOG, MYH2, and desmin expression, as well as reductions in the differentiation and fusion indices. Overexpression of podocan using dCas9 technology promoted C2C12 cell differentiation. In addition, supplementation of culture medium with podocan influenced C2C12 differentiation. Podocan knockdown reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling, characterized by a reduction in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, whereas podocan overexpression had the opposite effect. Furthermore, treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin, reduced the podocan-mediated promotion of C2C12 differentiation. Induction of muscle injury in mice by bupivacaine administration suggested that podocan may play a role in muscle regeneration. In summary, our results suggest that podocan is required for normal C2C12 differentiation and that its role in myogenesis is mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

As for cereals, numerous studies of CRISPR/Cas9 have been reported predominately on rice and quite a few on other cereals including maize, wheat, and barley. In contrast, there are only a couple of reports on sorghum up to date. In this chapter, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been investigated for sorghum genome editing through biolistic bombardment. Two target genes, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and phytoene desaturase (PDS), have been investigated by CRISPR/Cas9 though bomboarment. Successful genome editing has been achieved within the sorghum genotype Tx430. Furthermore, sequencing PCR product of transgenic plants has confirmed that the CRISPR/Cas9 successfully edited the target gene in sorghum. Both homozygosis and heterozygosis editings of CAD gene have been confirmed in T0 primary transgenic lines through sequencing PCR products. T1 generation of CRISPR plants has been investigated as well. The results illustrated that the edited gene has passed down to next generation. More experiments, such as optimizing promoters for guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 in sorghum, are under investigation.

With this increase in research, reliable methodology for the extraction, identification, and quantification of individual carotenoids and tocochromanols species from sorghum and other cereal grains is essential.

Therefore, sorghum is an important source of nutrients for millions of inhabitants in these regions. In light of this, the nutritional quality of sorghum and how this is assessed is of major research interest. Various assays have been used to determine the contents of macronutrients and micronutrients in sorghum including how digestible and bioaccessible these are.

Unlike random mutagenesis, a pedigreed mutant library, once properly established, can serve as a powerful resource to isolate and recover mutations of both agronomical and biological importance. With the development of affordable and high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies, identification of causal mutations from a mutant library with a uniform genetic background becomes increasingly efficient and cost-effective.

As in maize, doubled haploid (DH) is the key technology to speed up the breeding process in sorghum. Through 3 years of efforts, two haploid inducer lines, SMHI01 and SMHI02, were discovered by screening 4000 germplasms worldwide. These two inducers have been evaluated in different growth environments and have shown to generate haploids at frequency of 1-2%. The putative haploids produced with these two inducers were evaluated and ploidy was confirmed cytologically and biochemically. The discovery of these inducer lines is the first step toward a revolutionary change in sorghum breeding."

The endogenous pool of PKA is targeted to the mitochondrion by forming a complex with the mitochondrial scaffold A-kinase anchoring protein 121 (AKAP121). Enhanced PKA signaling via AKAP121 leads to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the fission modulator Drp1, leading to enhanced mitochondrial networks and thereby blocking apoptosis against different toxic insults. In this study, we show for the first time that AKAP121/PKA confers neuroprotection in an in vitro model of oxidative stress induced by exposure to excess glutamate. Unexpectedly, treating mouse hippocampal progenitor neuronal HT22 cells with an acute dose or chronic exposure of glutamate robustly elevates PKA signaling, a beneficial compensatory response that is phenocopied in HT22 cells conditioned to thrive in the presence of excess glutamate but not in parental HT22 cells. Secondly, redirecting the endogenous pool of PKA by transiently transfecting AKAP121 or transfecting a constitutively active mutant of PKA targeted to the mitochondrion (OMM-PKA) or of an isoform of AKAP121 that lacks the KH and Tudor domains (S-AKAP84) are sufficient to significantly block cell death induced by glutamate toxicity but not in an oxygen deprivation/reperfusion model. Conversely, transient transfection of HT22 neuronal cells with a PKA-binding-deficient mutant of AKAP121 is unable to protect against oxidative stress induced by glutamate toxicity suggesting that the catalytic activity of PKA is required for AKAP121's protective effects. Mechanistically, AKAP121 promotes neuroprotection by enhancing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1 to increase mitochondrial fusion, elevates ATP levels, and elicits an increase in the levels of antioxidants GSH and superoxide dismutase 2 leading to a reduction in the level of mitochondrial superoxide. Overall, our data supports AKAP121/PKA as a new molecular target that confers neuroprotection against glutamate toxicity by phosphorylating Drp1, to stabilize mitochondrial networks and mitochondrial function and to elicit antioxidant responses.",Activation of mGluR1 Mediates C1q-Dependent Microglial Phagocytosis of Glutamatergic Synapses in Alzheimer's Rodent Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652266,Molecular neurobiology,2019 01 22,"Microglia and complements appear to be involved in the synaptic and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, utilizing two types of rodent model of AD, we reported increased complement C1q-mediated microglial phagocytosis of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses, which led to synaptic and cognitive deficits. We also found increased activity of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in hippocampal CA1 in the modeled rodents. Artificial activation of mGluR1 signaling promoted dephosphorylation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and facilitated the local translation machinery of synaptic C1q mRNA, thus mimicking the C1q-mediated microglial phagocytosis of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses and synaptic and cognitive deficiency in the modeled rodents. However, suppression of mGluR1 signaling inhibited the dephosphorylation of FMRP and repressed the local translation of synaptic C1q mRNA, which consequently alleviated microglial phagocytosis of synapses and restored the synaptic and cognitive function in the rodent models. These findings illustrate a novel molecular mechanism underlying C1q-mediated microglial phagocytosis of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses in AD.",Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DReSS): How Far Have We Come?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652265,American journal of clinical dermatology,2019 04 09,"Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DReSS), also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS), is an uncommon severe adverse reaction to medications.

Despite the success of approved therapies, commonly reported side effects and the need for continual use has led to the investigation of alternative therapies. The aim of this paper is to critically review the success of off-label, topical monotherapies for treatment of AGA in men. A literature search was conducted to obtain randomized, controlled and blinded studies that investigated off-label, topical, monotherapies in male patients. Hair density, hair diameter and hair growth were used to evaluate treatment success. Fourteen off-label topical therapies were investigated among the 16 studies that met inclusion criteria. Nine off-label therapies were reported to produce a significantly greater improvement in hair restoration parameters (e.g. mean change from hair count and hair diameter) as compared to placebo (p < 0.05 for all treatments). In two studies, procyanidin oligomers exhibited greater efficacy over vehicle with response to mean change in hair density (hairs/cm2) (ps < 0.0001 at Week 24). In conclusion, prostaglandin analogs and polyphenols, such as latanoprost and procyanidin oligomers, can improve hair restoration parameters in male AGA patients, possibly through targeting mechanisms proposed in the etiology of AGA. The current evidence suggests short-term (24 weeks) use may provide benefit for hair loss patients; however, long-term efficacy and safety data are required.","Carvacrol Depends on Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to Exert Antioxidant, Anti-inflammatory, and Mitochondria-Related Protection in the Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells Line Exposed to Hydrogen Peroxide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652259,Neurochemical research,2019 04 26,"The link between mitochondrial dysfunction, redox impairment, and inflammation leads to increased rates of brain cells loss in neurodegenerative diseases and in affective disorders. Carvacrol (CAR) is a component of essential oils found in Labiatae. CAR exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in different cell types, as assessed in both in vitro and in vivo experimental designs. Nonetheless, it was not previously investigated whether and how CAR would prevent mitochondrial impairment in human cells exposed to a pro-oxidant challenge. Therefore, we analyzed here whether a pretreatment (for 4 h) with CAR (10-1000 µM) would promote mitochondrial protection in the human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We found that CAR at 100 µM prevented the H2O2-induced decline in the activity of the complexes I and V, as well as on the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CAR also prevented the H2O2-elicited decrease in the activity of the mitochondrial enzymes aconitase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase. Moreover, CAR induced an antioxidant action by decreasing the levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and protein nitration in the mitochondrial membranes. Interestingly, CAR prevented the pro-inflammatory action of H2O2 by downregulating the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The inhibition of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX, 10 µM) suppressed the preventive effects caused by CAR regarding mitochondrial function and inflammation.

Rats received either OPZ, LPZ (50 mg/kg/day, p.o.) individually for 7 days with concurrent administration of isoproterenol (ISO) (150 mg/kg, s.c.) on 6th and 7th day of study period to induce myocardial infarction. On the 8th day after measuring hemodynamic parameters, rats were killed and parameters were evaluated. ECG waves were found to be normal in the treatment group. ISO control rats revealed escalation in the oxidative stress as evidenced by depletion in the content of SOD, GSH, catalase and increase in the level of MDA and NO as compared with the normal rats. Treatment with OPZ and LPZ significantly reduced the ROS, indicated by an increase in the endogenous antioxidants and a decrease in NO and MDA levels. ISO control rats showed a significant elevation in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α as compared to the normal and treatment group of rats. Administration of OPZ and LPZ does not exhibit any significant toxicity. Our findings reveal that multiple doses of OPZ and LPZ may have distinctly minimized the ISO-induced myocardial necrosis by declining the hmodynamic parameters, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in myocardial infarcted rats.",Sequential sampling models with variable boundaries and non-normal noise: A comparison of six models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652240,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2019 06 11,"One of the most prominent response-time models in cognitive psychology is the diffusion model, which assumes that decision-making is based on a continuous evidence accumulation described by a Wiener diffusion process. In the present paper, we examine two basic assumptions of standard diffusion model analyses. Firstly, we address the question of whether participants adjust their decision thresholds during the decision process. Secondly, we investigate whether so-called Lévy-flights that allow for random jumps in the decision process account better for experimental data than do diffusion models. Specifically, we compare the fit of six different versions of accumulator models to data from four conditions of a number-letter classification task. The experiment comprised a simple single-stimulus task and a more difficult multiple-stimulus task that were both administered under speed versus accuracy conditions. Across the four experimental conditions, we found little evidence for a collapsing of decision boundaries. However, our results suggest that the Lévy-flight model with heavy-tailed noise distributions (i.e., allowing for jumps in the accumulation process) fits data better than the Wiener diffusion model.","Understanding individual differences in theory of mind via representation of minds, not mental states.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652239,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2019 06 11,"The human ability to make inferences about the minds of conspecifics is remarkable. The majority of work in this area focuses on mental state representation ('theory of mind'), but has had limited success in explaining individual differences in this ability, and is characterized by the lack of a theoretical framework that can account for the effect of variability in the population of minds to which individuals are exposed. We draw analogies between faces and minds as complex social stimuli, and suggest that theoretical and empirical progress on understanding the mechanisms underlying mind representation can be achieved by adopting a 'Mind-space' framework; that minds, like faces, are represented within a multidimensional psychological space. This Mind-space framework can accommodate the representation of whole cognitive systems, and may help to explain individual differences in the consistency and accuracy with which the mental states of others are inferred. Mind-space may also have relevance for understanding human development, intergroup relations, and the atypical social cognition seen in several clinical conditions.",Association of high levels of plasma OX40 with acute adult T-cell leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652238,International journal of hematology,2019 03 06,"OX40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, co-stimulates activated T cells following interaction with its own ligand OX40L. Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). ATL cells are known to express cell surface OX40; however, the level of soluble OX40 (sOX40) in blood samples from ATL patients is unknown. Quantitative enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) showed that sOX40 levels were significantly higher in plasma from acute ATL patients than those from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and healthy donors, and correlated with sCD25 levels and HTLV-1 proviral loads in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Fresh PBMCs from acute ATL patients showed a higher percentage of OX40-positive cells compared with those from carriers, and shed sOX40 into culture supernatants. Shedding of sOX40 was partially inhibited by a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, GM6001. A fraction of sOX40 was capable of binding to OX40L. These results suggest that high levels of sOX40 are shed into blood from a large number of ATL cells in acute ATL patients. Thus, abnormally elevated plasma sOX40 levels may be useful as an additional diagnostic marker of acute ATL.",Harms of Workplace Inspections for Im/Migrant Sex Workers in In-Call Establishments: Enhanced Barriers to Health Access in a Canadian Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652237,Journal of immigrant and minority health,2019 02 16,"Given shifting sex work criminalization and enforcement in Canada, this study examined worrying about workplace inspections by authorities amongst indoor sex workers in Vancouver (2014-2017).

The results showed that aqueous ammonia pretreatment could modify chemical compositions, destroy rigid structure of the lignocellulosic substrate, increase enzymatic digestibility and change water state, which were beneficial to facilitate the fungus growth and nutrition utilization. Pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrate with aqueous ammonia at 80 °C gave the best effect on laccase production, yielding 172.74 U/g laccase at 14 days, which was 3.4 times higher than that of the control.

We conducted a cross-sectional study with the aid of a national sample of 1117 toddlers. Parents reported children's sleeping habits such as total sleep time and sleep onset latency, recreational activities, bedtime routines, and temperament. An ordered logistic regression was run to assess the associations between new media exposure and two sleep outcomes (total sleep time and sleep onset latency). Everyday use of a tablet or smartphone raised the odds of a shorter total sleep time (OR 1.95 [1.00-3.79], p < 0.05) and a longer sleep onset latency (OR 2.44 [1.26-4.73] p < 0.05) irrespective of other factors, such as temperament (restlessness, sociability), or traditional screen exposure (watching TV or playing videogames).Conclusion: New media usage is a factor associated in toddlers with sleeping fewer hours and taking longer to fall asleep, irrespective of other confounding factors.

The purpose of this study is to measure the dust fall and foliar transfer of heavy metals (viz., Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Mn) and antioxidant enzyme activities (peroxidase, catalase) in S. robusta, including the measurement of heavy metals present in the suspended particulate matter in ambient air. Dust fall on leaves and the total metal accumulation capacity of the plant were the highest during winter season with metal accumulation index of 9.82. Based on two-way ANOVA, it has been shown that there is a statistically significant difference in dust fall between the two forests and in different seasons. From cluster analysis, correlation results, and principal component analysis, it was suggested that heavy metals in Barjora may be due to the traffic emission and various industrial activities. Increased levels of peroxidase and catalase activities and the presence of high levels of reactive oxygen species in the leaves of the Barjora forest was an indication of stress state in this forest.

This might be due to its pH-dependent solubility or being a substrate of P-glycoprotein efflux pump. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were proposed in this study to enhance the oral absorption of AMS. AMS-NLCs were prepared by solvent evaporation technique according to (21.41.31) factorial design, whereas the type of solid lipid (tripalmitin or Gelucire® 43/1), lipid to drug ratio (7:1, 10:1, or 13:1) and type of external suspending medium (double distilled water, 0.5% TSP pH 12, 1% HPMC or 2.5% glycerin) were the independent variables. The average entrapment efficiency, particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of the prepared formulations ranged from 29.01 to 69.06%, 184.9 to 708.75 nm, 0.21 to 0.59, and - 21 to - 33.55 mV, respectively.

This study aims to describe the woody flora of Mozogo-Gokoro National Park, submitted to these geographical area constraints in the Far North of Cameroon. Global inventory of this flora is carried out, through three collection units representing strata in vegetation that are previously identified by photo-interpretation, with analyses focusing on compositional diversity parameters. Results show a very rich woody flora (110 woody plant species, for 46 genera and 30 families), having a quasi-typical Sudano-Sahelian physiognomy. Vegetation is mainly a shrubby dry forest, dominated by species such as Senegalia ataxacantha, Anogeissus leiocarpa, Tamarindus indica, Psorospermum senegalense, Clerodendrum capitatum, Celtis toka, and the botanical families of Fabaceae and Combretaceae. The diversity indices, the woody density, and the basal area are high (4.32 bits for the Shannon-Weaver index, 2694.16 stems/ha and 43.89 m2/ha). Despite the dominance of Sahelian individuals, the importance of Sudanian and Guinean species (more than 22.68% of species) brings vegetation closer to those of much humid areas. In wooded savanna collection unit, several values of the evaluated parameters are lower in comparison with those obtained in the two others.

The prepared tryptic digests from both caseinate and oligochitosan-glycated caseinate were assessed and compared for their effects on the intestinal barrier function of a cell model (IEC-6 cells). Both digests had similar chemical features in the nine amino acids (except for Met) and free amino group contents, but had different glucosamine contents. Both digests at 12.5-100 μg mL-1 promoted IEC-6 cell growth by 105.6-135.1% and more importantly improved intestinal epithelial barrier integrity via increasing trans-epithelial electrical resistance, decreasing paracellular permeability from 100% to 64.1-85.4%, reducing bacterial translocation, and enhancing antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The obtained qPCR and western-blot assay results also demonstrated that both digests had promoting effects on the expression levels of several tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. The oligochitosan-glycated caseinate digest always showed higher effects than the caseinate digest in the cells to retain the intestinal epithelial barrier function. This study thus highlights that the used TGase-type glycation endowed the oligochitosan-glycated caseinate with a potential functional food ingredient to strengthen the epithelial barrier function, which might be a helpful event to intestinal health.",Seven-enzyme in vitro cascade to (3R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652175,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 04 10,"Economical and environmentally-friendly routes to convert feedstock chemicals like acetate into valuable chiral products such as (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate are in demand.

The substituted diaryl 7-NHCs are the most sterically encumbered with large buried volume (%VB) values of 40-50% with the less flexible six-membered analogues having %VB values at least 5% smaller. Although the bicyclic systems containing fused 6- and 7-membered rings (6,7-NHCs) are constrained with relatively acute NCN bond angles, they have the largest %VB values of the dialkyl derivatives reported here, a feature related to the fixed conformation of the heterocyclic rings and the compressional effect of a pre-set methyl substituent.",Photoionization and dissociative photoionization of propynal in the gas phase: theory and experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652173,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 17,"Propynal (HCCCHO) is a complex organic compound (COM) of astrochemical and astrobiological interest. We present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on the single photon ionization of gas-phase propynal, in the 10 to 15.75 eV energy range. Fragmentation pathways of the resulting cation were investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) has been measured to be AIEexp = 10.715 ± 0.005 eV using tunable VUV synchrotron radiation coupled with a double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectrometer. In the energy range under study, three fragments formed by dissociative photoionization were identified experimentally: HC3O+, HCO+ and C2H2+, and their respective appearance energies (AE) were found to be AE = 11.26 ± 0.03, 13.4 ± 0.3 and 11.15 ± 0.03 eV, respectively. Using explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations and after inclusion of the zero point vibrational energy, core-valence and scalar relativistic effects, the AIE is calculated to be AIEcalc = 10.717 eV, in excellent agreement with the experimental finding. The appearance energies of the fragments were calculated using a similar methodological approach. To further interpret the observed vibrational structure, anharmonic frequencies were calculated for the fundamental electronic state of the propynal cation. Moreover, MRCI calculations were carried out to understand the population of excited states of the cationic species. This combined experimental and theoretical study will help to understand the presence and chemical evolution of propynal in the external parts of interstellar clouds where it has been observed.",Current and future biomarkers for risk-stratification and treatment personalisation in multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652172,Molecular omics,2019 06 07,"Multiple myeloma, an incurable malignancy of the plasma cells in the bone marrow, has a complex pathogenesis due to clonal heterogeneity.

This study investigates the effect of extrinsic wheat fibre (VITACEL® wheat fibre), which can be easily incorporated in many food products, on faecal bulk, stool pattern, gastrointestinal complaints, satiety and food liking. In a double-blind randomized crossover trial, healthy male volunteers received meal boxes for 10 days, containing various food products enriched with extrinsic wheat fibre (∼20 grams of additional fibre per day) or control food products containing conventional levels of fibre with similar taste, appearance and caloric values. Meal boxes were integrated in the normal dietary pattern. Stool frequency, stool consistency, gastrointestinal complaints, satiety and product liking were assessed daily, and the last 5 days of each intervention, participants collected all their faeces to analyse faecal bulk. We found that consumption of extrinsic wheat fibre-enriched products significantly enhanced faecal bulk; faecal wet and dry weight showed a 1.41 ± 0.1 and 1.55 ± 0.1 times increase compared to control, respectively (p < 0.01). Extrinsic wheat fibre intervention furthermore increased stool frequency (1.3 ± 0.1 defecations per day compared to 1.1 ± 0.1 defecations per day during control diet, p < 0.05), but did not affect stool consistency, satiety, gastrointestinal complaints or product liking. So, increased consumption of extrinsic wheat fibre enhances faecal bulk and stool frequency. As this extrinsic wheat fibre can be easily incorporated in many food products without affecting appearance or taste, it might facilitate the increase of overall fibre intake and subsequently improve (intestinal) health.",Organogels from trehalose difatty ester amphiphiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652170,Soft matter,2019 02 15,"Saccharide diesters have been recently shown to be excellent gelators of vegetable oils.

The resulting trehalose diesters demonstrated their ability to self-assemble in a large variety of edible vegetable oils with a minimum gelation concentration of 0.25 wt%/v. Microscopic analysis and X-ray scattering studies indicate that the gels are obtained by the self-assembly of trehalose diesters in crystalline fibers constituting the tridimensional network. The rheological study revealed that the properties of the gels depend on the kind of fatty acid grafted on the trehalose but are also influenced by the vegetable oil composition.",A density functional theory study of the hydrogenation and reduction of the thio-spinel Fe3S4{111} surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652169,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"The mineral greigite, Fe3S4, shows promising electro-reduction activity, especially towards carbon dioxide conversion to small organic molecules.

We have studied the adsorption, diffusion, surface reduction and associative (i.e. Volmer-Tafel mechanism) and molecular desorption of hydrogen as a function of its coverage. We found that (i) the H ad-atoms adsorb on S sites far from metallic centres in the topmost surface layer; (ii) the reduction of greigite by hydrogen is energetically unfavorable at any surface coverage; and (iii) molecular hydrogen evolution has a transition state at ∼0.5 eV above the energy of the reactants on Fe3S4{111}, which is very similar to the barrier found experimentally on Pt{111}.

Previous studies in fish and avian species showed that MC4R becomes an ACTH receptor after interaction with the melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2). We show that human MC4R behaves in a similar way through its interaction with MRAP2. This evolutionary conservation of MRAP2-induced ligand selectivity supports a physiological role for the interaction with MC4R. Both proteins are coexpressed in the same hypothalamic neurons, providing an anatomical substrate and molecular mechanism for the central therapeutic actions of ACTH in the treatment of infantile spasms. These neurons may link the effects of stress on the energy balance independently of glucocorticoid secretion. The complex MC4R-MRAP2 throws light on the action of ACTH and, by extension, on the relay of stress-related information to additional biological systems.",Is VTE Prophylaxis Necessary on Discharge for Patients Undergoing Adrenalectomy for Cushing Syndrome?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652131,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 01 20,"Patients with Cushing syndrome (CS) have an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Recent studies reported global changes in RNA editing in disease and development. Such widespread editing variations necessitate an improved understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of RNA editing. Here, we study the roles of >200 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in mediating RNA editing in two human cell lines. Using RNA-sequencing and global protein-RNA binding data, we identify a number of RBPs as key regulators of A-to-I editing. These RBPs, such as TDP-43, DROSHA, NF45/90 and Ro60, mediate editing through various mechanisms including regulation of ADAR1 expression, interaction with ADAR1, and binding to Alu elements. We highlight that editing regulation by Ro60 is consistent with the global up-regulation of RNA editing in systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, most key editing regulators act in a cell type-specific manner. Together, our work provides insights for the regulatory mechanisms of RNA editing.",Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators for imaging intracellular potassium ion concentration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652129,Communications biology,2019 01 20,"Potassium ion (K+) homeostasis and dynamics play critical roles in biological activities. Here we describe three genetically encoded K+ indicators. KIRIN1 (potassium (K) ion ratiometric indicator) and KIRIN1-GR are Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based indicators with a bacterial K+ binding protein (Kbp) inserting between the fluorescent protein FRET pairs mCerulean3/cp173Venus and Clover/mRuby2, respectively. GINKO1 (green indicator of K+ for optical imaging) is a single fluorescent protein-based K+ indicator constructed by insertion of Kbp into enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). These indicators are suitable for detecting K+ at physiologically relevant concentrations in vitro and in cells. KIRIN1 enabled imaging of cytosolic K+ depletion in live cells and K+ efflux and reuptake in cultured neurons. GINKO1, in conjunction with red fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, enable dual-color imaging of K+ and Ca2+ dynamics in neurons and glial cells. These results demonstrate that KIRIN1 and GINKO1 are useful tools for imaging intracellular K+ dynamics.",Heterochromatin suppresses gross chromosomal rearrangements at centromeres by repressing Tfs1/TFIIS-dependent transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652128,Communications biology,2019 01 20,"Heterochromatin, characterized by histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, assembles on repetitive regions including centromeres. Although centromeric heterochromatin is important for correct segregation of chromosomes, its exact role in maintaining centromere integrity remains elusive. Here, we found in fission yeast that heterochromatin suppresses gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) at centromeres. Mutations in Clr4/Suv39 methyltransferase increased the formation of isochromosomes, whose breakpoints were located in centromere repeats. H3K9A and H3K9R mutations also increased GCRs, suggesting that Clr4 suppresses centromeric GCRs via H3K9 methylation. HP1 homologs Swi6 and Chp2 and the RNAi component Chp1 were the chromodomain proteins essential for full suppression of GCRs. Remarkably, mutations in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) or Tfs1/TFIIS, the transcription factor that facilitates restart of RNAPII after backtracking, specifically bypassed the requirement of Clr4 for suppressing GCRs. These results demonstrate that heterochromatin suppresses GCRs by repressing Tfs1-dependent transcription of centromere repeats.",Optogenetic control of integrin-matrix interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652127,Communications biology,2019 01 20,"Optogenetic approaches have gathered momentum in precisely modulating and interrogating cellular signalling and gene expression. The use of optogenetics on the outer cell surface to interrogate how cells receive stimuli from their environment, however, has so far not reached its full potential. Here we demonstrate the development of an optogenetically regulated membrane receptor-ligand pair exemplified by the optically responsive interaction of an integrin receptor with the extracellular matrix. The system is based on an integrin engineered with a phytochrome-interacting factor domain (OptoIntegrin) and a red light-switchable phytochrome B-functionalized matrix (OptoMatrix). This optogenetic receptor-ligand pair enables light-inducible and -reversible cell-matrix interaction, as well as the controlled activation of downstream mechanosensory signalling pathways. Pioneering the application of optogenetic switches in the extracellular environment of cells, this OptoMatrix-OptoIntegrin system may serve as a blueprint for rendering matrix-receptor interactions amendable to precise control with light.",Insulin signaling in Drosophila melanogaster mediates Aβ toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652125,Communications biology,2019 01 20,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes are clinically positively correlated. However, the connection between them is not clarified. Here, using Drosophila as a model system, we show that reducing insulin signaling can effectively suppress the toxicity from Aβ (Amyloid beta 42) expression. On the other hand, Aβ accumulation led to the elevation of fly insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and activation of insulin signaling in the brain. Mechanistically, these observations are attributed to a reciprocal competition between Drosophila insulin-like peptides and Aβ for the activity of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). Intriguingly, peripheral insulin signaling is decreased despite its heightened activity in the brain. While many upstream factors may modify Aβ toxicity, our results suggest that insulin signaling is the main downstream executor of Aβ damage, and thus may serve as a promising target for Alzheimer's treatment in non-diabetes patients. This study explains why more Alzheimer's cases are found in diabetes patients.",Conventional analysis of movement on non-flat surfaces like the plasma membrane makes Brownian motion appear anomalous.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652124,Communications biology,2019 01 20,"Cells are neither flat nor smooth, which has serious implications for prevailing plasma membrane models and cellular processes like cell signalling, adhesion and molecular clustering. Using probability distributions from diffusion simulations, we demonstrate that 2D and 3D Euclidean distance measurements substantially underestimate diffusion on non-flat surfaces. Intuitively, the shortest within surface distance (SWSD), the geodesic distance, should reduce this problem. The SWSD is accurate for foldable surfaces but, although it outperforms 2D and 3D Euclidean measurements, it still underestimates movement on deformed surfaces. We demonstrate that the reason behind the underestimation is that topographical features themselves can produce both super- and subdiffusion, i.e. the appearance of anomalous diffusion. Differentiating between topography-induced and genuine anomalous diffusion requires characterising the surface by simulating Brownian motion on high-resolution cell surface images and a comparison with the experimental data.",Registration bias in a clinical quality register.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652120,Endoscopy international open,2019 01 20,"Background and aims  The quality of medical quality registers is poorly defined and lack of trust in data due to low completeness may be a major barrier against their use in quality improvement interventions. The aim of the current observational study was to explore how selective reporting may influence adverse events registered in the Norwegian quality register for colonoscopy (Gastronet). Materials and methods  Gastronet's database includes data provided by endoscopists, nurses and patients. All outpatient colonoscopies reported to Gastronet in 2015 were included and compared to the total number of colonoscopies performed in Norway as retrieved from the National Patient Registry. Hospitals were categorized into four groups according to reporting completeness < 50 %, 50 % to 69 %, 70 % to 89 % and ≥ 90 %. The number of recorded adverse events (AEs) and procedure time were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to explore independent factors for selection bias. Results  A total of 22,364 colonoscopies were reported to the National Patient Register of which 15,855 (71 %) were registered in Gastronet. Feedback was received from 11,079 patients (50 %). The frequency of AEs increased from 0.6 % in completeness group < 50 % to 1.6 % in completeness group ≥ 90 % ( P  < 0.001). Long colonoscopy procedure time was associated with low reporting completeness. Patient feedback was associated with older age, cecal intubation success and sedation-free colonoscopy. Conclusion  Incomplete registration in a colonoscopy quality register is associated with underreporting of AEs. Longer procedure time, a surrogate marker for time constraint, is associated with low completeness.",The effect of antimicrobial additives on the properties of dental glass-ionomer cements: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652117,Acta biomaterialia odontologica Scandinavica,2019 01 20,"Aim: The aim of this article is to review the literature on the use of antimicrobial additives in glass-ionomer dental cements. Method: An electronic search between 1987 and the end of 2017 was performed using PubMed, Web of Science and Google search engines with the terms glass-ionomer, glass polyalkenoate, antibacterial and antimicrobial as the key words. The search was refined by excluding the majority of references concerned with cement antimicrobial properties only. Extra papers already known to the authors were added to those considered. Results: A total of 92 relevant articles have been cited in the review of which 55 are specifically concerned with the enhancement of antibacterial properties of glass-ionomers, both conventional and resin-modified, with additives. In addition, information is included on the uses of glass-ionomers and the biological properties of the antibacterial additives employed. There are several reports that show that additives are typically released by diffusion, and that a high proportion is usually left behind, trapped in the cement. Additives generally increase setting times of cements, and reduce mechanical properties. However, smaller amounts of additive have only slight effects and the longer-term durability of cements appears unaffected. Conclusion: Modified glass-ionomer cements seem to be acceptable for clinical use, especially in the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) technique."

From these, relatively few amyloid structures can be identified, since amyloids are insoluble in water. Therefore, most amyloid structures deposited in the PDB are in the form of solid state NMR data. Based on the geometric analysis of these deposited structures, we have prepared an automatically updated web server, which generates a list of the deposited amyloid structures, and also entries of globular proteins that have amyloid-like substructures of given size and characteristics. We have found that by applying only appropriately selected geometric conditions, it is possible to identify deposited amyloid structures and a number of globular proteins with amyloid-like substructures. We have analyzed these globular proteins and have found proof in the literature that many of them form amyloids more easily than many other globular proteins. Our results relate to the method of Stanković et al. [Stanković I et al. (2017) IPSI BgD Tran Int Res 13, 47-51], who applied a hybrid textual-search and geometric approach for finding amyloids in the PDB. If one intends to identify a subset of the PDB for certain applications, the identification algorithm needs to be re-run periodically, since in 2017 on average 30 new entries per day were deposited in the data bank. Our web server is updated regularly and automatically, and the identified amyloid and partial amyloid structures can be viewed or their list can be downloaded from the following website https://pitgroup.org/amyloid.",Chloride promotes refolding of active Vibrio alkaline phosphatase through an inactive dimeric intermediate with an altered interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652084,FEBS open bio,2019 01 20,"Most enzymes are homodimers or higher order multimers. Cold-active alkaline phosphatase from Vibrio splendidus (VAP) transitions into a dimer with very low activity under mild denaturation conditions. The desire to understand why this dimer fails to efficiently catalyse phosphomonoester hydrolysis led us to investigate interfacial communication between subunits. Here, we studied in detail the unfolding mechanism at two pH values and in the presence or absence of sodium chloride. At pH 8.0, the denaturation model had to include an inactive dimer intermediate and follow the pathway: N2 → I2 → 2U. At pH 10.5, the model was of a two-state nature. Enzyme activity was not recovered under several examined refolding conditions. However, in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, the enzyme was nearly fully reactivated after urea treatment. Thermal inactivation experiments were biphasic where the inactivation could be detected using CD spectroscopy at 190-200 nm. By incorporating a bimane fluorescence probe at the dimer interface, we could monitor inactivation/denaturation at two distinct sites at the dimer interface. A change in bimane fluorescence at both sites was observed during inactivation, but prior to the global unfolding event. Furthermore, the rate of change in bimane fluorescence correlated with inactivation rates at 40 °C. These results indicate and support the hypothesis that the subunits of VAP are only functional in the dimeric state due to the cooperative nature of the reaction mechanism when proper crosstalk between subunits is facilitated.",Coprs inactivation leads to a derepression of LINE1 transposons in spermatocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652083,FEBS open bio,2019 04 03,"Repression of retrotransposons is essential for genome integrity during germ cell development and is tightly controlled through epigenetic mechanisms. In primordial germ cells, protein arginine N-methyltransferase (Prmt5) is involved in retrotransposon repression by methylating Piwi proteins, which is part of the piRNA pathway. Here, we show that in mice, genetic inactivation of coprs (which is highly expressed in testis and encodes a histone-binding protein required for the targeting of Prmt5 activity) affects the maturation of spermatogonia to spermatids. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of Miwi in testis protein lysates immunoprecipitated with an anti-Coprs antibody. The observed deregulation of Miwi and pachytene pre-piRNAs levels and the derepression of LINE1 repetitive sequences observed in coprs-/- mice suggest that Coprs is implicated in genome surveillance mechanisms.",The potential roles of long non-coding RNAs in lipopolysaccharide-induced human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as determined by microarray analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652082,FEBS open bio,2019 01 20,"Sepsis arises from an aberrant and excessive host response to infection. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in multiple cellular functions, including inflammation and immunity. However, to date there has been no systematic attempt to identify lncRNAs whose expression is changed after the induction of the innate immune response. In this study, we profiled global lncRNA and mRNA expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using a microarray platform. Of the 40 914 lncRNAs screened, 596 were significantly upregulated and 250 were significantly downregulated (corrected P < 0.05) in response to LPS. Of the 34 236 mRNAs screened, 802 were upregulated and 549 were downregulated. Functional annotation analysis indicated that lncRNA-associated differentially expressed mRNAs were primarily enriched in host immune and inflammatory responses. This study provides the first lncRNA and mRNA transcriptomic landscape of LPS-mediated changes in human PBMCs. These findings may provide potential insights into lncRNAs involved in the immunopathology of sepsis.",Inhibins regulate peripheral regulatory T cell induction through modulation of dendritic cell function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652081,FEBS open bio,2019 01 20,"We have previously reported that the absence of inhibins results in impaired dendritic cell (DC) maturation and function, leading to decreased T cell activation and diminished delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. Here, we investigated the role of inhibins in peripheral regulatory T cell (Treg) induction in vitro and in vivo. Inhibin deficient (Inhα-/-) mice showed an increased percentage of peripherally induced Tregs in colonic lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes, compared to Inhα+/+ mice, which correlated with increased expression of PD-L1 in CD103+ and CD8α+ DCs. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived and ex vivo spleen- and lymph node-purified CD11c+ Inhα-/- DCs induced higher Tregs in vitro. Moreover, in vivo anti-DEC205-ovalbumin (OVA) DC targeting of mice with adoptively transferred OVA-specific T cells showed enhanced induced peripheral Treg conversion in Inhα-/- mice. These data identify inhibins as key regulators of peripheral T cell tolerance.",Presence of O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides in the cell wall mannan of Candida krusei purified with Benanomicin A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652080,FEBS open bio,2019 01 20,"Cell wall mannan of the pathogenic yeast Candida krusei was prepared using the antibiotic Benanomicin A, which has a lectin-like function. The chemical structure of this molecule was found to be similar to that of mannan prepared from the same yeast by the conventional method using Fehling reagent. Only a few degradation products were detected when the mannan prepared using Fehling reagent was subjected to alkali treatment (β-elimination), but multiple α-1,2-linked oligosaccharides were detected when the mannan purified with Benanomicin A was treated with alkali. These results indicate that most of the O-linked sugar chains in mannan were lost under conventional conditions when exposed to the strongly alkaline Fehling reagent. In contrast, the O-glycosidic bond in mannan was not cleaved and the O-linked sugar chains were maintained and almost intact following treatment with the mild novel preparation method using Benanomicin A. Therefore, we argue that the new mannan preparation method using Benanomicin A is superior to conventional methods. In addition, our study suggests that some yeast mannans, whose overall structure has already been reported, may contain more O-linked sugar chains than previously recognized.",Uncommon properties of lipid biosynthesis of isolated plastids in the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652079,FEBS open bio,2019 01 20,"Red algae are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that diverged from green algae over one billion years ago, and have various traits distinct from those of both green algae and land plants. Although most red algae are marine species (both unicellular and macrophytic), the Cyanidiales class of red algae includes unicellular species which live in hot springs, such as Cyanidioschyzon merolae, which is a model species for biochemical and molecular biological studies. Lipid metabolism in red algae has previously been studied in intact cells. Here, we present the results of radiolabeling and stable isotope labeling experiments in intact plastids isolated from the unicellular red alga C. merolae. We focused on two uncommon features: First, the galactose moiety of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol was efficiently labeled with bicarbonate, indicating that an unknown pathway for providing UDP-galactose exists within the plastid. Second, saturated fatty acids, namely, palmitic and stearic acids, were the sole products of fatty acid synthesis in the plastid, and they were efficiently exported. This finding suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is the sole site of desaturation. We present a general principle of red algal lipid biosynthesis, namely, 'indigenous C18 fatty acids are neither desaturated nor directly utilized within the plastid'. We believe that this is valid in both C. merolae lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids and marine red algae with a high content of arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids.",Heat induces myogenic transcription factors of myoblast cells via transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (Trpv1).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652078,FEBS open bio,2019 01 20,"Exercise generates heat, blood flow, and metabolic changes, thereby inducing hypertrophy of skeletal muscle cells. However, the mechanism by which heat incudes hypertrophy in response to heat is not well known. Here, we hypothesized that heat would induce differentiation of myoblast cells. We investigated the underlying mechanism by which myoblast cells respond to heat. When mouse myoblast cells were exposed to 42 °C for over 30 min, the phosphorylation level of protein kinase C (PKC) and heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) increased, and the mRNA and protein expression level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) increased. Inhibitors of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (Trpv1), calmodulin, PKC, and Hsf1, and the small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Trpv1 diminished those heat responses. Heat exposure increased the phosphorylation levels of thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (Eif4ebp1), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1 (S6K1). The knockdown of Trpv1 decreased these heat-induced responses. Antagonists of Hsp70 inhibited the phosphorylation level of Akt. Finally, heat increased the protein expression level of skeletal muscle markers such as myocyte enhancer factor 2D, myogenic factor 5, myogenic factor 6, and myogenic differentiation 1. Heat also increased myotube formation. Knockdown of Trpv1 diminished heat-induced increases of those proteins and myotube formation. These results indicate that heat induces myogenic transcription factors of myoblast cells through the Trpv1, calmodulin, PKC, Hsf1, Hsp70, Akt, mTOR, Eif4ebp1, and S6K1 pathway. Moreover, heat increases myotube formation through Trpv1."

Clinically, prolonged use of flupirtine as a pain medication is associated with rare cases of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, safety concerns prevent a broader use of this non-opioid and non-steroidal analgesic in therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs such as hyperactive bladder or neonatal seizures. With the goal of studying influences of chemical structure on activity and toxicity of flupirtine, we explored modifications of the benzylamino bridge and the substitution pattern in both rings of flupirtine. Among twelve derivatives, four novel thioether derivatives showed the desired activity in cellular assays and may serve as leads for safer KV channel openers.","Development of XIAP Antagonists Based On De Novo 8,5-Fused Bicyclic Lactams.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652062,ChemistryOpen,2019 04 18,"In order to develop original water soluble antagonists of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a novel bicyclic scaffold was designed based on 8,5-fused bicyclic lactam. During its preparation, a spontaneous rearrangement from 8,5- to 7,5-fused bicyclic lactam was observed and confirmed by MS and NMR analyses, in particular the HMBC spectra. DFT calculations were performed to understand the corresponding mechanism. It was finally prevented through changing the reaction order in the synthesis route and a Smac mimetic with this core structure, ZJ-1 was successfully obtained. The structure of this new bicyclic scaffold was well confirmed by HRMS and NMR (1H, 13C, NOESY) analyses. ZJ-1 presented in addition a binding affinity to XIAP-BIR3, nearly 6 times better than that of AVPI, similar to the reported SM-128 in an in vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. This preliminary result suggests that this new bicyclic scaffold could be very attractive in the development of novel anticancer agents targeting XIAP.","Homophtalonitrile for Multicomponent Reactions: Syntheses and Optical Properties of o-Cyanophenyl- or Indol-3-yl-Substituted Chromeno[2,3-c]isoquinolin-5-Amines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652060,ChemistryOpen,2019 01 20,"Malononitrile is a useful reagent for multicomponent reactions with hundreds of methods developed.

Individual needs and circumstances vary greatly and one size fit all solutions do not tend to work well. More tailored solutions centred on individuals' needs and circumstances can be developed in collaboration with these individuals. This process, known as co-creation, has shown promise but it requires guiding principles to improve its effectiveness. The aim of this study was to identify a key set of principles and recommendations for co-creating public health interventions.Methods: These principles were collaboratively developed through analysing a set of case studies targeting different health behaviours (such as reducing sitting and improving strength and balance) in different groups of people (such as adolescent schoolgirls and older adults living in the community).Results: The key principles of co-creation are presented in four stages: Planning (what is the purpose of the co-creation; and who should be involved?); Conducting (what activities can be used during co-creation; and how to ensure buy-in and commitment?); Evaluating (how do we know the process and the outcome are valid and effective?) and Reporting (how to report the findings?).

However, to reach an ideal manufactural efficiency, it is necessary to optimize the microbial cell factories systemically by boosting sufficient carbon flux to the precursor synthesis and tuning the expression level and efficiency of key bioparts related to the synthetic pathway. We previously developed a yeast cell factory to produce ginsenoside Rh2 from glucose. However, the ginsenoside Rh2 yield was too low for commercialization due to the low supply of the ginsenoside aglycone protopanaxadiol (PPD) and poor performance of the key UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) (biopart UGTPg45) in the final step of the biosynthetic pathway. In the present study, we constructed a PPD-producing chassis via modular engineering of the mevalonic acid pathway and optimization of P450 expression levels. The new yeast chassis could produce 529.0 mg/L of PPD in shake flasks and 11.02 g/L in 10 L fed-batch fermentation. Based on this high PPD-producing chassis, we established a series of cell factories to produce ginsenoside Rh2, which we optimized by improving the C3-OH glycosylation efficiency. We increased the copy number of UGTPg45, and engineered its promoter to increase expression levels. In addition, we screened for more efficient and compatible UGT bioparts from other plant species and mutants originating from the direct evolution of UGTPg45. Combining all engineered strategies, we built a yeast cell factory with the greatest ginsenoside Rh2 production reported to date, 179.3 mg/L in shake flasks and 2.25 g/L in 10 L fed-batch fermentation. The results set up a successful example for improving yeast cell factories to produce plant rare natural products, especially the glycosylated ones.",Coxsackievirus A10 atomic structure facilitating the discovery of a broad-spectrum inhibitor against human enteroviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652025,Cell discovery,2019 01 20,"Coxsackievirus A10 (CV-A10) belongs to the Enterovirus species A and is a causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Ninety students, before a 45-minute lecture, were randomized into three groups - sham (S), low (LF), and high fidelity (HF) simulation - to participate in an interactive simulation session. To evaluate immediate and long-lasting retention, a 20-item structured questionnaire on inotropic agents was administered to 90 students before and after a 45-minute lecture, after simulation, and 3 months later. In all groups, the rate of correct answers increased after lecture, while no difference was observed between different groups (P = 0.543).

Traditionally, lesion boundary segmentation is first adopted and then classification is conducted, to reach the judgment of benign or malignant tumor. In addition, sonograms often contain much speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneity. This study proposes a novel benign or malignant tumor classification system, which comprises intensity inhomogeneity correction and stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE), and it is suitable for small-size dataset. A classifier is established by extracting features in the multilayer training of SDAE; automatic analysis of imaging features by the deep learning algorithm is applied on image classification, thus allowing the system to have high efficiency and robust distinguishing. In this study, two kinds of dataset (private data and public data) are used for deep learning models training. For each dataset, two groups of test images are compared: the original images and the images after intensity inhomogeneity correction, respectively. The results show that when deep learning algorithm is applied on the sonograms after intensity inhomogeneity correction, there is a significant increase of the tumor distinguishing accuracy. This study demonstrated that it is important to use preprocessing to highlight the image features and further give these features for deep learning models. In this way, the classification accuracy will be better to just use the original images for deep learning.",The Effect of Kinesiology Taping on the Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651946,Journal of healthcare engineering,2019 01 20,"The purpose of the study was to explore the effect of kinesiology taping on hemiplegic shoulder pain (HSP) in terms of pain intensity, magnitude of subluxation, muscle activity, and active range of motion (AROM).",IT-Enabled Clinical Decision Support: An Empirical Study on Antecedents and Mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651945,Journal of healthcare engineering,2019 01 20,"Modern hospitals increasingly make use of innovations and information technology (IT) to improve workflow and patient's clinical journey. Typical innovative solutions include patient records and clinical decision support systems to enhance the process of decision making by doctors and other healthcare practitioners. However, currently, it remains unclear how hospitals could facilitate and enable such a decision support capability in clinical practice. We ground our work on the resource-based view of the firm and put forth the notion of IT-enabled capabilities which emphasizes critical IT investment and capability development areas that hospitals could exploit in their quest to improve clinical decision support. We develop a research model that explains how ""health information exchange"" and enhanced ""information capability"" collectively drive a hospital's ""clinical decision support capability."" We used partial least squares path modeling on large-scale cross-sectional data from 720 European hospitals. Outcomes suggest that health information exchange positively impacts information capability. In turn, information capability complementary partially mediates the relationship between information exchange and clinical decision support. Hence, this research contributes to the literature on clinical decision support and provides valuable insights into how to support such innovative technologies and capabilities in clinical practice.

Binarisation, morphological operations, and geometric transformations are applied in cascade to automatically extract the required data from 44 predefined regions of interest. The implemented algorithms for region extraction were tested on data from 395 participants. A correct extraction in around 90% of the images was achieved. The process of automatically extracting 44 regions of interest was performed in a total computation time of approximately 1 minute, a substantial improvement over 10 minutes it took for a corresponding manual extraction of the regions by a trained individual. Interrater reliability tests showed that the automatically extracted ROIs are similar to those extracted by humans with minimal temperature difference. This set of algorithms provides a sufficiently accurate and reliable method for temperature extraction from thermal images at par with human raters with a tenfold reduction in time requirement. The automated process may replace the manual human extraction, leading to a faster process, making it feasible to carry out large-scale studies and to increase the regions of interest with minimal cost.

However, neither the theory nor practise of economic evaluation satisfactorily reflect social values. Both are primarily concerned with efficiency, commonly conceptualised as the maximisation of utility or quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The focus is upon the service and the benefits obtained from it. This has resulted in an evaluation methodology which discriminates against groups and treatments which the population would like to prioritise. This includes high cost treatments for patients with rare diseases. In contrast with prevailing methods, there is increasing evidence that the public would prefer a fairness-focused framework in which the service was removed from centre stage and replaced by the patient. However methods for achieving fairness are ad hoc and under-developed. The article initially reviews the theory of economic evaluation and argues that its focus upon individual utility and efficiency as defined by the theory omits potentially important social values. Some empirical evidence relating to population values is presented and four studies by the first author are reviewed. These indicate that when people adopt the social perspective of a citizen they have a preference for sharing the health budget in a way which does not exclude patients who require services that are not cost effective, such as orphan medicinal products (OMP's) and treatments for patients with ultra-rare diseases (URD's).","Comparison of small extracellular vesicles isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation or size-exclusion chromatography: yield, purity and functional potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651940,Journal of extracellular vesicles,2019 01 20,"Interest in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) as functional carriers of proteins and nucleic acids is growing continuously. There are large numbers of sEVs in the blood, but lack of standardised methods for sEV isolation greatly limits our ability to study them. In this report, we use rat plasma to systematically compare two commonly used techniques for isolation of sEVs: ultracentrifugation (UC-sEVs) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-sEVs). SEC-sEVs had higher particle number, protein content, particle/protein ratios and sEV marker signal than UC-sEVs. However, SEC-sEVs also contained greater amounts of APOB+ lipoproteins and large quantities of non-sEV protein. sEV marker signal correlated very well with both particle number and protein content in UC-sEVs but not in all of the SEC-sEV fractions. Functionally, both UC-sEVs and SEC-sEVs isolates contained a variety of proangiogenic factors (with endothelin-1 being the most abundant) and stimulated migration of endothelial cells. However, there was no evident correlation between the promigratory potential and the quantity of sEVs added, indicating that non-vesicular co-isolates may contribute to the promigratory effects. Overall, our findings suggest that UC provides plasma sEVs of lower yields, but markedly higher purity compared to SEC. Furthermore, we show that the functional activity of sEVs can depend on the isolation method used and does not solely reflect the sEV quantity. These findings are of importance when working with sEVs isolated from plasma- or serum-containing conditioned medium.",Quality of extracellular vesicle images by transmission electron microscopy is operator and protocol dependent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651939,Journal of extracellular vesicles,2019 01 20,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has nanometre resolution and can be used to distinguish single extracellular vesicles (EVs) from non-EV particles. TEM images of EVs are a result of operator image selection. To which extent operator image selection reflects the overall sample quality, and to which extent the images are comparable and reproducible, is unclear. In a first attempt to improve the comparability and reproducibility of TEM to visualise EVs, we compared operator image selection to images taken at predefined locations from the same grids, using four EV TEM preparation protocols, a single EV-containing sample and a single TEM instrument. Operator image selection leads to high-quality images that are more similar between the protocols. In contrast, images taken at predefined locations reveal differences between the protocols, for example in number of EVs per image and background quality. From the evaluated protocols, for only one protocol the operator image selection is comparable to the TEM images taken at predefined locations. Taken together, operator image selection can be used to demonstrate the presence of EVs in a sample, but seem less suitable to demonstrate the quality of a sample. Because images taken at predefined locations reflect the overall quality of the EV-containing sample rather than the presence of EVs alone, this is a first step to improve the comparability and reproducibility of TEM for monitoring the quality of EV-containing samples.","Radioresistance of cancer cells, integrin αvβ3 and thyroid hormone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651936,Oncotarget,2019 01 20,"Radioresistance is a substantial barrier to success in cancer management.

We have shown experimentally that the thyroid hormone analogue receptor on the extracellular domain of integrin αvβ3 may modulate the state of radiosensitivity of tumor cells. Specifically, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a derivative of L-thyroxine (T4), can reduce radioresistance in cancer cells. In this review, we list a number of intrinsic signal transduction molecules and other host factors that have been reported to support/induce radioresistance in cancer cells and that are also subject to control by T4 through actions primarily initiated at integrin αvβ3. Additional preclinical evidence is needed to support these radioresistance-relevant actions of thyroid hormone.",Metformin alters H2A.Z dynamics and regulates androgen dependent prostate cancer progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651935,Oncotarget,2019 01 20,"Epigenetic mechanisms involved in prostate cancer include hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, general hypomethylation of the genome, and alterations in histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs). In addition, over expression of the histone variant H2A.Z as well as deregulated expression of Polycomb group proteins including EZH2 have been well-documented. Recent evidence supports a role for metformin in prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. However, the mechanism of action of metformin in PCa is poorly understood. We provide data showing that metformin epigenetically targets PCa by altering the levels and gene binding dynamics of histone variant H2A.Z. Moreover, we show that the increase in H2A.Z upon metformin treatment occurs preferentially due to H2A.Z.1 isoform. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-RT PCR analysis indicates that metformin treatment results in an increased H2A.Z occupancy on the androgen receptor (AR) and AR-regulated genes that is more prominent in the androgen dependent AR positive LNCaP cells. Repression of H2A.Z.1 gene by siRNA-mediated knock down identified this H2A.Z isoform to be responsible. Based on preliminary data with an EZH2-specific inhibitor, we suggest that the effects of metformin on the early stages of PCa may involve both EZH2 and H2A.Z through the alteration of different molecular pathways."

These associations remain unexplored in well-differentiated, metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. We have assessed the effect on tumor response at 6 months, overall survival, progression-free survival and safety of 14 SNPs, and 6 soluble proteins. Forty-three patients were recruited. Two SNPs in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) gene predicted lower overall survival: rs307826 with hazard ratio (HR) 3.67 (confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.35-10.00) and rs307821 with HR 3.84 (CI 95%, 1.47-10.0). Interleukin-6 was associated with increased mortality: HR 1.06 (CI 95%, 1.01-1.12), and osteopontin was associated with shorter PFS: HR 1.087 (1.01-1.16), independently of Ki-67. Furthermore, levels of osteopontin remained higher at the end of the study in patients considered non-responders: 38.5 ng/mL vs. responders: 18.7 ng/mL, p-value=0.039.

The CT appearances, together with the clinical features, were highly suspicious for an infiltrative type of gastric malignancy. Endoscopic biopsy however showed erosive inflammation, IgG4 plasmacytosis and fibrosis, raising the possibility of IgG4-related disease. A serologic assay for IgG showed normal IgG4 and elevated IgG2 serum levels. After appropriate steroid treatment, endoscopy and CT scan showed resolution of the ulcer and gastric wall thickening. This case shows yet another possible appearance of gastric involvement in IgG4-related disease on the current evolving spectrum of this disease presentation.

Allergic symptoms, serum IgE, and food antigen-specific IgE were measured. A mouse allergy model was established by using shrimp tropomyosin and treated with B. lactis. Relative mRNA levels of Treg- and Th17-associated cytokines were measured by using quantitative PCR. The percentage of Treg and Th17 cells in spleen were measured by using flow cytometry. After 3-month therapy, the allergic symptoms of the BG were remarkably reduced when compared with the CG (P < 0.05). Serum levels of IgE and food antigen-specific IgE were decreased too (P < 0.05). Similar results were also found in a mouse allergy model. After B. lactis treatment, the relative mRNA level of FoxP3 was significantly enhanced in the B. lactis therapy group when compared to positive controls. In addition, relative mRNA levels of FoxP3 and TGF-β associated with Treg cells were increased, whereas relative mRNA levels of IL-17A and IL-23 associated with Th17 were reduced.

The discussion makes clear that C. elegans is its own best model for revealing, via genetic approaches, biological principles of nutritional behavior, and the biochemical function of vitamins. In this case, the model has a discovery function. Worm research serves also in the identification of nutrition-dependent pathways that could be used for novel approaches in human nutritional studies. This heuristic function of the model guides the applied nutrition research in an innovative direction. Since the nutrition and metabolism for the worm and man differ from each other somewhat strongly, results of nutritional studies in C. elegans are not directly applicable to human nutrition. In general, the C. elegans model is primarily appropriate for explaining the causality of general species' nutritional phenotypes. Experience tells us that the analysis of drastic nutritional phenotypes in C. elegans has the potential to enrich the canon of knowledge of nutritional science."

Relevant studies were retrieved by searching the PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and, Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals databases using a combination of key words, including 'central retinal vein obstruction', 'CRVO', 'laser' and 'panretinal photocoagulation'. The titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by two independent reviewers and studies were selected according to specific inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and the quality of each study was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation or Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. A total of 1,187 abstracts were retrieved, and finally, 11 clinical studies were selected, including 534 cases of CRVO. Of these, 8 studies compared the efficacy of laser therapy with other treatments for CRVO, two studies compared the efficacy of laser therapy and drug treatment for CRVO and one study compared the efficacy of early laser therapy with standard laser therapy (regular examinations and laser therapy performed as soon as neovascularization was identified) for CRVO. Among them, the results of five studies demonstrated that panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for the prevention of iris neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma is inefficient regarding the improvement of visual acuity. A total of 10 studies indicated that laser therapy achieved better outcomes in neovascularization of the retina, optic disc neovascularization and iris neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, changes in the visual field, macular edema, macular thickness and intraocular pressure. Of note, it was indicated that laser photocoagulation prevents the severe vascular complications of CRVO. In addition, in the eyes of patients receiving PRP for the treatment of ischemic CRVO, significant reductions in corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters and average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness were observed. Furthermore, laser photocoagulation was able to increase retinal blood flow in eyes with ischemic CRVO.",lncRNA DGCR5 acts as a tumor suppressor in papillary thyroid carcinoma via sequestering miR-2861.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651878,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"A vast amount of evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in cancer. Previous studies have indicated that lncRNA DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5 (DGCR5) is aberrantly expressed in lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of DGCR5 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has remained elusive. In the present study, it was revealed that DGCR5 was significantly downregulated in PTC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. Through functional experiments, it was demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of DGCR5 markedly suppressed PTC cell growth and invasion. A bioinformatics analysis suggested that DGCR5 binds to microRNA (miR)-2861. A total of 5 putative binding sites for miR-2861 were identified in DGCR5, and a luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct interaction between DGCR5 and miR-2861. Furthermore, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that ectopic overexpression of DGCR5 led to a decreased expression of miR-2861 in PTC cells and miR-2861 mimic transfection caused a downregulation of DGCR5. miR-2861 level was upregulated in PTC tissues compared with adjacent tissues and negatively correlated with DGCR5 level. In addition, rescue experiments indicated that ectopic expression of miR-2861 reversed the effects of DGCR5 overexpression on PTC cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, the present results demonstrated that DGCR5 inhibits PTC progression via sponging miR-2861, indicating DGCR5 may serve as a therapeutic target.",Clinical outcomes of patients with primary malignant bone and soft tissue tumor aged 65 years or older.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651877,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"The number of elderly patients with sarcoma (65 years or older) has increased with the rise in the aging of society. As it is difficult to treat elderly sarcoma patients in the same manner as younger patients, the present study sought to compare treatment options currently available for elderly patients. The present study was comprised 34 Japanese patients (21 men and 13 women) with malignant bone or soft tissue tumors who underwent surgery in our department from September 2004 to March 2014. The median patient age was 72 years (range, 65-86 years). Histologically, 23 cases were categorized as high-grade and 11 as low-grade. Treatments included surgery with adequate margins (25 cases), surgery with inadequate margins and radiotherapy (4 cases), surgery with inadequate margins and chemotherapy (3 cases) and intralesional resection (2 cases). The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 7 to 112 months (average, 49 months). The 5-year survival rates were determined and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) and Anesthesiologists-Physical Status (ASA-PS) scores were also determined. The overall 5-year survival rate was 86.02%; it differed significantly between patients with high-grade (100%) vs. low-grade (74.3%) neoplasms P<0.001), but not between patients aged 65-69 (76.9%) vs. ≥70 (90.2%) years-old (P=0.65). Tumor status was classified as follows: i) Continuously disease-free, n=24 cases; ii) alive with disease, n=3 cases; iii) and dead of disease, n=7 cases. The ECOG-PS status scores were 0 in 9 cases, 1 in 21 cases, and 2 in 4 cases. ASA-PS scores were also I in 9 cases and II in 23 cases. Thus, the primary treatment for elderly patients with sarcoma should be surgery alone as no additional benefits were obtained when radiotherapy or chemotherapy was also performed.

The serum IgG4 titer in 9 patients ranged from 4.58 to 46.70 g/l (reference value, 0.03-2.01 g/l), with an average value of 21.93±2.18 g/l. Notably, the degree of increase in the 9 patients with IgG4-RODs was different, but all were >1.35 g/l. A total of 6 cases of infraorbital nerve thickening were observed. In addition, there were 3 cases of extraocular muscle thickening and 1 patient with IgG4-ROD had an orbital tissue lesion extending along the inferior temporal septum to the left pterygopalatine fossa, with left sacral fissure widening and involvement of the left maxillary sinus. The study revealed that the thickening of the inferior orbital nerve may be a characteristic of IgG4-ROD. Therefore, on the basis of biopsy and serological examination in the clinic, early diagnosis can be combined with imaging examination, clinical manifestation and laboratory examination, so as to reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.",Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy in the treatment of senior patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651875,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"The aim of the current study was to analyze the efficacy of percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease for senior patients.

Parameters were analyzed, including surgery time, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, visual analog scale (VAS) and Japan Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores. Compared with the open surgery group, the surgery time and intraoperative blood loss were decreased, while the intraoperative fluoroscopy time was increased, in the PTED group (P<0.001). Significant improvements in VAS and JOA scores were identified within both groups from preoperative to 12 months following surgery (P<0.001). VAS and JOA scores were significantly improved in the PTEN group compared with the open surgery group at 1 week after surgery (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference between groups prior to and at 12 months following surgery. The incidence of venous thrombosis of the lower extremities in the PTED group was decreased compared with the open surgery group (P<0.05). In the open surgery group, patients suffered from multiple postoperative complications, including constipation, urinary system infection, wound infection, gastrointestinal hemorrhagic stress ulcer, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, mortality following myocardial infarction, mortality following cerebral infarction, and hemiplegia following cerebral hemorrhage. By contrast, patients in the PTED group did not experience any of these complications. In conclusion, PTED resulted in reduced trauma and a lower incidence of severe complications compared with open surgery, which suggests that PTED is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgery for senior patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease.",Post-operative outcomes associated with Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis implantation in Northeast China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651874,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the post-operative outcomes associated with Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis (Kpro-1) implantation in the treatment of patients with corneal blindness in Northeast China. Clinical data of patients who had undergone Kpro-1 implantation between July 2010 and November 2014 were retrospectively collected. The visual performance, implant retention and post-surgical complications were recorded for each patient. A total of 20 patients (20 eyes) with corneal blindness were included in the study. Prior to surgery, the patients exhibited poor vision and decreased levels of light perception. At 3 days, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years post-surgery, logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution values were significantly decreased compared with the pre-operative values. The initial Kpro-1 implants were retained in 16 eyes. Regarding the post-operative complications, six patients exhibited retroprosthetic membrane formation, two patients presented with endophthalmitis, two patients developed secondary glaucoma, two patients experienced optical cylinder detachment, two patients presented with corneal melting, three patients had retinal detachment, three patients developed corneal ulcers and one patient had secondary optic neuropathy. Overall, the results of the present study suggested that implantation with Kpro-1 may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients following previously failed keratoplasty in Northeast China. Serious complications associated with Kpro-1 implantation are common, and thus, suitable patient selection, continuous follow-up and early treatment interventions are recommended.",Combined effects of hyperphosphatemia and hyperglycemia on the calcification of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651873,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hyperphosphatemia caused by CKD induces the transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into chondrocytes or osteoblast-like cells. Hyperglycemia may also accelerate VC. However, the exact mechanisms of this remain unclear. The effects of simultaneous hyperphosphatemia and hyperglycemia require investigation. CKD rat models are typically used to study VC, which are far removed from the clinical situations of patients with CKD. The present study cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in normal, hyperphosphatemic and/or hyperglycemic conditions for 14 days. Alizarin red staining, calcification content, VSMC differentiation marker gene expression, phenotypic osteoblast gene expression and type III sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter-1 (Pit-1) protein expression was examined. Hyperphosphatemia and hyperglycemia had combined effects in promoting calcification, phenotypic transition and Pit-1 expression in cultured HASMCs. In the present study, the combined effects of hyperphosphatemia and hyperglycemia on the calcification and phenotypic transition of HASMCs were demonstrated. Hyperphosphatemia combined with hyperglycemia medium should be considered an appropriate experimental model to study VC in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Pit-1 should be considered as a promising index of VC.",Long non-coding RNA ZEB1-AS1 indicates poor prognosis and promotes melanoma progression through targeting miR-1224-5p.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651872,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have critical roles in various types of cancer, but their roles in the development of melanoma and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the role of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 antisense RNA 1 (ZEB1-AS1) in melanoma was assessed. The expression levels of ZEB1-AS1 were increased in melanoma cell lines and tumor tissues as indicated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that higher expression of ZEB1-AS1 predicts poor prognosis of melanoma patients. Furthermore, knockdown of ZEB1-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma, suggesting a role of ZEB1-AS1 in the development and progression of melanoma. In addition, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that the expression of miR-1224-5p was directly regulated by ZEB1-AS1. Transfection with miR-1224-5p mimics reduced the levels of ZEB1-AS1 and the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma. In conclusion, ZEB1-AS1 enhances the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma, at least in part by inhibiting the expression of miR-1224-5p, and its overexpression is associated with poor survival of melanoma patients. In addition, the ZEB1-AS1/miR-1224-5p interaction may be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.",Effects of altitude changes on mild-to-moderate closed-head injury in rats following acute high-altitude exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651871,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Mild-to-moderate closed-head injury (mmCHI) is an acute disease induced by high-altitudes. It is general practice to transfer patients to lower altitudes for treatment, but the pathophysiological changes at different altitudes following mmCHI remain unknown. The present study simulated acute high-altitude exposure (6,000 m above sea level) in rats to establish a model of mmCHI and recorded their vital signs. The rats were then randomly assigned into different altitude exposure groups (6,000, 4,500 and 3,000 m) and neurological severity score (NSS), body weight (BW), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain water content (BWC) and the ratio of BW/BWC at 6, 12 and 24 h following mmCHI, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were analysed in all groups. The results revealed that within the first 24 h following acute high-altitude exposure, mmCHI induced dehydration, brain oedema and neuronal damage. Brain injury in rats was significantly reversed following descent to 4,500 m compared with the results from 6,000 or 3,000 m. The results indicated that subjects should be transported as early as possible. Furthermore, avoiding large-span descent altitude was beneficial to reduce neurological impairment. The examination of brain-specific biomarkers and MRI may further be useful in determining the prognosis of high-altitude mmCHI. These results may provide guidance for rescuing high altitude injuries.",ROS induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the TGF-β1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in diabetic nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651870,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Oxidative stress has been reported to serve an important role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells promotes renal fibrosis in DN, while the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated EMT is not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of high glucose-induced ROS on the activation of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in a normal rat kidney tubular epithelial cell line (NRK-52E) and rats with type 1 diabetes. In vitro, high glucose-stimulated ROS production resulted in increased TGF-β1 expression as well as an increase in the Akt and mTOR phosphorylation ratio, resulting in EMT. When cells were pre-treated with ROS inhibitors, changes in TGF-β1, Akt and mTOR were significantly ameliorated. In vivo, diabetic rats experienced a significant decline in renal function and severe renal fibrosis compared with control rats at 8 weeks following streptozocin injection. Levels of malondialdehyde and TGF-β1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation were increased in the renal cortex of rats with diabetes compared with the control rats. Furthermore, renal fibrosis was further aggravated in DN compared with the control rats. The results of the present study suggest that ROS serves an important role in mediating high glucose-induced EMT and inhibits activation of the TGF-β1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. ROS may therefore have potential as a treatment approach to prevent renal fibrosis in DN."

In the present study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction data demonstrated that XIST was significantly upregulated in OS tissues and cell lines (Saos-2, U2OS, HOS and MG63) compared with adjacent non-tumour tissues and normal human osteoblast cell line HFOB1.19. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay data demonstrated that XIST could directly target microRNA (miR)-137 and negatively regulate the expression of miR-137 in Saos-2 and U2OS cells. Furthermore, miR-137 was markedly downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines. An inverse association between XIST and miR-137 expression was observed in OS tissues. Knockdown of XIST caused a significant reduction in cell proliferation and invasion and suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2) and MMP9 protein levels in Saos-2 and U2OS cells. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-137 expression abolished the effects of XIST downregulation on the proliferation and invasion of OS cells. In summary, the present study suggests that XIST promotes OS cell proliferation and invasion by inhibition of miR-137 expression. Thus, XIST may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of OS.",TBX2 overexpression promotes proliferation and invasion through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ERK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651856,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"The present study aimed to clarify the clinical significance and biological effects of T-box (TBX)2 and its potential mechanism in gastric cancer (GC). TBX2 protein expression levels in human GC tissues were investigated using immunohistochemistry, and it was demonstrated that TBX2 was overexpressed in 55.9% (90/161) GC samples. TBX2 overexpression correlated with tumor invasion, advanced tumor node metastasis stage and presence of lymph node metastasis. In addition, TBX2 correlated with poor patient survival. To investigate the effect of TBX2 on biological behaviors, TBX2 plasmid transfection was performed in SGC-7901 cells and TBX2 small interfering RNA knockdown was carried out in BGC-823 cells. MTT and matrigel invasion assays demonstrated that TBX2 overexpression promoted proliferation and invasion, whereas TBX2 depletion inhibited proliferation and invasion. TBX2 overexpression also promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition by downregulating E-cadherin and upregulating N-cadherin. TBX2 overexpression also upregulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, cyclin E and phosphorylated-extracellular signal regulated kinase levels, however downregulated p21. In conclusion, TBX2 may serve as an effective predictor and therapeutic target in human GC.",The effect of aerobic dance intervention on brain spontaneous activity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A resting-state functional MRI study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651855,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a specially designed moderate-intensity aerobic dance (SDMIAD) on brain spontaneous activity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). A total of 38 subjects with MCI were recruited to the current study and were randomized into two groups: Exercise (EG, n=19) and control (CG, n=19). The EG was treated with a SDMIAD and usual care for 3 months. The CG only received usual care. None of the patients were administered medicine that affected cognition during the intervention. The cognitive assessments and RS-fMRI examination were performed on the two groups at recruitment and after 3 months. The cognitive functions were assessed by various neuropsychological tests. The brain spontaneous activity change was assessed using an index, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of fMRI signal. Cognitive assessments demonstrated that EG had significantly improved results in the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory (WMS-R LM) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (all P<0.05), and the difference in changes in WMS-R LM from baseline to 3 months between the EG and the CG was also statistically significant (P<0.05) after 3 months of SDMIAD. The performance of all the cognitive assessments did not demonstrate significant differences in CG. Compared with baseline, EG exhibited significantly increased ALFF in several areas, including the bilateral fronto-temporal, entorhinal, anterior cingulate and parohippocampal cortex after 3 months of SDMIAD (P<0.05); whereas the CG exhibited significantly increased ALFF only in a few areas, including right temporal and posterior cingulate cortex (P<0.05). The SDMIAD may effectively improve the cognitive function in older adults with MCI. RS-fMRI provided a quantitative method for evaluating the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive function.",Expression of microRNA-21 in osteoporotic patients and its involvement in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651854,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Expression of microRNA-21 in bone tissue and serum of patients with osteoporosis (OP) and its involvement in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were investigated. Bone tissue and serum were collected from 48 patients with OP and 48 normal subjects. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of six microRNAs. Among these microRNAs, the expression level of microRNA-21 in bone tissue and serum of OP patients was the lowest. In addition, BMSCs of SD rats were isolated and cultured. Subculture was performed 3 times, transfection of microRNA-21 was performed and osteogenic differentiation was induced. Control group [negative control (NC)] was transfected with microRNA-21 mimics followed by osteogenic induction. Experimental groups were transfected with microRNA-21 analogue (mimics) and microRNA-21 inhibitor (inhibitor) followed by osteogenic induction. Ten days after osteogenic induction, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining were performed to measure the mineralized stained area and the number of mineralized nodules in each treatment group. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of osteogenic genes in each group of cells. RT-qPCR results showed that microRNA-21 expression was lower in bone tissue and serum of patients with OP than that of normal subjects. Moreover, compared with control group, BMSCs showed increased stained mineralized areas, deeper color and increased number of mineralized nodules. In addition, increased mRNA expression of osteogenic genes was evident after microRNA-21 mimics transfection and osteogenic induction (p<0.05). Compared with control group, BMSCs showed decreased stained mineralized areas, lighter color, decreased number of mineralized nodules, and decreased mRNA expression of osteogenic genes after microRNA-21 inhibitor transfection and osteogenic induction (p<0.05). MicroRNA-21 is expressed at low level in bone tissue and serum in patients with OP, and microRNA-21 can promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Our study provided theoretical basis for drug treatment of OP.",Application of different anesthetic methods in coronary artery bypass grafting and the effect on postoperative outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651852,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Application of different anesthetic methods in coronary artery bypass grafting and its effect on postoperative outcome were explored. Ninety-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in Jining No. 1 People's Hospital from March 2017 to February 2018 were randomly divided into the control and observation groups. The control group was anesthetized by fentanyl and propofol. The observation group was anesthetized by sevoflurane combined anesthesia. The mean heart rates (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and cardiac index (CI) in the two groups were compared. The levels of β endorphin (β-EP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in patients were examined. Adverse reactions in the two groups were compared. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the changes of serum inflammatory factors. The prognosis of the two groups was analyzed and compared. MoCA and MMSE scale were used to evaluate postoperative cognitive function in the two groups. The levels of β-EP and MDA in the two groups during operation were higher than those before operation (P<0.05). On the third, fifth and seventh day after operation, the CRP, TNF-α and IL-6 levels of the two groups increased significantly compared to those before operation (P<0.05). The eating time and out of bed time in the observation group were significantly earlier than those in the control group, and the length of stay in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P<0.05). On the first day after operation, the scores of MoCA and MMSE in the observation group were better than those in the control group (P<0.05). The two different anesthetic methods can maintain the perioperative hemodynamic stability of coronary artery bypass patients, but sevoflurane intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia can effectively adjust the β-EP in the body, and reduce the oxidative stress response, which is favorable for postoperative outcome.",Bone marrow adipose amount influences vertebral bone strength.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651851,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Association of bone marrow adipose and microstructure with bone strength in osteoporotic rats using MR Dixon analysis and micro-CT was evaluated. A total of 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats (6-month-old) were divided randomly into sham-operated (SHAM, n=20) group and ovariectomized (OVX, n=20) group. Fat fraction (FF) was measured by two-point Dixon method with MR imaging at the baseline, 4th, 8th and 12th week, respectively. After sacrifice by anesthesia, the fifth lumbar vertebrae bone was sampled for micro-CT scanning. The biomechanical analysis was also performed. FF in osteoporotic rats significantly increases with time, which correlates with bone microstructure parameters. Compared with biomechanical test, FF showed negative correlation with break stress and elastic modulus. It also suggested that loss of bone mass was accompanied with the increase of adipose tissue content in vertebrae bone marrow. The impairment of bone strength leads to the risk of brittle fracture. In conclusion, the bone marrow adipose amount obtained by MR Dixon and microstructure by micro-CT correlates to bone strength in osteoporotic rats.","Stimulation of tolerogenic dendritic cells using dexamethasone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 represses autologous T cell activation and chondrocyte inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651850,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Human osteoarthritis (OA) has been reclassified as a systemic musculoskeletal disorder involving activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines may serve a key function in the development of the disease. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone (vitD3/Dex) may inhibit inflammation by acting on tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) in chronic inflammatory conditions. In the present study, DCs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with OA. DCs expressing high levels of co-stimulatory molecules maintain a tolerogenic phenotype under stimulation with LPS, which promotes DC maturation to generate tolDCs. When vitD3/Dex were added in the current study, the tolDCs produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including low levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10, and high levels of transforming growth factor-β. However, when vitD3/Dex were added to DCs without LPS stimulation, the levels of IL-10 were high. DCs with LPS stimulation increased the percentage of T-cells that produced IFN-γ and IL-17 and DCs with vitD3/Dex treatment alone increased the percentage of T-cells that produced IL-10 and FoxP3. However, those cytokines decrease in DCs co-processed with LPS and vitD3/Dex. The IL-10 release by the stimulated T cells was indicated to repress autologous T cell proliferation via soluble IL-10 and cell-cell contact. Furthermore, tolDCs and regulatory T cells suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-13 secretion by chondrocytes. Additionally, Akt and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling were demonstrated to be involved in the regulatory effects of Dec and vitD3 in DCs. The present findings suggest a novel mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of tolDCs, particularly in association with the pathogenesis of OA.",Hydroxytyrosol protects against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651849,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a phenolic compound extracted from olive oil, is reported to protect against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI), but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The mitochondria permeability transition pore (MPTP) is an important therapeutic target for MIRI. The present study aimed to investigate the role of MPTP in the cardioprotection of HT. Isolated rat hearts were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus and subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion to mimic a MIRI model. Isolated hearts were pretreated with different doses of HT (10, 100 and 1,000 µM) for 10 min prior to ischemia. Myocardial infarct size was detected using TTC staining. Changes in myocardial cell structure were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. MPTP opening was detected spectrophotometrically. Myocardial cell apoptosis was observed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays. The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was measured by western blot analysis. The data revealed that HT (100 and 1,000 µM) treatment significantly alleviated pathological damage in ischemic myocardium and reduced myocardial infarct size compared with the untreated control. However, no significant difference was observed in the 10 µM HT treatment group compared with the untreated control. It was further revealed that HT decreased the B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-like protein 4 (Bax)/Bcl-2 ratio, suppressed MPTP opening and subsequently decreased the expression of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-9 and -3, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Additionally, the beneficial effects of HT on MIRI were reversed by atractyloside, which induces MPTP opening. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that HT inhibited MPTP opening, partially via modulation of Bax and Bcl-2, thereby protecting against MIRI and thereby providing a pharmacological basis for future research and treatment of MIRI.",Nischarin attenuates apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in PC12 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651848,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"Nischarin (NISCH) is a cytoplasmic protein known to serve an inhibitory role in breast cancer cell apoptosis, migration and invasion. Recently, NISCH has been reported to be involved in the regulation of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Oxidative stress contributes to tissue injury and cell apoptosis during the development of various diseases, including SCI. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NISCH in the regulation of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in PC12 cells. H2O2 was used to establish an oxidative stress model in PC12 cells. Apoptosis levels were examined using flow cytometry analysis, and the expression of NISCH, Bcl-2, Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3 were examined using western blot and immunofluorescence staining analyses. The results demonstrated that treatment with 100 µM H2O2 significantly increased the apoptotic rate and expression of NISCH in PC12 cells. At 48 h following incubation with 100 µM H2O2, NISCH downregulation partially inhibited apoptosis of PC12 cells. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly reduced and the expression of Bax and caspase-3 were significantly increased by H2O2 treatment. These effects were also partially inhibited by the downregulation of NISCH. The authors of the present study therefore hypothesize that NISCH may function as a pro-apoptotic protein that participates in the regulation of oxidative stress, and NISCH downregulation may protect cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.",Differential expression of serum proteins in multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651846,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 01 20,"The exact cause instigating multiple myeloma (MM) has not been fully elucidated, and the disease has a median survival of 6 months without any treatment. To identify potential biomarkers of MM, serum proteins reflecting alteration in their proteomes were analyzed in 6 patients with MM compared with 6 healthy controls using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry. The most notable differentially expressed proteins were validated by immunoblotting and changes in mRNA expression were evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A total of 11 differentially expressed protein spots were found. The expression levels of 7 proteins [Immunoglobulin heavy constant µ; proto-oncogene diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DBL2); 26S protease regulatory subunit 4 (P26s4); serum albumin; haptoglobin; and two unknown proteins with isoelectronic point (pI) of 6.41 and molecular weight of 35.4 kDa, and pI of 8.05 and molecular weight of 27.4 kDa, respectively] were downregulated in MM compared with healthy controls. Expression of gel actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1A (ARPC1A); immunoglobulin heavy constant γ 1; fibrinogen α chain (FGA) fragment D; and zinc finger protein 70 were increased in serum of MM patients. Protein expressions of ARPC1A, FGA, P26s4 and DBL2 were measured by immunoblotting in an independent cohort of 12 MM patients and 10 healthy controls. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that ARPC1A expression only mimicked protein expression, whereas FGA, PSMC1 (encoding P26s4) and MCF2 (encoding DBL2) did not exhibit significant changes in mRNA expression between control and MM samples. These proteins represent putative serological biomarkers for patients with MM."
