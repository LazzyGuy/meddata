Among them, the isocyanide-based Ugi-Joulliè reaction is particularly suited for the rapid synthesis of peptidomimetics and nitrogen-containing compounds. Areas covered: The latest achievements in drug discovery and synthetic chemistry regarding the application of the Ugi-Joulliè reaction in the field of natural compounds, peptidomimetics and small molecules, are reported in this article. All relevant literature was disclosed applying most common web-based literature searching tools, namely Web of Science, PubMed, SciFinder and Google Scholar. Expert opinion: The Ugi-Joulliè reaction represents an extremely versatile and simple synthetic methodology, useful for designing efficiently new molecular frameworks. Particularly relevant to drug discovery is the Ugi-Joulliè-based synthesis of conformationally constrained peptidomimetics and antibacterial depsipeptides. On the other hand, the many syntheses of new, nitrogen-containing heterocycles are not always followed by biological evaluation, losing opportunities for the disclosure of unprecedented lead compounds.",Myonectin deletion promotes adipose fat storage and reduces liver steatosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002535,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2019 04 24,"We recently described myonectin (also known as erythroferrone) as a novel skeletal muscle-derived myokine with metabolic functions. Here, we use a genetic mouse model to determine myonectin's requirement for metabolic homeostasis. Female myonectin-deficient mice had larger gonadal fat pads and developed mild insulin resistance when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and had reduced food intake during refeeding after an unfed period but were otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Male mice lacking myonectin, however, had reduced physical activity when fed ad libitum and in the postprandial state but not during the unfed period. When stressed with an HFD, myonectin-knockout male mice had significantly elevated VLDL-triglyceride (TG) and strikingly impaired lipid clearance from circulation following an oral lipid load. Fat distribution between adipose and liver was also altered in myonectin-deficient male mice fed an HFD. Greater fat storage resulted in significantly enlarged adipocytes and was associated with increased postprandial lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue. Parallel to this was a striking reduction in liver steatosis due to significantly reduced TG accumulation. Liver metabolite profiling revealed additional significant changes in bile acids and 1-carbon metabolism pathways. Combined, our data affirm the physiologic importance of myonectin in regulating local and systemic lipid metabolism.-Little, H. C., Rodriguez, S., Lei, X., Tan, S. Y., Stewart, A.

However, the poor developmental potential of germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes is still suboptimal. This study's objective was to evaluate the effect of a microvibration culture system (MVC) during IVM and/or in vitro culture (IVC) on the clinical outcomes and the embryonic development potential of human GV-stage oocytes collected from human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)-primed IVM and fertilization-embryo transfer (IVM/F-ET) cycles of patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO). A total of 206 HCG-primed IVM/F-ET cycles were divided into four groups according to the microvibration and static culture system applied during IVM and/or IVC: Group SS (static system during both IVM and IVC); Group SV (static system during IVM alternated with microvibration system during IVC); Group VS (microvibration system during IVM alternated with static system during IVC), and Group VV (microvibration system during both IVM and IVC). The results indicate that the rates of in vitro MII oocytes per cycle, fertilization, and cleavage were not significantly different between the groups. The rate of good-quality embryos in Group SV tended to be higher than the rate in Groups SS and VS, but there was no significant difference between Group SS and Group SV. Clinical pregnancy, implantation, and live birth rates of Groups SV and VS were slightly higher than those of Group SS. However, the rate of good-quality embryos with at least six cells on day 4, the clinical pregnancy, implantation, and live births in Group VV were significantly higher than those in Group SS. These results indicate that, compared with the static culture system, the MVC system applied for both IVM and IVC seems to improve the clinical outcomes and the quality of embryos of GV oocytes derived from HCG-primed IVM/F-ET cycles in PCO patients.

Androgen deprivation therapy has been widely used to inhibit PCa growth but eventually fails in many patients. Androgen receptor and its downstream molecules like microRNAs could be promising therapeutic targets. We aimed to investigate the involvement of miR-21 in PCa tumorigenesis. We found that miR-21 was an unfavorable factor and correlated positively with tumor grade in PCa patients from TCGA database. MiR-21 was more highly expressed in androgen-independent PCa cells than in androgen-dependent PCa cells. Overexpression of miR-21 promoted androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, increased miR-21 expression promoted mouse xenograft growth. We identified nine genes differentially expressed in PCa tumors and normal tissue which could be potential targets of miR-21 by bioinformatic analyses. We demonstrate that miR-21 directly targeted KLF5 and inhibited KLF5 mRNA and protein levels in PCa. STRING and functional enrichment analysis results suggest that GSK3B might be regulated by KLF5. Our findings demonstrate that miR-21 promotes the tumorigenesis of PCa cells by directly targeting KLF5. These biological effects are mediated through upregulation of GSK3B and activation of the AKT signaling pathway.",Pediatric drug safety signal detection of non-chemotherapy drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis using electronic healthcare records.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002530,Expert opinion on drug safety,2019 05 28,"Objectives: This study aimed to develop a procedure to explore the adverse drug reaction signals of drug-induced neutropenia (DIN) or drug-induced agranulocytosis (DIA) in children using an electronic health records (EHRs) database. Methods: A two-stage design was presented. First, the suspected drugs to induce DIN or DIA were selected. Second, the associations were evaluated by a retrospective cohort study. Results: Ten and five drugs were potentially identified to be associated with DIN and DIA, respectively. Finally, five (oseltamivir, chlorpheniramine, vancomycin, meropenem, and ganciclovir) and two (chlorpheniramine, and vancomycin) drugs were found to be associated with DIN and DIA, respectively. Of these, the association between oseltamivir and neutropenia (P = 9.83 × 10-9; OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.62-2.69) was considered as a new signal for both adults and children.

To compare how stromal cells derived from women who are lean or obese influence response to the aromatase inhibitor (anastrazole), we incorporated patient-derived stroma in a previously characterized MCF7-derived in vitro duct model. Coculture with adipose stromal cells enabled the metabolism of testosterone (T) to E2, which induced estrogen response element activity, epithelial proliferation, and hyperplasia in MCF7 cells. The effects of T were inhibited by the ER antagonist tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor anastrazole and were increased by the aromatase inducer dexamethasone. Primary mammary adipose stromal cells derived from women with obesity displayed increased aromatase mRNA compared with lean controls. MCF7-derived ducts cocultured with obese stromal cells exhibited higher maximal aromatization-induced ER transactivation and reduced anastrazole sensitivity, a difference not seen in 2-dimensional coculture. Finally, tamoxifen was more effective than anastrazole at reducing aromatization-induced ER transactivation and proliferation. These findings suggest that patient-specific responses to hormone therapies can be modeled and studied organotypically in vitro and add to evidence advocating obesity as a parameter to consider when identifying treatments for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.-Morgan, M.

T cells, notably T helper (Th)-1 and Th17 cells, play a critical role in the pathologic process of RA. However, it remains unclear how Th1 and Th17 cells are regulated during RA. In this study, we report that the small ubiquitin-like protein X-linked gene in the G6PD cluster at Xq28 (GdX) regulates the balance of Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells during collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We discovered that the splenocytes of GdX-knockout (KO) mice were insensitive to T-cell stimulants. Correspondingly, GdX-KO mice showed alleviative Th1-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity and were resistant to CIA compared with wild-type mice. GdX-KO mice showed fewer swollen paws, lower serum proinflammatory cytokine and anti-collagen IgG levels, and decreased synovial hyperplasia. Mechanistically, we observed that deletion of GdX decreased the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and impaired the Th1 and Th17 differentiation but increased the Treg cell proliferation. Consistently, deletion of GdX decreased the transcription level of T-cell-specific T-box transcription factor and RAR-related orphan receptor-γ transcription factor but increased that of forkhead box P3 after being challenged with type-II collagen. These findings suggested that GdX functions as an important regulator of Th1 or Th17 and Treg cell balance during the inflammatory responses. Therefore, GdX may be a potential target for the therapy of RA.-Fu, Y., Liu, S., Wang, Y., Ren, F., Fan, X., Liang, J., Liu, C., Li, J., Ju, Y., Chang, Z.

We present a facile synthetic method for hybrid composites of perovskites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). A simple two-step solution-based method without organic surfactants was employed to make all-inorganic lead-halide perovskites (CsPbX3; X = Cl, Br, I, or mixed halide compositions) form directly in the pores of MIL-101 MOF. That is, a polar organic solution of lead halide (PbX2) was impregnated into the MOF pores to give PbX2@MIL-101, which was then subjected to a perovskite-formation reaction with cesium halide (CsX) dissolved in methanol. The compositions of the halogen anions in the perovskites can be modulated with various halide precursors, leading to CsPbX3@MIL-101 composites with X3 = Cl3, Cl2Br, Br2Cl, Br3, Br2I, I2Br, and I3 that exhibit gradual variation of band gap energies and tuned emission wavelengths from 417 to 698 nm."

A,2019 04 30,"In Zeeman deceleration, only a small subset of low-field-seeking particles in the incoming beam possess initial velocities and positions that place them within the phase-space acceptance of the device. In order to maximize the number of particles that are successfully decelerated to a selected final velocity, we seek to optimize the phase-space acceptance of the decelerator. Three-dimensional particle trajectory simulations are employed to investigate the potential benefits of using a covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) optimization method for decelerators longer than 12 stages and for decelerating species other than H atoms. In all scenarios considered, the evolutionary algorithm-optimized sequences yield vastly more particles within the target velocity range. This is particularly evident in scenarios where standard sequences are known to perform poorly; simulations show that CMA-ES optimization of a standard sequence decelerating H atoms from an initial velocity of 500 ms-1 down to a final velocity of 200 ms-1 in a 24-stage decelerator produces a considerable 5921% (or 60-fold) increase in the number of successfully decelerated particles. Particle losses that occur with standard pulse sequences-for example, arising from the coupling of longitudinal and transverse motion-are overcome in the CMA-ES optimization process as the passage of all particles through the decelerator is explicitly considered and focusing effects are accounted for in the optimization process.",Metabolomics-Based Approach for the Discrimination of Potato Varieties ( Solanum tuberosum) using UPLC-IMS-QToF.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002513,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 15,"One hundred eighty-two authentic potato samples ( Solanum tuberosum) of known variety were collected from various German regions in 2016 and 2017. Samples were extracted with a liquid-liquid-extraction protocol that included isopropanol, methanol, and water in order to focus on lipophilic metabolites. The analysis of nonpolar extracts was performed using an UPLC-IMS-QToF-MS system; data sets obtained were evaluated via multivariate data analysis. A selection of 14 key metabolites with a significant difference in their abundance profiles was identified. This set of markers contained four hydroxylated glucocerebrosides, two phosphoinositols, one phosphocholine, and seven acylated sterol glucosides based on stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, which primarily enable the varietal discrimination. Fragments and neutral losses commonly appearing within one class or subclass of lipids were summarized within a new database that included ion mobility data. The performance of the approach was verified with twenty-nine commercial potato samples.",Experimental Approach to the Study of Anharmonicity in the Infrared Spectrum of Pyrene from 14 to 723 K.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002512,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 06 11,"Quantifying the effect of anharmonicity on the infrared spectrum of large molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at high temperatures is the focus of a number of theoretical and experimental studies, many of them motivated by astrophysical applications. We recorded the IR spectrum of pyrene C16H10 microcrystals embedded in KBr pellets over a wide range of temperatures (14-723 K) and studied the evolution of band positions, widths, and integrated intensities with temperature. We identified jumps for some of the spectral characteristics of some bands in the 423-473 K range. These were attributed to a change of phase from crystal to molten in condensed pyrene, which appears to affect more strongly bands involving large CH motions. Empirical anharmonicity factors that quantify the linear evolution of band positions and widths with temperature for values larger than ∼150-250 K, depending on the band, were retrieved from both phases and averaged to provide recommended values for these anharmonicity factors. The derived values were found to be consistent with available gas phase data. We conclude about the relevance of the methodology to produce data that can be compared with calculated anharmonic IR spectra and provide input for models that simulate the IR emission of astro-PAHs.",Framework for Conducting and Analyzing Crystal Simulations of Nucleic Acids to Aid in Modern Force Field Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002511,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 06 13,"Crystal simulations provide useful tools, along with solution simulations, to test nucleic acid force fields, but should be interpreted with care owing to the difficulty of establishing the environmental conditions needed to reproduce experimental crystal packing. These challenges underscore the need to construct proper protocols for carrying out crystal simulations and analyzing results to identify the origin of deviations from crystallographic data. Toward this end, we introduce a novel framework for B-factor decomposition into additive intramolecular, rotational, and translational atomic fluctuation components and partitioning of each of these components into individual asymmetric unit and lattice contributions. We apply the framework to a benchmark set of A-DNA, Z-DNA, and B-DNA double helix systems of various chain lengths. Overall, the intramolecular deviations from the crystal were quite small (≤1.0 Å), suggesting high accuracy of the force field, whereas crystal packing was not well reproduced. The present work establishes a framework to conduct and analyze crystal simulations that ultimately take on issues of crystal packing and can provide insight into nucleic acid force fields.",Fuplatin: An Efficient and Low-Toxic Dual-Prodrug.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002510,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 09,"As FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil are widely used in clinic but limited by severe side-effects.

B,2019 05 09,"The structural and dynamic properties of imidazole in aqueous solution have been studied by means of classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We developed a new force field for the imidazole molecule with improved modeling of the electrostatic interactions, specifically tailored to address the well-known drawbacks of existing force fields based on the atomic fractional charge approach. To this end, we reparametrized the charge distribution on the heterocyclic ring, introducing an extra site accounting for the lone pair on the deprotonated nitrogen. The accuracy of the model in describing the hydrogen bond pattern in the aqueous solvent has been confirmed by comparing the classical results on imidazole-water interactions to accurate Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. It reproduces satisfactorily the experimental water/octanol partition coefficient of imidazole, as well as the structure of the imidazole molecular crystal.

Two of these compounds exhibited low micromolar activity against Mtb with half maximal effective inhibitory concentrations of 1.7 and 4.0 μM. Our selectivity and preliminary pharmacokinetic studies showed that the compounds possess a higher degree of specificity against MtbAdoK when compared with the human counterpart and are well tolerated in rodents, respectively. Finally, crystallographic studies showed the molecular basis of inhibition, potency, and selectivity and revealed the presence of a potentially therapeutically relevant cavity unique to the MtbAdoK homodimer.",Nickel-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling of Umpolung Carbonyls and Alkyl Halides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002507,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 05 17,"An effective nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of Umpolung carbonyls and alkyl halides was developed.

Unfortunately, some combinations of bond and dihedral angles can reach cliffs on the energy landscape which lead to numerical disasters. We describe changes to the formulation (NAST improved, NASTI) which smooth the dihedral energy term when neighboring angles become flat. We also improved the fit to experimental structures by replacing the harmonic term for the backbone angles with spline functions and using a more sophisticated approach to calculate energies for fragments that span both helix and loop regions. A newer, larger set of structures was used for the parametrization. The new formulation can be run for millions of steps without a thermostat, whereas NAST routinely suffers numerical catastrophes. Simulations with NASTI showed no decrease in the quality of the structures as reflected by slightly better GDT-TS scores and, in three of the five cases, marginally better RMSD values when compared to the crystal structures.",Interactions of Water and Alkanes: Modifying Additive Force Fields to Account for Polarization Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002505,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 13,"Atomistic biomolecular simulations predominantly utilize additive force fields (FF), where the electrostatic potential is modeled by fixed point charges. Among other consequences, the lack of polarizability in these models undermines the balance of hydrophilic/hydrophobic nonbonded interactions. Simulations of water/alkane systems using the TIP3P water model and CHARMM36 parameters reveal a 1 kcal/mol overestimate of the experimental transfer free energy of water to hexadecane; more recent optimized water models (SPC/E, TIP4P/2005, TIP4P-Ew, TIP3P-FB, TIP4P-FB, OPC, TIP4P-D) overestimate this transfer free energy by approximately 2 kcal/mol. In contrast, the polarizable SWM4-NDP and SWM6 water models reproduce experimental values to within statistical error. As an alternative to explicitly modeling polarizability, this paper develops an efficient automated workflow to optimize pair-specific Lennard-Jones parameters within an additive FF. Water/hexadecane is used as a prototype and the free energy of water transfer to hexadecane as a target. The optimized model yields quantitative agreement with the experimental transfer free energy and improves the water/hexadecane interfacial tension by 6%. Simulations of five different lipid bilayers show a strong increase of water permeabilities compared to the unmodified CHARMM36 lipid FF which consistently improves match with experiment: the order-of-magnitude underestimate for monounsaturated bilayers is rectified and the factor of 2.8-4 underestimate for saturated bilayers is turned into a factor of 1.5-3 overestimate. While agreement with experiment is decreased for the diffusion constant of water in hexadecane, alkane transfer free energies, and the bilayers' area per lipid, the method provides a permeant-specific route to achieve a wide range of heterogeneous observables via rapidly optimized pairwise parameters."

Therefore, it is of great interest to find new materials for SO2 sorption to improve classic flue gas desulfurization. In this work, we present SO2 sorption studies for the three different metal-organic frameworks MOF-177, NH2-MIL-125(Ti), and MIL-160. MOF-177 revealed a new record high SO2 uptake (25.7 mmol·g-1 at 293 K and 1 bar). Both NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and MIL-160 show particular high SO2 uptakes at low pressures ( p < 0.01 bar) and thus are interesting candidates for the removal of remaining SO2 traces below 500 ppm from flue gas mixtures. The aluminum furandicarboxylate MOF MIL-160 is the most promising material, especially under application-orientated conditions, and features excellent ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivities (124-128 at 293 K, 1 bar; 79-95 at 353 K, 1 bar) and breakthrough performance with high onset time, combined with high stability under both humid and dry SO2 exposure. The outstanding sorption capability of MIL-160 could be explained by DFT simulation calculations and matching heat of adsorption for the binding sites Ofuran···SSO2 and OHAl-chain···OSO2 (both ∼40 kJ·mol-1) and Ofuran/carboxylate···SSO2 (∼55-60 kJ·mol-1).",Self-Assembled Oxaliplatin(IV) Prodrug-Porphyrin Conjugate for Combinational Photodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002492,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 08,"Nanomedicine has emerged as a promising strategy for effective cancer treatment. A useful approach is to develop carrier-free nanodrugs via a facile supramolecular self-assembly process. To achieve high therapeutic effect, integrating photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy has been sought after. In this work, we designed a nanocarrier (PEG-Por-CD: oxliPt(IV)-ada) assembled with oxaliplatin prodrug (oxliPt(IV)-ada) and porphyrin photosensitizer (PEG-Por-CD) through host-guest interaction to achieve stimulus-responsive combination therapy. Contributed by excellent spatial control of the binding ratio between host and guest molecules, porphyrin and oxaliplatin were separately modified with β-cyclodextrin and adamantane to prepare the amphiphilic host-guest complex for subsequent self-assembly into therapeutic nanoparticles. The obtained PEG-Por-CD: oxliPt(IV)-ada nanoparticles exhibited good colloidal stability with an average hydrodynamic size of 164 nm while undergoing the disassembly under reductive environment to release active therapeutic species. Confocal imaging demonstrated the ability of PEG-Por-CD: oxliPt(IV)-ada to effectively accumulate in the cells and produce reactive oxygen species in vitro upon 630 nm light irradiation. As compared with the monotherapy, the PEG-Por-CD: oxliPt(IV)-ada nanoparticles exhibited 3-fold enhanced cytotoxicity and 2-fold increase in the apoptosis. In vivo experiments using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice confirmed that the nanoparticles were efficient in suppressing the tumor growth without eliciting systemic toxicity. The present self-delivery nanosystem constructed from the self-assembly approach not only allows precise control over the drug and photosensitizer loading ratio but also eliminates systemic toxicity concern of the drug carriers, providing a solution for further development of combinational cancer treatment.",Small Molecule Potentiation of Gram-Positive Selective Antibiotics against Acinetobacter baumannii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002491,ACS infectious diseases,2019 06 10,"In 2016, the World Health Organization deemed antibiotic resistance one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development. The need for new methods to combat infections caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens will require a variety of approaches to identifying effective new therapeutic strategies. One approach is the identification of small molecule adjuvants that potentiate the activity of antibiotics of demonstrated utility, whose efficacy is abated by resistance, both acquired and intrinsic. To this end, we have identified compounds that enhance the efficacy of antibiotics normally ineffective against Gram-negative pathogens because of the outer membrane permeability barrier. We identified two adjuvant compounds that dramatically enhance sensitivity of Acinetobacter baumannii to macrolide and glycopeptide antibiotics, with reductions in minimum inhibitory concentrations as high as 256-fold, and we observed activity across a variety of clinical isolates. Mode of action studies indicate that these adjuvants likely work by modulating lipopolysaccharide synthesis or assembly. The adjuvants were active in vivo in a Galleria mellonella infection model, indicating potential for use in mammalian infections.",Managing costs and care for chronic idiopathic constipation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002490,The American journal of managed care,2019 04 19,"For decades, chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) has been one of the most common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorders encountered by clinicians. Common comorbidities include depression, diabetes, functional dyspepsia, hypothyroidism, overweight, obesity, and neurological disorders. CIC imposes a large economic burden on the American healthcare system with estimated costs of $1912 to $7522 in 2007 US dollars per patient per year. Individuals affected by CIC indicate significant rates of absenteeism and presenteeism at work. Those with constipation have poorer general health, mental health, and social functioning compared with healthy controls. The average patient with CIC tries approximately 4 over-the-counter (OTC) and 2 prescription medications before finding an effective treatment. Guideline-directed treatment generally recommends moving from lifestyle modifications to OTC products and prescription laxatives. Most patients report that the relief they receive is unacceptable. Reliable evidence indicates that newer prescription drugs offer greater relief of symptoms than those of traditional approaches. Appropriate formulary management of CIC offers opportunities to impact patient care in 3 major areas: clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes. Plans will need to be flexible, especially because patient dissatisfaction with treatment is prevalent in CIC.",Update on the management of chronic idiopathic constipation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002489,The American journal of managed care,2019 04 19,"Chronic idiopathic constipation is a functional bowel disorder characterized by difficult, infrequent, and/or incomplete defecation, affecting 35 million adult Americans, resulting in more than millions of physician visits annually.

The current Canadian Guideline for diagnosis of FASD outlines a list of test measures for assessment; however, very little research exists to explore which specific tools are being used in clinical practice. Objectives The purpose of the current study was to gain a better understanding of the testing measures used by FASD clinicians in Alberta, Canada.   Methods A survey was sent to coordinators of 23 Alberta FASD clinics requesting them to distribute the survey to their diagnostic team members, including physicians, psychologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and occupational therapists (OTs).   Results A wide range of measures (both direct and indirect; n = 173) to assess brain domains were reported by clinics. Many tests were used to assess function across multiple brain domains. Most of the commonly used tests aligned with those suggested in the Canadian Guideline; however, there were many additional measures being used that were that were not listed in the Guideline.   Conclusions This study revealed important information about the use of testing measures in FASD assessment and sheds light on the commonalities in practice across clinics in Alberta. Results demonstrate strong convergence of direct and indirect measures to assess brain function. Ultimately, identifying a comprehensive, reliable, and usable testing battery of measures for FASD assessment will improve the clarity and accuracy of the diagnostic process and facilitate advancements in the field, as well as enable comparisons across clinics.",Novel Measures of Benzodiazepine and Z-Drug Utilisation Trends in a Canadian Provincial Adult Population (2001-2016).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002486,Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharamcologie clinique,2019 04 19, 1) To evaluate trends for benzodiazepines (BZD) and Z-Drugs over 15-years in a general Canadian adult population measured by: a) consumption b) pharmacologic exposure c) dose intensity and d) prevalence of use. 2) To demonstrate the utility of Diazepam Milligram Equivalence (DME) based measurements when used in conjunction with traditional standard measurements of drug utilization such as the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) system.,Response to Letter to the Editor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002485,Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharamcologie clinique,2019 04 19,Author's response to comments from Dr Lexchin's Letter to the Editor regarding our article.,"Clinically Significant Drug-Drug Interaction in a Large Antiretroviral Treatment Centre in Lagos, Nigeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002484,Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharamcologie clinique,2019 04 19,"   Background: An important cause of treatment failure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the potential interaction between the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and co-prescribed drugs used concomitantly for the treatment of opportunistic infections and co-morbid ailments in HIV-infected patients.

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of 500 patients  who received treatment between 2005 and 2015, were selected using systematic random sampling, reviewed retrospectively, and evaluated for potential CSDIs using Liverpool HIV Pharmacology Database and other similar databases.                                                                                                                                          Results:  Majority of patients, 421 (84%) were at risk of CSDIs, of  which  410, (82%) were moderate and frequently involved co-trimoxazole + zidovudine (or stavudine) /lamivudine (386, 77.2%) and NNRTIs or PIs + artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) [296, 59.2%]. Age (p=0.131), sex (p=0.316) and baseline CD4+ cell counts (p>0.05) were not significantly associated with CSDIs. The interactions, however, were significantly associated with the development of antiretroviral treatment failure (p <0.001) which occurred in nearly a third (139; 27.8%) of the patients. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of CSDIs between ART and CPDs most of which were categorized as moderate.  Further studies are required to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and clinical relevance of these interactions."

Angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGFs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are vital factors in the formation of CNV. Especially VEGFs are convinced to be the core angiogenic factors in CNV, and MMPs are proved to exert dual effects on the process. Strikingly, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are determined to play key roles in the formation of CNV, while the mechanism is still vague. In this review, the latest researches are reviewed to discuss the role of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CNV respectively and some inhibitors of them are presented.

FUG1, a chloroplast translation initiation factor, and GUN1 are co-expressed at the transcriptional level, and FUG1 co-immunoprecipitates with GUN1. We used mutants of GUN1 (gun1-103) and FUG1 (fug1-3) to analyse their functional relationship at the physiological and system-wide level, the latter including transcriptome and proteome analyses. Absence of GUN1 aggravates the effects of decreased FUG1 levels on chloroplast protein translation, resulting in transiently more pronounced phenotypes regarding photosynthesis, leaf colouration, growth and cold acclimation. The gun1-103 mutation also enhances variegation in the var2 mutant, increasing the fraction of white sectors, while fug1-3 suppresses the var2 phenotype. The transcriptomes of fug1-3 and gun1-103 plants are very similar, but absence of GUN1 alone has almost no effect on protein levels, whereas steady-state levels of chloroplast proteins are markedly decreased in fug1-3. In fug1 gun1 double mutants, effects on transcriptomes and particularly on proteomes are enhanced. Our results show that GUN1 function becomes critical when chloroplast proteostasis is perturbed by decreased rates of synthesis (fug1) or degradation (var2) of chloroplast proteins, or by low temperatures. The functions of FUG1 and GUN1 appear to be related, corroborating the view that GUN1 helps to maintain chloroplast protein homeostasis (proteostasis).",Exploring Australian residents cycling engagement - Differences in self-reported cycling behaviour between urban and rural dwelling Queenslanders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002469,Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 05 09,Cycling participation rates in Australia and Queensland remain low.

Such an introduction could cause significant losses to the livestock industry, in addition to substantial human morbidity and mortality. Because of the opportunistic blood host selection of Culex tarsalis mosquitoes, we hypothesized that this species could be an important bridge vector of RVFV near feedlots in the event of an introduction. We investigated the mosquito community composition at livestock feedlots and surrounding natural and residential areas to determine differences in mosquito relative abundance and blood feeding patterns attributed to cattle feeding operations. DNA extracted from abdomens of blood-fed mosquitoes were sequenced to determine host identity. Multivariate regression analyses revealed differences between mosquito community assemblages at feedlots and non-feedlot sites (p < 0.05), with this effect driven largely by differential abundances of Aedes vexans (padj  < 0.05). Mosquito diversity was lower on feedlots than surrounding areas for three out of four feedlots. Culex tarsalis was abundant at both feedlots and nearby sites. Diverse vertebrate blood meals were detected in Cx. tarsalis at non-feedlot sites, with a shift towards feeding on cattle at feedlots. These data support a potential for Cx. tarsalis to serve as a bridge vector of RVFV between livestock and humans in Colorado.",A protease-responsive fluorescent probe for sensitive imaging of legumain activity in living tumor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002467,Chemical biology & drug design,2019 05 16,"Legumain, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is critical for pathological progression and has been found to play an important role in the occurrence and development of several cancers.

To further understand the role of legumain activity in tumor progression, a legumain protease-responsive fluorescent probe was developed in the present study. The probe 1 was synthesized by conjugating an aminoluciferin fluorophore with an alanine-alanine-asparagine (AAN) peptide sequence. The successful synthesis of probe 1 was validated by NMR and MS spectra as well as HPLC analysis. The probe 1 was non-toxic and exhibited great stability in the physiological solutions. More importantly, compared with the aminoluciferin fluorophore, the peptide conjugation may dramatically increase the targeting specificity. Probe 1 was able to effectively detect the legumain activity in living HCT116 cells through fluorescence imaging.

However, current measurements regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink. We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g., climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices) in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity.","Free fatty acid receptors, G protein-coupled receptor 120 and G protein-coupled receptor 40, are essential for oil-induced gastric inhibitory polypeptide secretion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002464,Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 05 07,"Incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) plays a key role in high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.

THP-1 cells are a commercially available, spontaneously immortalized monocyte-like cell line derived from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia. These cells are an excellent model for suspension cell culture and studies of the immune system. Researchers have used THP-1 cells to study the host response to implantable devices and biomaterials in vitro. Tissue contacting surfaces of implantable materials initiate a host inflammatory response characterized by many events, one of which includes macrophage attachment to the surface, which ultimately leads to degradation and failure of the material.

The observed excellent SHG and phase-matching properties are consistent with our diffraction experiments and can be well explained by using the orthorhombic models obtained through our high throughput simulations.",Association between excessive supraventricular ectopy and subclinical cerebrovascular disease: a population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002446,European journal of neurology,2019 05 09,"The association between an increased supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) and subclinical cerebrovascular disease remains unclear.

The red coloration of rice grains is controlled by two complementary genes, Rc and Rd. The RcRd genotype produces red pericarp in wild species Oryza rufipogon, whereas most cultivated rice varieties produce white grains resulted from a 14-bp frame-shift deletion in the seventh exon of the Rc gene. In the present study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method to functionally restore the recessive rc allele through reverting the 14-bp frame-shift deletion to in-frame mutations in which the deletions were in multiples of three bases, and successfully converted three elite white pericarp rice varieties into red ones. Rice seeds from T1 in-frame Rc lines were measured for proanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins, and high accumulation levels of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins were observed in red grains from the mutants. Moreover, there was no significant difference between wild-type and in-frame Rc mutants in major agronomic traits, indicating that restoration of Rc function had no negative effect on important agronomic traits in rice. Given that most white pericarp rice varieties are resulted from the 14-bp deletion in Rc, it is conceivable that our method could be applied to most white pericarp rice varieties and would greatly accelerate the breeding of new red rice varieties with elite agronomic traits. In addition, our study demonstrates an effective approach to restore recessive frame-shift alleles for crop improvement.",An internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy pain management programme for spinal cord injury pain: A randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002442,"European journal of pain (London, England)",2019 06 13,"Chronic pain is common after spinal cord injury (SCI) and dedicated SCI cognitive behavioural therapy pain management programmes (CBT-PMPs) have a growing evidence base to support their uptake clinically.

HNE is also involved in a variety of pathologies affecting the respiratory system. Thus, compounds able to inhibit HNE proteolytic activity could represent effective therapeutics. We present here a new series of pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives of our previously reported potent HNE inhibitors. Our results show that position 2 of the pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine scaffold must be unsubstituted, and modifications of this position resulted in loss of HNE inhibitory activity. Conversely, the introduction of certain substituents at position 5 was tolerated, with retention of HNE inhibitory activity (IC50  = 15-51 nM) after most substitutions, indicating that bulky and/or lipophilic substituents at position 5 probably interact with the large pocket of the enzyme site and allow Michaelis complex formation. The possibility of Michaelis complex formation between Ser195 and the ligand carbonyl group was assessed by molecular docking, and it was found that highly active HNE inhibitors are characterized by geometries favorable for Michaelis complex formation and by relatively short lengths of the proton transfer channel via the catalytic triad.",Sorafenib Induces Pyroptosis in Macrophages and Triggers Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity Against Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002440,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 05 21,"Antiangiogenic and cytotoxic effects are considered the principal mechanisms of action of sorafenib, a multitarget kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report that sorafenib also acts through direct immune modulation, indispensable for its antitumor activity. In vivo cell depletion experiments in two orthotopic HCC mouse models as well as in vitro analysis identified macrophages (MΦ) as the key mediators of the antitumoral effect and demonstrate a strong interdependency of MΦ and natural killer (NK) cells for efficient tumor cell killing. Caspase 1 analysis in sorafenib-treated MΦ revealed an induction of pyroptosis. As a result, cytotoxic NK cells become activated when cocultured with sorafenib-treated MΦ, leading to tumor cell death. In addition, sorafenib was found to down-regulate major histocompatibility complex class I expression of tumor cells, which may reduce the tumor responsiveness to immune checkpoint therapies and favor NK-cell response. In vivo cytokine blocking revealed that sorafenib efficacy is abrogated after inhibition of interleukins 1B and 18. Conclusion: We report an immunomodulatory mechanism of sorafenib involving MΦ pyroptosis and unleashing of an NK-cell response that sets it apart from other spectrum kinase inhibitors as a promising immunotherapy combination partner for the treatment of HCC.",Subcellular Duplex DNA and G-Quadruplex Interaction Profiling of a Hexagonal PtII Metallacycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002438,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 03,"Metal-driven self-assembly afforded a multitude of fascinating supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with applications as catalysts, host-guest, and stimuli-responsive systems.

Local administration of dermal ABCB5+ -derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attenuated macrophage-dominated inflammation and thereby accelerated healing of full-thickness excisional wounds in the iron-overload mouse model mimicking the nonhealing state of human venous leg ulcers. The observed beneficial effects were due to interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) secreted by ABCB5+ -derived MSCs, which dampened inflammation and shifted the prevalence of unrestrained proinflammatory M1 macrophages toward repair promoting anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages at the wound site. The beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of IL-1RA released from ABCB5+ -derived MSCs on human wound macrophages was conserved in humanized NOD-scid IL2rγ null mice. In conclusion, human dermal ABCB5+ cells represent a novel, easily accessible, and marker-enriched source of MSCs, which holds substantial promise to successfully treat chronic nonhealing wounds in humans.

Here, we have measured excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of the neurons in the central nucleus of the IC in response to stimulation of either the lateral lemniscus or the commissure of the inferior colliculus. Before hearing onset, the lemniscus inputs exhibited short-term depression, whereas commissural inputs showed facilitation. After hearing onset, the N-methyl-d-aspartate-EPSCs exhibited faster decay for both pathways, whereas the decay of the AMPA-EPSCs were unaltered. Furthermore, the EPSCs showed more constant responses during repetitive stimulation in both pathways.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) is among the most common hospital acquired infections. In SOT recipients the incidence of CDI varies by type and number or organs transplanted. While a meta-analysis of published literature found the prevalence of post-operative CDI in the general surgical population to be approximately 0.51%, the prevalence of CDI that is seen in the solid organ transplant population ranges from a low of 3.2% in the pancreatic transplant population to 12.7% in those receiving multiple organ transplants.

In Streptomyces, during sporulation, multiple Z rings are assembled and lead to formation of septa that divide a filamentous hyphal cell into tens of prespore compartments. We describe here mutant alleles of ftsZ in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces venezuelae that perturb cell division in such a way that constriction is initiated along irregular spiral-shaped paths rather than as regular septa perpendicular to the cell length axis. This conspicuous phenotype is caused by amino acid substitutions F37I and F37R in β strand S2 of FtsZ. The F37I mutation leads, instead of regular Z rings, to formation of relatively stable spiral-shaped FtsZ structures that are capable of initiating cell constriction. Further, we show that the F37 mutations affect the polymerization properties and impair the cooperativity of FtsZ assembly in vitro. The results suggest that specific residues in β strand S2 of FtsZ affect the conformational switch in FtsZ that underlies assembly cooperativity and enable treadmilling of protofilaments, and that these features are required for formation of regular Z rings. However, the data also indicate FtsZ-directed cell constriction is not dependent on assembly cooperativity.",4D flow imaging with 2D-selective excitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002417,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 06 11,"4D flow MRI permits to quantify non-invasively time-dependent velocity vector fields, but it demands long acquisition times. 2D-selective excitation allows to accelerate the acquisition by reducing the FOV in both phase encoding directions.

At the same time, there are abundant and sophisticated endogenous and exogenous substances that can affect macrophage heterogeneity.

Historically, after-school research has focused on behavior management and social-emotional learning, relying on traditional evidence-based interventions designed for and tested in schools. However, after-school workforce and resource limitations interfere with adoption of empirically supported strategies and youth health promotion. We have engaged in practice-based research with urban after-school programs in economically vulnerable communities for nearly two decades, toward building a resource-efficient, empirically informed multitiered model of workforce support.

Sequential compartmental modeling described drug disposition in blood and semen. Our modeling suggests slower elimination of apparent tenofovir-diphosphate PBMC and faster elimination of tenofovir SP after administration of TAF compared with TDF, likely reflecting flip-flop kinetics. Additionally, TAF metabolism to tenofovir appeared slower in semen compared with blood; however, SP elimination of TAF-derived tenofovir appeared faster than its blood plasma elimination.

Despite the wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological effects, its effect may be limited its lipophobic properties. Therefore, strategies to improve the access of BTA to the cells are required to enhance the anticancer effects. Electroporation (EP) enables increased inflow of drugs into cancer cells, even at low doses, which may reduce the side effects caused by high doses of chemotherapy. The potential application of BTA in electrochemotherapy (ECT) in metastatic type of cancers was investigated in the present study. The efficacy of BTA with EP was estimated using a cell survival assay (MTT assay), microscopical morphology analysis and the immunocytochemical expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are molecules that protect the cell from harmful environmental, chemical and physical stresses, and ensure cell survival, recovery and proper functioning. HSP expression is induced various stress factors. Therefore, the expression of HSP27 and HSP70 was evaluated after cells were exposed to an external pulsed electric field and anticancer drugs. Facilitated drug delivery and the anticancer effect on metastatic tumor cells were evaluated in vitro. The effect of BTA was compared with cisplatin (CP), a standard cytostatic agent. Two different metastatic cancer cell lines were used, an ovary adenocarcinoma cell line (SW626) and melanoma cell line (Me45). BTA combined with EP exhibited similar efficacy to CP with EP after 24 and 48 h in SW626 and Me45 cancer cells. Me45 cells also had high HSP27 and low HSP70 immunosignals post‑ECT treatment. ECT caused increased expression of HSP27 and HSP70 proteins in SW626 cells, which were less sensitive to ECT than the Me45 melanoma cell line. The results indicate that BTA may be efficiently applied instead of CP in ECT approaches, but its activity differs between tumor cell lines.",JS‑K induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in A549 and H460 cells via the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002373,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, with high mortality and morbidity rates. O2‑​(2,4‑​dinitrophenyl)‑1‑​[(4‑ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin‑1‑yl]diazen‑1‑ium‑1,2‑diolate (JS‑K) is a potent anticancer agent that acts against a subset of human non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines; however, the underlying mechanisms of JS‑K in NSCLC remain unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the anticancer effect of JS‑K and investigate its underlying mechanisms in A549 and H460 cells. In the present study, A549 and H460 cells were treated with JS‑K, and then evaluated by cell viability assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. JS‑K markedly induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in a concentration and time‑dependent manner in both cell lines. This was associated with increased expression levels of p53, and the cell cycle inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1, which, in turn, inhibited the expression of Cdc2, cyclin B1 and cyclin‑dependent kinase 2. In addition, JS‑K‑induced inhibition of proliferation was revealed to be partially modulated by the upregulation of p53 and p21WAF1, the ratio of Bax/Bcl‑2, and the activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in A549 and H460 cells. These results demonstrated that JS‑K could trigger cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis in A549 and H460 cells, which was likely mediated via the p53/p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 pathways. Overall, the results indicated that JS‑K may be used as an anticancer agent for the treatment of NSCLC.","Synergistic effect of arsenic trioxide, vismodegib and temozolomide on glioblastoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002372,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"The treatment of glioblastoma is a critical health issue, owing to its resistance to chemotherapy. The current standard of treatment is surgical resection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment. Long‑term local treatment of glioblastoma is rarely achieved and the majority of the patients undergo relapse. Resistance to temozolomide emerges from numerous signalling pathways that are altered in glioblastoma, including the Hedgehog signalling pathway. Hence, further research is required to identify effective treatment modalities. We investigated the effect of vismodegib, arsenic trioxide and temozolomide on glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo to apply our findings to the clinical setting. WST‑1 assay revealed that glioblastoma proliferation was inhibited following treatment with these drugs either in single or in combination; this synergistic effect was confirmed by CalcuSyn software. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in the expression of cleaved caspase‑3 and γH2AX. Furthermore, there was marked inhibition and decreased tumour growth in mice that received combination therapy, unlike those that received single agent or vehicle treatment. Our results revealed that the combination of arsenic trioxide/vismodegib and temozolomide may be an attractive therapeutic method for the treatment of glioblastoma.",miR‑145‑5p is associated with pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and impairs cell proliferation by targeting TGFβR2 in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002371,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Cancer patients who better benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NeoCh) are those who achieve a successful pathological complete response (pCR) represented by the absence of residual disease. Unfortunately, no highly sensitive and specific tumor biomarkers for predicting the clinical response to NeoCh have yet been defined. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether miR‑145‑5p could discriminate between pCR and no‑pCR in triple‑negative breast cancer patients that received a cisplatin/doxorubicin‑based neoadjuvant treatment. miR‑145‑5p expression was determined in breast tumors by quantitative RT‑PCR. Our data showed that miR‑145‑5p had a significant low expression (P<0.005) in patients that achieved pCR in comparison to the non‑responder group. Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that low levels of miR‑145‑5p were associated with increased disease‑free survival. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that miR‑145‑5p is a good predictor of pCR (P<0.003, AUC=0.7899, 95% CI, 0.6382‑0.9416). Quantitative RT‑PCR expression analysis also revealed that miR‑145‑5p was downregulated in four breast cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. To study the functions of miR‑145‑5p, its expression was restored in triple‑negative MDA‑MB‑231 cells and its effects in cell proliferation were evaluated by MTT assays and in apoptosis using Annexin V experiments. Data revealed that ectopic expression of miR‑145‑5p resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and also induced apoptosis. Moreover, miR‑145‑5p led to sensitization of breast cancer cells to cisplatin therapy. In addition, western blot assays indicated that miR‑145‑5p downregulated the TGFβR2 protein. In conclusion, miR‑145‑5p could be a potential biomarker of clinical response to NeoCh in triple‑negative breast cancer. Functionally miR‑145‑5p may regulate cell proliferation, at least in part, by targeting TGFβR2.",Long non‑coding RNA RP1‑163G9.1 is downregulated in gastric adenocarcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002370,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression, function and underlying molecular mechanism of the long non‑coding (lnc) RNA RP1‑163G9.1 in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). The expression levels of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 were determined in 112 paired clinical GA tissues by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Subsequently, the potential clinical values of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 were analyzed with statistical methods. Additionally, the function of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 was explored at the cellular level using the Cell Counting Kit‑8 proliferation assay, Transwell experiments, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the function of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 was assessed in vivo using subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiments in nude mice. lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 expression in GA tissues and cells was significantly decreased when compared with that in control gastric tissues (P<0.001) or gastric epithelial cells GES‑1 (P<0.05). This finding was associated with the depth of invasion (P=0.001), lymph node metastasis (P=0.009), tumor size (P=0.037) and immunocytochemistry marker Ki‑67 (P=0.010). FISH detection demonstrated that lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 was primarily located in the cytoplasm. Notably, overexpression of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 significantly decreased cell proliferation (P<0.01), colony formation (P<0.01), invasion (P<0.01) and the number of cells at the S‑phase of the cell cycle (P<0.05); However, it did not exert a significant effect on apoptosis (P>0.05). Furthermore, tumor formation experiments revealed that overexpression of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 inhibited cancer cell proliferation in nude mice. The present research indicated that low expression of lncRNA RP1‑163G9.1 may be associated with enhanced tumor proliferation and invasion in GA.",Single‑cell intratumoral stemness analysis reveals the involvement of cell cycle and DNA damage repair in two different types of esophageal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002369,Oncology reports,2019 05 14,"Intratumoral heterogeneity, particularly the potential cancer stemness of single cancer cells, has not yet been fully elucidated in human esophageal cancer. Single‑cell transcriptome sequencing of two types of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and two types of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues was performed, and the intratumoral cancer stemness of the types of esophageal cancer were characterized at the single‑cell level in the present study. By comparing the transcriptomic profiles of single cancer cells with high and low stemness in individual patients, it was revealed that the overexpression of cell cycle‑associated genes in EAC cells was highly correlated with stemness, whereas overexpression of genes involved in the signaling pathways of DNA replication and DNA damage repair was significantly correlated with stemness in ESCC. High expression of these stemness‑associated genes was correlated with poor prognosis of patients. Additionally, poly [ADP‑ribose] polymerase(PARP)4 was identified as a novel cancer stemness‑associated gene in ESCC and its association with survival was validated in a cohort of 121 patients with ESCC. These findings have profound potential implications for the use of cell cycle inhibitors in EAC and PARP inhibitors in ESCC, which may provide novel mechanistic insights into the plasticity of esophageal cancer.",Cellular response to glutamine and/or glucose deprivation in in vitro transformed human fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002368,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Neoplastic transformation is characterized by metabolic rewiring to sustain the elevated biosynthetic demands of highly proliferative cancer cells. To obtain the precursors for macromolecule biosynthesis, cancer cells avidly uptake and metabolize glucose and glutamine. Thus, targeting the availability or metabolism of these nutrients is an attractive anticancer therapeutic strategy. To improve our knowledge concerning how cancer cells respond to nutrient withdrawal, the response to glutamine and/or glucose starvation was studied in human in vitro transformed fibroblasts, deeply characterized at the cellular and molecular level. Concomitant starvation of both nutrients led to rapid loss of cellular adhesion (~16 h after starvation), followed by cell death. Deprivation of glucose alone had the same effect, although at a later time (~48 h after starvation), suggesting that glucose plays a key role in enabling cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Glutamine deprivation did not induce rapid cell death, but caused a prolonged arrest of cellular proliferation; the cells started dying only 96 h after starvation. Before massive cell death occurred, the effects of all the starvation conditions were reversible. Autophagy activation was observed in cells incubated in the absence of glucose for more than 48 h, while autophagy was not detected under the other starvation conditions. Markers of apoptotic cell death, such as caspase 3, caspase 9 and poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP‑1) proteolytic fragments, were not observed under any growth condition. Glucose and/or glutamine deprivation caused very rapid PARP‑1 activation, with marked PARP‑1 (poly‑ADP) ribosylation and protein (poly‑ADP) ribosylation. This activation was not due to starvation‑induced DNA double‑strand breaks, which appeared at the late stages of deprivation, when most cells died. Collectively, these results highlight a broad range of consequences of glucose and glutamine starvation, which may be taken into account when nutrient availability is used as a target for anticancer therapies."

However, the clinical relevance and role of calpain‑1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) are unclear. Filamin A (FLNA) is an actin‑binding protein that participates in cancer progression and can be cleaved by calpain‑1. In the present study, the protein expression levels of calpain‑1 and FLNA were detected by immunohistochemistry in 467 matched cancerous and paracancerous tissues from patients with CRC. The staining results and the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were comprehensively analyzed. A high expression level of calpain‑1 was strongly associated with age, metastasis, Dukes stage and survival time but not with sex, histologic grade, tumour location or tumor size. By contrast, a low expression level of FLNA was significantly associated with tumor size, histological grade, metastasis, Dukes stage and survival time, but not with age, sex, or tumor location. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with calpain‑1 overexpression had a shorter mean overall survival (OS) than patients with lower levels of calpain‑1 expression. Unlike high levels of calpain‑1, high levels of FLNA were associated with longer OS than lower levels of FLNA expression. Furthermore, calpain‑1 expression was inversely correlated with FLNA expression. The relationship between calpain‑1 and FLNA was further confirmed using CRC cell lines in vitro. When calpain‑1 expression decreased in CRC cells, FLNA expression increased. Furthermore, calpain‑1 knockdown in CRC cells resulted in decreased proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. The present findings suggest that calpain‑1 overexpression predicted a poor outcome in patients with CRC and promoted tumor progression, possibly via FLNA downregulation.",Methylation of the promoter region of the MTRR gene in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002356,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Epigenetic analysis of the association between the methylation status of the promoter region of the MTRR (5‑methyltetrahydrofolate‑homocysteine methyltransferase reductase) gene and the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children plays an important role in the early diagnosis, assessment of the malignant degree, treatment and evaluation of the risk of relapse and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, RT‑qPCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of the MTRR and MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) genes in the bone marrow of 20 ALL patients and 20 age‑ and sex‑matched controls with normal bone marrow. The methylation pattern of the MTRR promoter region in eligible DNA samples was quantitatively analyzed using MALDI‑TOF MS. The results indicated that the mRNA expression level of MTRR in the bone marrow from children with ALL was lower than that in the control samples (P<0.05), but no significant difference was detected in the MTHFR gene between the two groups (P>0.05). According to the risk classification of ALL in children with high, medium and low risk, the low‑risk group had a higher methylation rate of CpG_6 compared to the medium‑risk group. However, the medium‑risk group had a higher CpG_46.47 methylation rate compared to the low‑risk group. The methylation rates of CpG_26 and CpG_46.47 in the high‑risk group were higher than these rates in the low‑risk group, while the CpG_42.23.44 methylation rate was lower in the high‑risk group than in the low‑risk group (P<0.05). The methylation rates at CpG_1, CpG_10, CpG_48 sites, score and the average methylation rate in the ALL‑H (high) group (≥50x109/l) were lower than these in the ALL‑NH (not high) group (<50x109/l) and the control group (P<0.05). We conclude that abnormal MTRR mRNA expression and the methylation of the MTRR promoter can be used to classify the risk of ALL in children.",Dynamic contrast enhanced‑magnetic resonance imaging for the early evaluation of the response to docetaxel in rats with epithelial ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002355,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Dynamic contrast enhanced‑magnetic resonance imaging (DCE‑MRI) contributes to the early detection and prediction of responses to chemotherapy in cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of quantitative DCE‑MRI parameters for noninvasively predicting the early response to DTX in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In the present study, using 7,12‑dimethylbenz (A) anthracene, orthotopic EOC was induced in Sprague Dawley rats. Rats with EOC were treated with docetaxel (DTX) on day 0. DCE‑MRI was applied on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21. On day 21, the treated tumor types were categorized into sensitive and insensitive groups according to their change in size. Quantitative DCE‑MRI parameters were used to assess the early response to therapy. The experiment was performed again, the treatment group was divided into sensitive and insensitive groups according to their initially obtained cut-off values, and histopathological analyses were performed. Comparing the sensitive group with the insensitive group, there were significant differences in the percentage change in the volume transfer constant (Ktrans), rate constant (kep) and initial area under the curve (IAUC) from day 3 and tumor size from day 14. During the early stages of treatment (on day 3), the percentage change of Ktrans combined with kep produced an AUC of 1, and a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 100%, respectively, using a cut-off value of a 17.59% reduction in Ktrans and kep. From day 7, there were significant differences in the quantitative index percentage change in angiogenesis in the sensitive group compared with the insensitive group. The percentage change in Ktrans, kep and IAUC were positively correlated with the percentage of change in tumor size and angiogenesis, and negatively correlated with the percentage of change in necrosis. The results of the present study indicated that quantitative DCE‑MRI parameters were superior to imaging tumor size for the early detection and prediction of the response to DTX chemotherapy in EOC.",DNA methylation of metallothionein genes is associated with the clinical features of renal cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002354,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Metallothioneins are low‑weight cysteine‑rich proteins responsible for metal ion homeostasis in a cell and, thus, capable of regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Deregulation of metallothionein genes has been reported in various human tumors. However, their role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been poorly investigated. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the importance of promoter DNA methylation of selected metallothionein genes for RCC. Based on the initial analysis of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas, genes MT1E, MT1F, MT1G and MT1M were selected for qualitative methylation analysis in 30 tumors (including 10 multifocal cases), 10 pericancerous, and 30 non‑cancerous renal tissues (NRT). Methylation of MT1E and MT1M was tumor‑specific (P=0.0056 and P=0.0486, respectively) and showed moderate interfocal variation in paired tumor foci. Methylated promoter status of the two genes was associated with larger tumor size (P=0.0110 and P=0.0156, respectively). Furthermore, aberrant MT1E methylation was more frequent in tumors having necrotic zones (P=0.0449) or characterized with higher differentiation grade (P=0.0144), while MT1M was more commonly methylated in tumors with higher Fuhrman grade (P=0.0272). Only unmethylated MT1F promoter status was observed in all analyzed samples. Gene expression analysis (51 RCC and 9 NRT) revealed MT1G downregulation in tumors (P<0.0001), while lower MT1E expression levels were associated with the promoter methylation (P=0.0077). In clear cell RCC, MT1E, MT1G and MT1M expression was higher than that noted in other histological tumor subtypes (all P<0.0500). In addition, some associations were observed between metabolic syndrome‑related clinical parameters and promoter methylation or gene expression. In conclusion, the present study revealed the potential role of MT1E and MT1M promoter methylation in RCC development.",Effects of ginsenoside Rg3 on epigenetic modification in ovarian cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002353,Oncology reports,2019 05 14,"Epigenetic modifications are closely related to oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ginsenoside Rg3 on epigenetic modification in ovarian cancer cells. Cell proliferation, metastasis, invasion and apoptosis were respectively determined using Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8), wound healing, Transwell and flow cytometric assays. Methylation levels were determined using methylation specific PCR (MSP). Related‑factor expression was detected by conducting real‑time‑qPCR (RT‑qPCR) and western blotting. The results revealed that cell proliferation was inhibited by ginsenoside Rg3 (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml) in a time‑dependent manner (12, 24 and 48 h). Ginsenoside Rg3 (50, 100 and 200 µg/ml) was selected to treat cells in various experiments. When ovarian cells were treated with ginsenoside Rg3, cell apoptosis was observed to be promoted, while cell metastasis and invasion were inhibited at 48 h. The results of the present study revealed that in the promoter regions of p53, p16 and hMLH1, the methylation levels decreased, while the mRNA and protein levels significantly increased. The activities of DNMTs and mRNA as well as protein levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b were decreased by Rg3. The data also demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of acetyl‑H3 K14/K9 and acetyl‑H4 K12/K5/K16 were increased by Rg3. Hence, ginsenoside Rg3 inhibited ovarian cancer cell viability, migration and invasion as well as promoted cell apoptosis.","1α,25‑Dihydroxyvitamin D3 restrains stem cell‑like properties of ovarian cancer cells by enhancing vitamin D receptor and suppressing CD44.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002352,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Scientific evidence linking vitamin D with various cancer types is growing, but the effects of vitamin D on ovarian cancer stem cell‑like cells (CSCs) are largely unknown. The present study aimed to examine whether vitamin D was able to restrain the stemness of ovarian cancer. A side population (SP) from malignant ovarian surface epithelial cells was identified as CSCs, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 1α,25‑dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3] treatment inhibited the self‑renewal capacity of SP cells by decreasing the sphere formation rate and by suppressing the mRNA expression levels of cluster of differentiation CD44, NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, Krüppel‑like factor 4 and adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily G member 2. Additionally, 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment decreased the expression of Cyclin D1, whereas it increased the expression of β‑catenin and vitamin D receptor (VDR). Notably, immunofluorescence staining verified that 1α,25(OH)2D3 promoted the expression of β‑catenin in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, vitamin D3 delayed the onset of tumor formation derived from injection of ovarian CSCs to nude mice, by reducing CD44 and enhancing β‑catenin expressions in vivo. In conclusion, 1α,25(OH)2D3 restrains the stem cell‑like properties of ovarian cancer cells by enhancing the expression of VDR, by promoting the expression of β‑catenin in the cytoplasm, and by suppressing the expression of CD44. These findings provide a novel insight into the functions of vitamin D in diminishing the stemness of cancer CSCs.",TRIM52 regulates the proliferation and invasiveness of lung cancer cells via the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002351,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"As a major cause of cancer‑associated mortalities, lung cancer is frequently diagnosed in males and females with an incidence ratio of 2.1:1. Tripartite motif 52 (TRIM52), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been reported to be involved in various biological functions, including cell proliferation and invasiveness. In the present study, an elevated TRIM52 level was observed in tumor tissues of patients with lung cancer and in lung cancer cell lines. The downregulation of TRIM52 in lung cancer cells significantly suppressed the proliferation of lung cancer cells, arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase and was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of β‑catenin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, c‑Myc and Cyclin D1 proteins. Additionally, TRIM52‑induced cell proliferation and invasiveness, as well as the levels of cell cycle‑associated proteins, were completely counteracted by the Wnt/β‑catenin inhibitor XAV939. Based on these data, it was speculated that TRIM52 is critical for lung cancer progression and that downregulation of TRIM52 could inhibit cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression. It was also speculated that TRIM52 upregulation promotes proliferation and invasiveness through activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Thus, TRIM52 has the potential to be a therapeutic target for lung cancer.",Upregulated histamine receptor H3 promotes tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002350,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Histamine receptor H3 (HRH3) is mainly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is involved in the regulation of the release of various neurotransmitters in the brain. Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of HRH3 is upregulated in several types of cancer. However, the functional effect of HRH3 on tumor progression remains largely unknown, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, the expression of HRH3 in 96 HCC patients was first evaluated, and its clinical significance was analyzed. Subsequently, the functional roles of HRH3 in HCC growth and metastasis were systematically explored in vitro and in vivo using its agonist (imetit) or antagonist (clobenpropit). It was observed that HRH3 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, while its expression was significantly associated with recurrence‑free survival and overall survival in HCC patients. Functional experiments also demonstrated that HRH3 upregulation facilitated the growth and metastasis of HCC cells by inducing the formation of lamellipodia. These findings revealed that HRH3 serves an important role in the growth and metastasis of HCC cells, which provides experimental evidence supporting the application of HRH3 as a potential therapeutic target in HCC treatment.","Propofol may increase caspase and MAPK pathways, and suppress the Akt pathway to induce apoptosis in MA‑10 mouse Leydig tumor cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002349,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"In the western world, there is an increasing trend of occurrence in testicular cancer. Treatment of malignant testicular cancer is primarily combined surgery with various chemical drugs. Propofol has been frequently used as an anesthetic and sedative induction agent, which could modulate different γ‑aminobutyric acid receptors in the central nervous system. Studies demonstrated that propofol activates endoplasmic reticulum stress to induce apoptosis in lung cancer. However, it remains elusive whether propofol regulates caspase and/or mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to induce apoptosis in Leydig tumor cells. In the present study, MA‑10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were treated with propofol, and possible signal pathways associated with apoptosis were investigated. Results demonstrated that increasing dosage of propofol (300‑600 µM) for 24 h significantly decreased cell viability in MA‑10 cells (P<0.05). In flow cytometry analysis, the amount of sub‑G1 phase cell numbers in MA‑10 cells was significantly increased by propofol (P<0.05). Additionally, Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining further confirmed that propofol could induce MA‑10 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, cleaved caspase‑8, ‑9 and ‑3, and/or poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase were significantly activated following treatment of propofol in MA‑10 cells. In addition, c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase, extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2, and p38 were significantly activated by propofol in MA‑10 cells (P<0.05), indicating that propofol may induce apoptosis through the MAPK pathway. Additionally, propofol diminished the phosphorylation of Akt to activate apoptosis in MA‑10 cells. In conclusion, propofol may induce MA‑10 cell apoptosis by activating caspase and MAPK pathways, and inhibiting the Akt pathway in MA‑10 cells, demonstrating that propofol may be a potential anticancer agent against Leydig cell cancer.",Acquisition of gemcitabine resistance enhances angiogenesis via upregulation of IL‑8 production in pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002348,Oncology reports,2019 04 24,"Gemcitabine (Gem) is widely used as chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer (PaCa), but its effect is not fully satisfactory. One of the reasons for this is the acquisition of Gem resistance (Gem‑R). To elucidate the mechanism of Gem‑R, two Gem‑R PaCa cell lines were established from AsPC‑1 and MIA PaCa‑2 cells. It was demonstrated that expression of interleukin‑8 (IL‑8) mRNA was significantly upregulated in Gem‑R PaCa cells by cDNA microarray and RT‑qPCR analyses. Increased IL‑8 secretion by Gem‑R cells was confirmed by cytokine array and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, we found that co‑culture with Gem‑R PaCa cells significantly enhanced tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and treatment with an anti‑CXCR2 (main receptor for IL‑8) antibody significantly prevented this effect. We previously reported that a chemokine network centered on the IL‑8/CXCR2 axis plays an important role in PaCa angiogenesis, and suppression of this axis has an antitumor effect. Since acquisition of Gem‑R increased IL‑8 production and consequently increased tumor angiogenesis, the IL‑8/CXCR2 axis may be a potential novel therapeutic target for PaCa after acquiring Gem‑R."

Parthenocarpy was found to be partially dominant, and a single major quantitative trait locus on linkage group 22 was found to control the trait in a doubled haploid mapping population derived from a cross between parthenocarpic cigar tobacco cultivar 'Beinhart 1000' and non-parthenocarpic flue-cured tobacco cultivar, 'Hicks.'

Following extensive use of AGs in humans, food-producing animals and companion animals, acquired resistance among human and animal pathogens and commensal bacteria has emerged. Acquired resistance occurs through several mechanisms, but enzymatic inactivation of AGs is the most common one. Resistance genes are often located on mobile genetic elements, facilitating their spread between different bacterial species and between animals and humans. AG resistance has been found in many different bacterial species, including those with zoonotic potential such as Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and livestock-associated MRSA. The highest risk is anticipated from transfer of resistant enterococci or coliforms (Escherichia coli) since infections with these pathogens in humans would potentially be treated with AGs. There is evidence that the use of AGs in human and veterinary medicine is associated with the increased prevalence of resistance. The same resistance genes have been found in isolates from humans and animals. Evaluation of risk factors indicates that the probability of transmission of AG resistance from animals to humans through transfer of zoonotic or commensal foodborne bacteria and/or their mobile genetic elements can be regarded as high, although there are no quantitative data on the actual contribution of animals to AG resistance in human pathogens. Responsible use of AGs is of great importance in order to safeguard their clinical efficacy for human and veterinary medicine.",Systematic review: components of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in inflammatory bowel disease - a potentially promising but often neglected risk stratification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002331,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,2019 04 19,"The population of older patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing.

Body composition, muscle mass and muscle histology were remarkably stable over 18 years of advanced aging in S. Analysis of genes involved in muscle remodeling showed that S had higher mRNA levels of myogenic differentiation factors (Myogenin, MyoD), embryonic myosin (eMyHC), enzymes involved in regulated breakdown of myofibrillar proteins (Smad2, Trim32, MuRF1,) and NCAM compared with healthy adult men (n = 8). S also had higher mRNA levels of eMyHC, Smad 2, MuRF1 compared with NS. At 88 years, S expressed decreased levels of Myogenin, MyoD, eMyHC, NCAM and Smad2 towards those seen in NS at 70 years. The gene expression pattern of S at 70 years was likely beneficial since they maintained muscle fiber histology and appendicular lean body mass until advanced age.

Because GH suppresses ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase phosphorylation, decreases DNA repair, and increases DNA damage accumulation, we elucidated whether GH effects on DNA damage are mediated through induced IGF-1. In nontumorous human colon cells, GH, but not IGF-1, increased DNA damage. Stably disrupted IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) by lentivirus-expressing short hairpin RNA in vitro or treatment with the IGF-1R phosphorylation inhibitor picropodophyllotoxin (PPP) in vitro and in vivo led to markedly induced GH receptor (GHR) abundance, rendering cells more responsive to GH actions. Suppressing IGF-1R triggered DNA damage in both normal human colon cells and three-dimensional human intestinal organoids. DNA damage was further increased when cells with disrupted IGF-1R were treated with GH. Because GH induction of DNA damage accumulation appeared to be mediated not by IGF-1R but probably by more abundant GH receptor expression, we injected athymic mice with GH-secreting xenografts and then treated them with PPP. In these mice, high circulating GH levels were associated with increased colon DNA damage despite disrupted IGF-1R activity (P < 0.01), whereas GHR levels were also induced. Further confirming that GH effects on DNA damage are directly mediated by GHR signaling, GHR-/- mice injected with PPP did not show increased DNA damage, whereas wild-type mice with intact GHR exhibited increased colon DNA damage in the face of IGF-1 signaling suppression. The results indicate that GH directly induces DNA damage independent of IGF-1.",Simultaneous Quantitation of Five Bioactive Ingredients in Raw and Processed Fallopia multiflora by Employing UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002309,Journal of chromatographic science,2019 04 19,"Fallopia multiflora is used for treatment of premature graying hair and blood deficiency.

NAC TFs also play important roles in fruit ripening. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), one of the best characterized NACs involved in fruit ripening is NON-RIPENING (NOR), and the non-ripening (nor) mutation has been widely used to extend fruit shelf life in elite varieties. Here, we show that NOR additionally controls leaf senescence. Expression of NOR increases with leaf age, and developmental as well as dark-induced senescence are delayed in the nor mutant, while overexpression of NOR promotes leaf senescence. Genes associated with chlorophyll degradation as well as senescence-associated genes (SAGs) show reduced and elevated expression, respectively, in nor mutants and NOR overexpressors. Overexpression of NOR also stimulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. In tomato, NOR supports senescence by directly and positively regulating the expression of several senescence-associated genes including, besides others, SlSAG15 and SlSAG113, SlSGR1, and SlYLS4. Finally, we find that another senescence control NAC TF, namely SlNAP2, acts upstream of NOR to regulate its expression. Our data support a model whereby NAC TFs have often been recruited by higher plants for both the control of leaf senescence and fruit ripening.",Predicting Outcomes from Engagement With Specific Components of an Internet-Based Physical Activity Intervention With Financial Incentives: Process Analysis of a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002304,Journal of medical Internet research,2019 05 19,Investigating participant engagement and nonusage attrition can help identify the likely active ingredients of electronic health interventions.

This study evaluated differences in substance-specific consequence attribution by alcohol-marijuana use patterns (concurrent alcohol and marijuana [CAM; use of both substances, not at same time] and simultaneous [SAM; use of both, at same time]) as well as alcohol-only (AO). First-year college students with prior alcohol use (N = 610, 50.9% women, 71% White, Mage = 18) completed an online assessment of past-three-month substance use, including SAM, and related consequences. Results indicated that polydrug (SAM and CAM) users reported greater alcohol involvement and earlier alcohol initiation than AO, and polydrug use was associated with more alcohol-related problems, including sexual risk taking and alcohol-related blackouts. When restricted to SAM/CAM users, logistic regressions indicated that SAM users reported an increased incidence in two marijuana-related problems relative to CAM (driving after using and academic difficulties), but lower rates of social problems. SAM users were also less likely to attribute substance-related social problems to alcohol.

Based on the idea that positive feelings associated with light might influence social judgements in workplaces, we propose that satisfaction with light as a specific affective response to light would lead to positive judgements of other individuals. In a laboratory experiment (N = 164), participants assessed their satisfaction with light and rated other person's faces on warmth and competence. Results showed that satisfaction with light positively influenced judgement of others. We replicated the positive relation between satisfaction with light and social judgements in a field study with employees (N = 176). These findings highlight the importance of satisfaction with light for social judgement in workplaces. We discuss theoretical contributions and practical implications concerning the design of settings involving the evaluation of other individuals. Practitioner Summary: The design of work settings where the evaluation of others takes place is an important topic. A laboratory experiment and a field study demonstrate that satisfaction with workplace illumination influences judgements of others.

This study assessed agreement between the thigh-worn activPAL and commonly used hip-worn ActiGraph accelerometer methods for assessing sedentary patterns in children. Both devices were worn by 8-12-year-olds (N = 195) for 4.6 ± 1.9 days. Two ActiGraph cut-points were applied to two epoch durations: ≤25 counts (c)/15 s, ≤75c/15s, ≤100c/60s, and ≤300c/60s. Bias, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) tested agreement between devices for total sedentary time and 11 sedentary pattern variables (usual bout duration, sedentary time accumulated in various bout durations, breaks/day, break rate, and alpha). For most sedentary pattern variables, ActiGraph 25c/15s, 75c/15s, and 100c/60s had poor ICCs, with bias and MAD >20%. ActiGraph 300c/60s had a better agreement than the other cut-points, but all ICCs were <0.587. ActiGraph underestimated sedentary time in longer bouts and usual bout duration, and overestimated sedentary time in shorter bouts, breaks/day, and alpha. For total sedentary time, ActiGraph 25c/15s, 300c/60s, and 75c/15s had good/fair ICCs, with bias and MAD <20%. Sedentary patterns derived from two commonly used ActiGraph cut-points did not appear to reflect postural changes.

The study included 10 junior elite biathletes. The measurements were taken with the Vicon system and AMTI force platform. Postural balance and rifle stability characteristics were determined at rest as well as 1 and 5 min post maximal specific physical effort which was performed on a ski ergometer and continued until exhaustion. Maximal physical effort exerted a significant effect on all examined postural sway and rifle sway characteristics. The duration of the post-exercise changes was longer than 5 minutes. Higher post-effort rifle sway was observed in the vertical direction than in the across the shooting line direction. Post-effort postural balance impairment in the shooting line was much greater than in the across the shooting line direction. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between postural balance and rifle stability. Maximal physical effort influenced postural balance and rifle stability during aiming. Rifle sway during aiming in a standing shooting position seems to be coordinated with the postural sway of the biathlete's body. Thus, an increase in postural sway contributes to greater sway and lesser stability of the rifle.",Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) depletion is protective in age-associated vascular stiffening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002285,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 04 19,"Vascular stiffening and its sequelae are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. The increasingly accepted concept of ""smooth muscle cell (SMC) stiffness syndrome"" along with matrix deposition has emerged in vascular biology to account for the mechanical phenotype of arterial aging, but the molecular targets remain elusive. In this study, using an unbiased proteomic analysis, we identified lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) as a critical SMC mediator for age-associated vascular stiffening. We tested the hypothesis that loss of LOXL2 function is protective in aging-associated vascular stiffening. We determined that exogenous and endogenous NO markedly decreased LOXL2 abundance and activity in the extracellular matrix of isolated SMCs, and LOXL2 endothelial cells suppress LOXL2 abundance in the aorta. In a longitudinal study, LOXL2+/- mice were protected from age-associated increase in pulse wave velocity, an index of vascular stiffening, as occurred in littermate wild-type (WT) mice. Using isolated aortic segments, we found that LOXL2 mediates vascular stiffening in aging by promoting SMC stiffness, augmented SMC contractility, and vascular matrix deposition. Together, these studies establish LOXL2 as a nodal point for a new therapeutic approach to treat age-associated vascular stiffening.",Chemotherapy acutely impairs neurovascular and hemodynamic responses in women with breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002284,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 06 14,"The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that doxorubicin (DX) and cyclophosphamide (CY) adjuvant chemotherapy (CHT) acutely impairs neurovascular and hemodynamic responses in women with breast cancer. Sixteen women (age: 47.0 ± 2.0 yr; body mass index: 24.2 ± 1.5 kg/m) with stage II-III breast cancer and indication for adjuvant CHT underwent two experimental sessions, saline (SL) and CHT. In the CHT session, DX (60 mg/m2) and CY (600 mg/m2) were administered over 45 min. In the SL session, a matching SL volume was infused in 45 min. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from peroneal nerve (microneurography), calf blood flow (CBF; plethysmography) and calf vascular conductance (CVC), heart rate (HR; electrocardiography), and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; finger plethysmography) were measured at rest before, during, and after each session. Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected before and after both sessions for assessment of circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs; flow cytometry), a surrogate marker for endothelial damage. MSNA and BP responses were increased (P < 0.001), whereas CBF and CVC responses were decreased (P < 0.001), during and after CHT session when compared with SL session. Interestingly, the vascular alterations were also observed at the molecular level through an increased EMP response to CHT (P = 0.03, CHT vs. SL session). No difference in HR response was observed (P > 0.05). Adjuvant CHT with DX and CY in patients treated for breast cancer increases sympathetic nerve activity and circulating EMP levels and, in addition, reduces muscle vascular conductance and elevates systemic BP. These responses may be early signs of CHT-induced cardiovascular alterations and may represent potential targets for preventive interventions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY It is known that chemotherapy regimens increase the risk of cardiovascular events in patients treated for cancer. Here, we identified that a single cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in women treated for breast cancer dramatically increases sympathetic nerve activity and circulating endothelial microparticle levels, reduces the muscle vascular conductance, and elevates systemic blood pressure.","Heat therapy vs. supervised exercise therapy for peripheral arterial disease: a 12-wk randomized, controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002283,American journal of physiology.

Volunteers with PAD were randomized to 12 wk of heat (n = 11; mean age 76 ± 8 yr, BMI 28.7 ± 3.5 kg/m2, 4 females) or exercise (n = 11; 74 ± 10 yr, 28.5 ± 6.8 kg/m2, 3 females). Heat involved spa bathing at ∼39°C, 3-5 days/wk for ≤30 min, followed by ≤30 min of callisthenics. Exercise involved ≤90 min of supervised walking and gym-based exercise, 1-2 days/wk. Following the interventions, total walking distance during a 6-min walk test increased (from ∼350 m) by 41 m (95% CI: [13, 69], P = 0.006) regardless of group, and pain-free walking distance increased (from ∼170 m) by 43 m ([22, 63], P < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure was reduced more following heat (-7 mmHg, [-4, -10], P < 0.001) than following exercise (-3 mmHg, [0, -6], P = 0.078), and diastolic and mean arterial pressure decreased by 4 mmHg in both groups (P = 0.002). There were no significant changes in blood volume, ankle-brachial index, or measures of vascular health. There were no differences in the improvement in functional or blood pressure outcomes between heat and exercise in individuals with PAD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Heat therapy via hot-water immersion and supervised exercise both improved walking distance and resting blood pressure in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients over 12 wk. Adherence to heat therapy was excellent, and the heat intervention was well tolerated. The results of the current study indicate that heat therapy can improve functional ability and has potential as an effective cardiovascular conditioning tool for individuals with PAD.","Myocardial ischemia: lack of coronary blood flow, myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance, or what?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002282,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 05 28,"This opinionated article reviews current concepts of myocardial ischemia. Specifically, the historical background is briefly presented. Then, the prevailing paradigm of myocardial oxygen-supply-demand imbalance is criticized since demand is a virtual parameter that cannot be measured and data on measurements of myocardial blood flow and contractile function rather support matching between flow and function. Finally, a concept of myocardial ischemia that focusses on the reduction of coronary blood flow to below 8-10 µl/g per beat with consequences for myocardial electrical, metabolic, contractile and morphological features is advocated."

A cross-sectional biobehavioral survey was conducted with a venue-based sample of 790 SAMs. Data were collected using questionnaires and rapid HIV tests. Cluster analysis identified five subgroups with differing levels of HIV infection (2.5% to 11.3%). In Cluster 1, most participants reported sexual abstinence over the past year and the remaining used condoms consistently; this cluster had the highest HIV prevalence (11.3%). In Cluster 2, most reported one sexual partner and all reported unprotected sex; all HIV-positive participants in this cluster were unaware of their HIV-positive status. In Clusters 3 and 4, most had four or more partners, yet all used condoms. In Cluster 3, 56.5% reported both regular and occasional partners. In Cluster 4, 74% had only occasional partners; all engaged in commercial sex. In Cluster 5, all reported four or more partners and condomless sex. In all subgroups we found low rates of HIV testing and high unawareness of HIV serostatus.

Distinctive clinical features in FTD include behavioral, affective, and cognitive symptoms. Unfortunately, little progress has been made over the past 20 years in terms of the development of effective disease-modifying drugs with the currently available symptomatic treatments having limited clinical utility. Areas covered: This article reviews the principal pharmacological intervention studies for FTD. These are predominantly randomized clinical trials and include symptomatic treatments and potential disease-modifying drugs. Expert opinion: There is insufficient evidence on effective treatments for FTD and studies with better methodological backgrounds are needed. Most studies reporting therapeutic benefits were conducted with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, while anti-dementia drugs have been ineffective in FTD. Since the underlying pathology of FTD mostly consists of abnormal tau protein or TDP-43 aggregates, treatments are being developed to interfere with their aggregation process or with the clearance of these proteins. Furthermore, disease-modifying treatments remain years away as demonstrated by the recent negative Phase III findings of a tau aggregation inhibitor (LMTM) for treating the behavioral variant of FTD. The results from current ongoing Phase I/II trials will hopefully give light to future treatment options.",Cardiac involvement in beta-thalassaemia: current treatment strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002266,Postgraduate medicine,2019 06 13,"Despite the advances in the management of thalassemia major, heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality in patients afflicted with this disorder. Cardiac involvement in thalassemia encompasses a spectrum of disorders including myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. Although cardiac siderosis (accumulation of iron in cardiac myocytes) as a consequence of repeated blood transfusions is deemed to be the main etiologic factor for myocardial dysfunction in transfusion-dependent patients, the significance of other pathophysiologic mechanisms is being increasingly recognized especially in non-transfusion dependent patients. Management of cardiac complications in thalassemia major hinges on the treatment of the underlying pathophysiology, which often is unmitigated iron overload. The prevalence and predictors of cardiac complications in 'ex-thalassaemics' [thalassaemic patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is unknown at present. In this review, we look at the pathogenesis of cardiac involvement in patients with beta-thalassemia major, the advances in the management of these patients and the future prospects.",Left Ventricular Twist Mechanics to Identify Left Ventricular Noncompaction in Childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002265,Circulation.

Recent studies in adults demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) twist is abnormal in LVNC, but it has not been investigated in pediatric patients to date. Our aim was to assess LV cardiac mechanics, LV twist, and the prevalence of rigid body rotation, using 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography, in young patients with LVNC and LV hypertrabeculation.",Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) Enhances Tissue Distribution and Prevents Excretion of nab-Paclitaxel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002261,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 06 03,"nab-Paclitaxel ( nab-P), an albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel, was developed to improve the tolerability and antitumor activity of taxanes. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a transport protein that can bind to albumin and regulate the homeostasis of circulating albumin. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nab-P may be impacted by FcRn expression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of FcRn on nab-P elimination and distribution to targeted tissues. Wild-type and FcRn-knockout (FcRn-KO) mice were treated with nab-P, mouse-specific nab-P (distribution experiments only), and solvent-based paclitaxel (pac-T). Blood and tissue samples were collected for distribution analyses. Organ, urine, and fecal samples were collected for elimination analyses. The nab-P tissue penetration in the pancreas, fat pad, and kidney of wild-type mice, as reflected by the ratio of tissue/plasma concentration, was significantly higher (ranging from 5 to 80 fold) than that of FcRn-KO mice. In contrast, the tissue penetration of pac-T in these organs of FcRn-KO mice was similar to that of wild-type mice. More importantly, the excretion of nab-P in feces of FcRn-KO mice (45-68%) was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice (26-46%) from 8 to 48 h post treatment. In comparison, the difference of excretion of pac-T in feces between FcRn-KO mice and wild-type mice was smaller than that of nab-P. Furthermore, greater tissue penetration and fecal excretion were observed with nab-P than pac-T in both FcRn-KO and wild-type mice. These findings suggest that FcRn enhances the tissue distribution and penetration of nab-P in the targeted organs, while FcRn prevents excretion of nab-P to feces in the intestinal lumen. The findings support the notion that albumin nanoparticle delivery alters drug distribution and elimination through an FcRn-mediated process to impact drug efficacy and toxicity.","In Situ Ligand Transformation for Two-Step Spin Crossover in FeII[MIV(CN)8]4- (M = Mo, Nb) Cyanido-Bridged Frameworks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002260,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 08,"We report a unique synthetic route toward the multistep spin crossover (SCO) effect induced by utilizing the partial ligand transformation during the crystallization process, which leads to the incorporation of three different FeII complexes into a single coordination framework. The 3-acetoxypyridine (3-OAcpy) molecules were introduced to the self-assembled FeII-[MIV(CN)8]4- (M = Mo, Nb) system in the aqueous solution which results in the partial hydrolysis of the ligand into 3-hydroxypyridine (3-OHpy). It gives two novel isostructural three-dimensional {FeII2(3-OAcpy)5(3-OHpy)3[MIV(CN)8]}· nH2O (M = Mo, n = 0, FeMo; M = Nb, n = 1, FeNb) coordination frameworks. They exhibit an unprecedented cyanido-bridged skeleton composed of {Fe3M2} n coordination nanotubes bonded by additional Fe complexes. These frameworks contain three types of Fe sites differing in the attached organic ligands, [Fe1(3-OAcpy)4(μ-NC)2], [Fe2(3-OHpy)4(μ-NC)2], and [Fe3(3-OAcpy)3(3-OHpy)(μ-NC)2], which lead to the thermal two-step FeII SCO, as proven by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, UV-vis-NIR optical absorption, and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy studies. The first step of SCO, going from room temperature to the 150-170 K range with transition temperatures of 245(5) and 283(5) K for FeMo and FeNb, respectively, is related to Fe1 sites, while the second step, occurring at the 50-140 K range with transition temperatures of 70(5) and 80(5) K for FeMo and FeNb, respectively, is related to Fe2 sites. The Fe3 site with both 3-OAcpy and 3-OHpy ligands does not undergo the SCO at all. The observed two-step SCO phenomenon is explained by the differences in the ligand field strength of the Fe complexes and the role of their alignment in the coordination framework. The simultaneous application of two related pyridine derivatives is the efficient synthetic route for the multistep FeII SCO in the cyanido-bridged framework which is a promising step toward rational design of advanced spin transition molecular switches.","Sulfur-Containing, Quinodimethane-Embedded Acene Analogue with Nine Consecutively Fused Six-Membered Rings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002259,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"Linear quinodimethane-embedded acene analogue 9L was synthesized, and its quinoidal structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.

Atomically resolved structural characterization of phenanthridine/carbazole GNR heterojunctions was performed using bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and first-principles calculations reveal that carbazole and phenanthridine dopant configurations induce opposite upward and downward orbital energy shifts owing to their different electron affinities. The magnitude of the energy offsets observed in carbazole/phenanthridine heterojunctions is dependent on the length of the GNR segments comprising each heterojunction with longer segments leading to larger heterojunction energy offsets. Using a new on-site energy analysis based on Wannier functions, we find that the origin of this behavior is a charge transfer process that reshapes the electrostatic potential profile over a long distance within the GNR heterojunction."

This might be alleviated if protein-binding proanthocyanidins are present in aerial parts of alfalfa forage in adequate amounts. The Lc (bHLH) and C1 (MYB) genes of maize are transcription factors known to be collectively involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Lc and C1 gene transformations on the proanthocyanidin content, nutrient composition, and degradation characteristics of proteins and carbohydrates by comparing the transgenic alfalfa with its parental nontransgenic (NT) alfalfa and commercial AC-Grazeland cultivar. The DNA extracted from transgenic plants was tested for the presence of respective transgenes by amplification with specific primers of respective transgenes using PCR. Both Lc-single and LcC1-double transgenic alfalfa accumulated both monomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins with total proanthocyanidins ranging from ca. 460 to 770 μg/g of DM. The C1-transgenic alfalfa did not accumulate proanthocyanidins similar to NT alfalfa. The C1 gene increased the NPN content significantly only in C1-single and Lc1C1-double transgenic alfalfa. The LcC1 combination seemed to have a synergic effect on reducing sugar in alfalfa. In contrast, the Lc gene appears to have a negative effect on starch content. The C1 gene tended to lower the PB3 content irrespective of the presence of the Lc gene. Although the cotransformation of Lc and C1 increased the total N/CHO ratio compared to Lc single gene transformation, the total N/CHO ratio of transgenic alfalfa was not significantly different from NT. In conclusion, Lc-bHLH single and LcC1 double gene transformation resulted in the accumulation of proanthocyanidins and affected the chemical profiles in alfalfa, which altered ruminal degradation patterns and impacted the nutrient availability of alfalfa in ruminant livestock systems.",On-Water Cp*Ir(III)-Catalyzed C-H Functionalization for the Synthesis of Chromones through Annulation of Salicylaldehydes with Diazo-Ketones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002245,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 05 17,A high-valent Ir(III)-catalyzed C-H bond functionalization is carried out for the first time on water for the synthesis of a biologically relevant chromone moiety.

The pools, which are representative of the general noninstitutionalized population of the United States, encompassed thirty-two demographic groups defined by sex, race/ethnicity (Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and all other race/ethnicities), and age (12-19, >20-39, >40-59, and ≥60 years). The adjusted geometric means were determined in a multiple linear regression model for the six congeners (BDE28, BDE47, BDE99, BDE100, BDE153, and BB153) with detectable concentrations in at least 60% of pools in each of the thirty-two demographic groups; the level of significance for all statistical comparisons thereof were determined. BDE154 and BDE209 were detected in 60% of the NHANES 2011/12 and 2013/14 pools; only these two survey periods were evaluated for these congeners. The percent change in concentration by a 2-year survey period was calculated. All examined PBDEs reported in five survey periods decreased in concentration, except BDE153, for which concentrations increased by 12.0% (95% CI 7.1-16.4) and 8.4% (95% CI 2.9-14.1) for the age groups 40-59 and ≥60 years, respectively; no significant change was observed in younger age groups. Excluding BDE153, we observed larger percentage decreases by a 2-year survey period for the age groups 12-19, 20-39, and ≥60 years compared with the age group 40-59 years. The percentage decrease by a two-year survey period ranged between -19.6% (BDE99, 20-39 years old) and -4.5% (BDE100, 40-59 years old). Although five polybrominated diphenyl ether (PDBE) congeners and BB153 are still frequently detected in the U.S. general population, PBDE concentrations have decreased since 2005-2006, likely, because of changes in manufacturing practices that started in the mid-2000s.","How Do Richness and Composition of Diet Shape Trace Metal Exposure in a Free-Living Generalist Rodent, Apodemus sylvaticus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002242,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 23,"Exposure of terrestrial mammals to chemical contaminants like trace metals (TMs) is considered to be mainly based on trophic transfer. Although relationships between TM transfer to animals and identity of contaminated food have been studied, the variation of the TM transfer with respect to diet diversity has been poorly documented. In this study, the oral exposure to TMs of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus was investigated with respect to both the number of different items, i.e., diet richness, and the identity of items determined by metabarcoding from their stomach content, i.e., diet composition. The results showed that consuming Salicaceae, a known cadmium accumulator plant family, significantly increased exposure to cadmium and zinc. However, an increase in diet richness minimized exposure to cadmium when mice consumed Salicaceae items. This strongly suggests that TM accumulator items can lead to a high oral exposure to TMs but that such high exposure due to TM accumulator items can be "" diluted"" by diet richness due to other low accumulator items. Our results clearly indicate that both the presence of certain items in the diet and diet richness are important determinants of exposure to TMs in generalist animals, which matches the predictions of the "" diet dilution hypothesis"".",Shedding Light on the Intrinsic Characteristics of 3D Distorted Fluorite-Type Zirconium Tellurite Single Crystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002241,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 12,"Transition-metal tellurites have motivated growing research interest in both fundamental and applied chemistry, and the corresponding single crystals could serve as rich and fascinating platforms to regulate, explore, and elucidate the intrinsic characteristics of different structures from 0D to 3D architectures. In this context, a zirconium tellurite (namely, ZrTe3O8) single crystal featuring a 3D distorted fluorite-type structure with a size of 35 × 32 × 21 mm3 was successfully harvested by the top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) technique. The X-ray diffraction rocking curve reflects that the crystallinity of the as-grown ZrTe3O8 crystal is quite perfect with a small full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) value (∼39 arcsec). The temperature dependence of the thermophysical properties of the ZrTe3O8 single crystal has been systematically analyzed. The ZrTe3O8 single crystal exhibits a wide transparency window, as the UV and IR absorption cutoff edges are respectively 278 and 7788 nm. The refractive indices over the region from the visible to the near-IR have been determined and manifested relatively large values of 2.0889-2.0370 over a wavelength range of 632.8-1553 nm.

Developing a method for fabricating thin films of 2D metal oxides is crucial for minimizing the negative effects on sensing performance caused by slow diffusion. In this work, a simple, versatile, and highly reproducible self-assembly method is developed for fabricating monolayer film sensors made from metal oxide nanosheets with much superior sensing performance compared with their thick film counterparts. To prepare the monolayer film sensors, a monolayer film of metal oxide nanosheets, self-assembled at the air-water interface, is transferred onto a sensor substrate. The CuO monolayer sensors prepared with this self-assembly method show much improved gas sensitivity (sensor signal: 350% vs 100% at 5 ppm of H2S) and faster response and recovery rate (τres: 20 s vs 110 s; τrec: 120 s vs 320 s) than the thick film sensors prepared from the same sensing material. The enhanced sensing performance demonstrated by the monolayer film of CuO nanosheets is explained quantitively with a modified coupled reaction-diffusion model. Similar enhancement on gas-sensing performance is also observed for the ZnO-nanosheet-based monolayer sensors prepared by the same self-assembly method.",Ratio-Based Method To Identify True Biomarkers by Normalizing Circulating ncRNA Sequencing and Quantitative PCR Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002238,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"Recent studies have indicated that circulating noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as miRNAs are stable biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of human diseases. However, due to low concentrations of circulating ncRNAs in blood, data normalization in plasma/serum ncRNA experiments using next-generation sequencing and quantitative real time RT-qPCR is a challenge. We found that the current normalization methods based on synthetic external spiked-in controls or published endogenous miRNA controls are inappropriate as they are not stably expressed and therefore fail to reliably detect differentially expressed ncRNAs. Using the alternative of individual ncRNAs as biomarkers, we considered a ratio-based normalization method calculated taking the ratio of any two ncRNAs in the same sample and used the resulting ratios as biomarkers. We mathematically verified the method to be independent of spiked-in and internal controls, and more robust than existing reference control based normalization methods to identify differentially expressed ncRNAs as potential biomarkers for human diseases. Thus, the ratio-based method can solve the difficult normalization problem for circuiting ncRNA data to identify reliable biomarkers to meet real clinical practice.",Use of Response Surface Methodology To Develop and Optimize the Composition of a Chitosan-Polyethyleneimine-Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite Membrane Coating To More Effectively Remove Cr(VI) and Cu(II) from Water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002237,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 17,"Response surface methodology was successfully used to optimize the amounts of chitosan (CS), polyethyleneimine (PEI), graphene oxide (GO), and glutaraldehyde (GLA) to produce a multifunctional nanocomposite membrane coating able to remove positively and negatively charged heavy metals, such as Cr(VI) and Cu(II). Batch experiments with different concentrations of the four coating components (GO, CS, PEI, and GLA) on cellulose membranes were carried out with solutions containing 10 ppm Cr(VI) and Cu(II) ions. Reduced quadratic equations for the Cr(VI) and Cu(II) removal were obtained based on the observed results of the batch experiments. The numerical analysis resulted in an optimized solution of soaking for 30 min in CS, 1.95% PEI, 1000 ppm GO, and 1.68% GLA with predicted removal of 90 ± 10 and 30 ± 3% for Cr(VI) and Cu(II), respectively, with a desirability of 0.99. This mathematically optimized solution for the coating was experimentally validated. To determine the best membrane material for the coating, stability of the nanocomposite coating was determined using attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy in eight membrane materials before and after exposure to four solutions with different water chemistries. The glass microfiber (GMF) membranes were determined to be one of the best materials to receive the coating. Then, the coated GMF filter was further investigated for the removal of Cr(VI) and Cu(II) in single and binary component solutions. The results showed that the coatings were able to remove successfully both heavy metal ions, suggesting its ability to remove positively and negatively charged ions from water.",Controlling the Morphology of Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites through Dual Additive-Mediated Crystallization for Solar Cell Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002236,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 17,"To realize a high-efficiency perovskite solar cell (PSC), it is critical to optimize the morphology of the perovskite film for a uniform and smooth finish with large grain size during film formation. Using a chemical compound as an additive to the precursor solution has recently been established as a promising method to control the morphology of the perovskite film. In this study, we propose a new method to achieve an improved morphology of the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite film by simultaneous addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methoxyammonium salt (MeO) (dual additives). We demonstrated that an appropriate amount of the MeO additive helps the precursors form a stable intermediated PbI2-DMSO adduct during film formation and enlarges the perovskite grains by retarding the kinetics of conversion of the adduct to the perovskite. Furthermore, we experimentally observed that the optical band gaps and crystal structures of perovskite films are reasonably unaffected by the MeO additive because MeO is almost eliminated during annealing. By optimizing the amount of MeO, we achieved improved device performances of the PSCs with a high power conversion efficiency of 19.71% that is ∼15% higher than that obtained for the control device (17.15%).",Atomic-Scale Dynamics and Storage Performance of Na/K on FeF3 Nanosheet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002235,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 17,"Developing highly efficient FeF3-based cathode materials for Na/K-ion batteries is greatly needed, which needs long cycling life and rate performance besides large voltage and capacity. Accordingly, we designed a two-dimensional (2D) FeF3 nanosheet to obtain highly efficient Na/K-ion batteries. Moreover, first-principles calculations were implemented to discuss systematically the Na and K storage mechanism on the FeF3(012) nanosheet. The adsorption energies of Na and K are -3.55 and -3.98 eV, respectively, which can guarantee the Na/K loading process. Interestingly, Na and K adatoms on FeF3(012) prefer to get together in the form of the Na dimer and K tetramer, respectively. Energy barrier of the K tetramer is lower than that of the Na dimer (0.43 eV vs 0.45 eV). As a result, the K tetramer possesses a larger diffusion coefficient than the Na dimer (4.22 × 10-10 cm2·s-1 vs 3.32 × 10-10 cm2·s-1). That is to say, good Na/K-ion mobility can be achieved. Also, the FeF3(012) nanosheet exhibits high initial discharge voltage (4.10 V for K and 3.74 V for Na). Moreover, it has a stable discharge voltage curve in Na/K-ion batteries. Besides, the FeF3(012) nanosheet is more favorable to be fabricated as a flexible cathode material for potassium batteries. Therefore, the 2D FeF3 nanosheet belongs to a promising cathode material in Na/K-ion batteries."

Because of the high cost and scarcity of noble metals, reducing the usage is a practical way to achieve scalable applications. Herein, for the first time, three novel electrocatalysts composed of noble metal phosphide (IrP2, Pd3P, or PtP2) nanoparticles with N,P-codoped nanocarbon were synthesized by the pyrolysis of mixtures of IrCl4, PdCl2, or PtCl4 with phytic acid under an ammonia atmosphere. With an ultralow loading of Pd (1.5 μg), Pt (1.4 μg), or Ir (1.6 μg) on the electrode, the Pd3P/NPC, PtP2/NPC, and IrP2/NPC catalysts, respectively, exhibited excellent trifunctional catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, the IrP2/NPC-, Pd3P/NPC-, and PtP2/NPC-based water-splitting cells required only 1.62, 1.65, and 1.68 V, respectively, to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the IrP2/NPC-, Pd3P/NPC-, and PtP2/NPC-based zinc-air batteries exhibited higher specific capacities than that of Pt/C. IrP2/NPC exhibited a comparable performance to that of Pt/C-IrO2 for use in rechargeable zinc-air batteries.",Acoustic Bubble Suppression by Constructing a Hydrophilic Coating on HDPE Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002221,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 08,"Ultrasonic bubbles on the solid surface of various sonochemical devices largely affect signal resolution due to the serious reflection/scattering of sound waves. The Laplace pressure of the cavitation bubble can be tuned by constructing an ultrathin hydrophilic layer, which leads to the solvation or pinching off of the bubbles from the surface. In this article, we successfully coated a polydopamine polymer layer on the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) surface. The formed hydrophilic layer with a contact angle of less than 45° almost completely eliminates the bubbles in both water and 32.5 vol % diesel exhaust fluid solutions upon sonication, which results in the operation of the piezoelectric sensor over 500 h, while the sensor with pure HDPE only ran for less than 2 h. Further, the coated sensors showed high stability under the temperatures of 60-80 °C. An improved mechanical property was confirmed via abrasion test, enabling long-term stability in harsh environments, including acidic urine and ultrasonic agitation. The acoustic bubble suppression via the hydrophilic polymer coating on HDPE surface displays broad applications, particularly with acoustic sensors, sonobuoys, and nondestructive surface detection in sonochemistry.",Highly Stabilized Ni-Rich Cathode Material with Mo Induced Epitaxially Grown Nanostructured Hybrid Surface for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002220,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 08,"Capacity fading induced by unstable surface chemical properties and intrinsic structural degradation is a critical challenge for the commercial utilization of Ni-rich cathodes. Here, a highly stabilized Ni-rich cathode with enhanced rate capability and cycling life is constructed by coating the molybdenum compound on the surface of LiNi0.815Co0.15Al0.035O2 secondary particles. The infused Mo ions in the boundaries not only induce the Li2MoO4 layer in the outermost but also form an epitaxially grown outer surface region with a NiO-like phase and an enriched content of Mo6+ on the bulk phase. The Li2MoO4 layer is expected to reduce residential lithium species and promote the Li+ transfer kinetics. The transition NiO-like phase, as a pillaring layer, could maintain the integrity of the crystal structure. With the suppressed electrolyte-cathode interfacial side reactions, structure degradation, and intergranular cracking, the modified cathode with 1% Mo exhibits a superior discharge capacity of 140 mAh g-1 at 10 C, a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5 C after 250 cycles, and a high thermal stability.",Promoting Neurite Growth and Schwann Cell Migration by the Harnessing Decellularized Nerve Matrix onto Nanofibrous Guidance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002219,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 16,"Synergistic intercellular interactions have been widely acknowledged in tuning functional cell behaviors in vivo, and these interactions have inspired the development of a variety of scaffolds for regenerative medicine. In this paper, the promotion of Schwann cell (SC)-neurite interactions through the use of a nerve extracellular matrix-coated nanofiber composite in vitro was demonstrated using a cell culturing platform consisting of either random or aligned electrospun poly(l-lactic acid) nanofibers and decellularized peripheral nerve matrix gel (pDNM gel) from porcine peripheral nervous tissue. The pDNM-coated nanofiber platform served as a superior substrate for dorsal root ganglion culturing. Furthermore, SC migration was facilitated by pDNM gel coating on the nanofibers, accompanied with much faster axonal extension, in comparison with the effect of topographical guidance from the aligned electrospun fibers only. Finally, the decellularized nerve matrix promoted the ability of SCs to wrap around bundled neurites, triggering axonal remyelination toward nerve fiber functionalization.",Flexible Ferroelectret Polymer for Self-Powering Devices and Energy Storage Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002218,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 17,"Applying flexible materials for energy scavenging from ambient mechanical vibrations is a clean energy solution that can help alleviate electrical power demands in portable devices and wearable electronics. This work presents fundamental studies on a flexible ferroelectret polymer with a strong piezoelectric effect and its interface with self-powered and energy storage systems. A single-layered device with a thickness of 80 μm was used for characterizing the device's output voltage, current, transferred charge, and energy conversion efficiency. The potential capability of harvesting mechanical energy and delivering to system load is demonstrated by integrating the device into a fully integrated power management system. The theory for determining the harvested energy that is ultimately delivered to external electronic loads (or stored in a battery) is discussed. The maximum power delivery is found to be for a 600 MΩ load, which results in a device power density of 14.0 W/m3 for input mechanical forces with a frequency around 2 Hz.",TRPC channels are not required for graded persistent activity in entorhinal cortex neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002217,Hippocampus,2019 04 19,"Adaptive behavior requires the transient storage of information beyond the physical presence of external stimuli. This short-lasting form of memory involves sustained (""persistent"") neuronal firing which may be generated by cell-autonomous biophysical properties of neurons or/and neural circuit dynamics. A number of studies from brain slices reports intrinsically generated persistent firing in cortical excitatory neurons following suprathreshold depolarization by intracellular current injection. In layer V (LV) neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) persistent firing depends on the activation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors and is mediated by a calcium-activated nonselective cation current (ICAN ). The molecular identity of this conductance remains, however, unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that the underlying ion channels belong to the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel family and include heterotetramers of TRPC1/5, TRPC1/4, and/or TRPC1/4/5 channels. While this suggestion was based on pharmacological experiments and on effects of TRP-interacting peptides, an unambiguous proof based on TRPC channel-depleted animals is pending. Here, we used two different lines of TRPC channel knockout mice, either lacking TRPC1-, TRPC4-, and TRPC5-containing channels or lacking all seven members of the TRPC family. We report unchanged persistent activity in mEC LV neurons in these animals, ruling out that muscarinic-dependent persistent activity depends on TRPC channels.",Three to four years outcomes of the absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold versus second-generation drug-eluting stent: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002216,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2019 04 19,"This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the outcomes of absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) compared with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) after 3 years, the approximate time of complete polymer bioresorption.",A freshwater analog for the production of Epiphyton-like microfossils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002215,Geobiology,2019 04 19,"Calcified microbial microfossils-often interpreted as cyanobacteria-were important components of Precambrian and Paleozoic limestones, but their paucity in modern marine environments complicates our ability to make conclusive interpretations about their taxonomic affinity and geologic significance. Freshwater spring-associated limestones (e.g., travertine and tufa) serve as terrestrial analogs to investigate mineralization in and around aquatic biofilms on observable timescales. We document the diagenesis of calcite fabrics associated with the freshwater algae Oocardium stratum, an epiphytic colonial green algae (desmid) known for producing stalks of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and passively producing a bifurcating tubular calcite monocrystal. Bifurcating EPS stalks produced by Oocardium colonies can become calcified and preserved in ancient carbonate deposits. Calcified micritic EPS stalks have a filamentous morphology, show evidence of branching, and maintain uniformity in diameter thickness throughout the mm-scale colony, much like the enigmatic calcimicrobe Epiphyton. We provide a mechanism by which calcification associated with a colonial semispherical micro-organism produces microfossils that deceptively resemble filamentous forms. These findings have implications for the use of morphological traits when assigning taxonomic affinities to extinct microfossil groups and highlight the utility of calcifying freshwater modern environments to investigate microbial taphonomy.",American Head and Neck Society Endocrine Surgery Section update on parathyroid imaging for surgical candidates with primary hyperparathyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002214,Head & neck,2019 04 19,"Health care consumer organizations and insurance companies increasingly are scrutinizing value when considering reimbursement policies for medical interventions. Recently, members of several American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) committees worked closely with one insurance company to refine reimbursement policies for preoperative localization imaging in patients undergoing surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. This endeavor led to an AAO-HNS parathyroid imaging consensus statement (https://www.entnet.org/content/parathyroid-imaging). The American Head and Neck Society Endocrine Surgery Section gathered an expert panel of authors to delineate imaging options for preoperative evaluation of surgical candidates with primary hyperparathyroidism. We review herein the current literature for preoperative parathyroid localization imaging, with discussion of efficacy, cost, and overall value. We recommend that planar sestamibi imaging, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), SPECT/CT, CT neck/mediastinum with contrast, MRI, and four dimensional CT (4D-CT) may be used in conjunction with high-resolution neck ultrasound to preoperatively localize pathologic parathyroid glands.

Ovarian tissues were collected from Chinese Merino (Junken type) and Hu sheep with different reproductive states in spring and autumn. Serum samples were assayed for oestrogen (E2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations by radioimmunoassay during spring. The ovarian expression of hormone receptors (ERα, ERβ, PR, LHR and FSHR) was analysed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In Chinese Merino, there was no corpora lutea and ovulation point on the surfaces of ovaries in spring and low basal levels of both LH and P in serum. ERα, ERβ and FSHR were expressed significantly higher in Merino ovaries during anoestrus compared with oestrous or luteal phases of Hu sheep (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). However, both varieties of sheep exhibited a similar tendency to secrete E2 and FSH. Compared with Hu sheep, FSH levels were slightly higher in Merino serum. In Hu sheep, ERα, ERβ, FSHR, LHR and PR expressed in luteal phase ovaries during spring were significantly lower (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) than autumn. Interestingly, LHR and PR expressed in anoestrous ovaries were similar to that in oestrous phase of both sheep breeds. The above results suggest that seasonal reproductive sheep increased the expression of E2 and FSH receptors in ovary during spring may enhance the effects of E2 and FSH on follicular development. It is likely that this enhancement prevents the ovary from progressing to the luteal phase.",Atopic eczema: burden of disease and individual suffering - results from a large EU study in adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002197,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2019 06 07,"Atopic eczema (AE, atopic dermatitis) is one of the most common non-communicable inflammatory skin diseases affecting 1-5% of the adult population in Europe with marked impairment in quality of life.

The exact incidence and prevalence of IA are not known. The clinical manifestations of IA are similar to other known causes of anaphylaxis. A typical attack is usually acute in onset and can worsen over minutes to a few hours. The pathophysiology of IA has not yet been fully elucidated, although an IgE-mediated pathway by hitherto unidentified trigger/s might be the main underlying mechanism. Elevated concentrations of urinary histamine and its metabolite, methylimidazole acetic acid, plasma histamine and serum tryptase have been reported, consistent with mast cell activation. There is some evidence that corticosteroids reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of IA, consistent with a steroid-responsive condition. Important differential diagnoses of IA include galactose alpha-1,3 galactose (a carbohydrate contained in red meat) allergy, pigeon tick bite (Argax reflexus), wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, Anisakis simplex allergy and mast cell disorders. Other differential diagnoses include ""allergy-mimics"" such as asthma masquerading as anaphylaxis, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, panic attacks, globus hystericus, vocal cord dysfunction, scombroid poisoning, vasoactive amine intolerance, carcinoid syndrome and phaeochromocytoma. Acute treatment of IA is the same as for other forms of anaphylaxis. Long-term management is individualized and dictated by frequency and severity of symptoms and involves treatment with H1 and H2 receptor blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonist and consideration for prolonged reducing courses of oral corticosteroids. Patients should possess an epinephrine autoinjector with an anaphylaxis self-management plan. There are anecdotal reports regarding the use of omalizumab. For reasons that remain unclear, the prognosis of IA is generally favourable with appropriate treatment and patient education. If remission cannot be achieved, the diagnosis should be reconsidered.",Contrasting effects of host species and phylogenetic diversity on the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in European wild birds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002194,The Journal of animal ecology,2019 05 18,"Studies on the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 suggest that wild bird migration may facilitate its long-distance spread, yet the role of wild bird community composition in its transmission risk remains poorly understood. Furthermore, most studies on the diversity-disease relationship focused on host species diversity without considering hosts' phylogenetic relationships, which may lead to rejecting a species diversity effect when the community has host species that are only distantly related. Here, we explored the influence of waterbird community composition for determining HPAI H5N1 occurrence in wild birds in a continental-scale study across Europe. In particular, we tested the diversity-disease relationship using both host species diversity and host phylogenetic diversity. Our results provide the first demonstration that host community composition-compared with previously identified environmental risk factors-can also effectively explain the spatial pattern of H5N1 occurrence in wild birds. We further show that communities with more higher risk host species and more closely related species have a higher risk of H5N1 outbreaks. Thus, both host species diversity and community phylogenetic structure, in addition to environmental factors, jointly influence H5N1 occurrence. Our work not only extends the current theory on the diversity-disease relationship, but also has important implications for future monitoring of H5N1 and other HPAI subtypes.",Micro- and macroparasite species richness in birds: The role of host life history and ecology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002193,The Journal of animal ecology,2019 05 18,"Identifying the factors shaping variation in parasite diversity among host species is crucial to understand wildlife diseases. Although micro- and macroparasites may exert different selective pressures on their hosts, studies investigating the determinants of parasite species richness in animals have rarely considered this divide. Here, we investigated the role of host life history and ecology in explaining the species richness of helminths (macroparasites) and haemosporidians (microparasites) in birds world-wide. We collated data from multiple global datasets on diverse bird traits (longevity, body mass, coloniality, migration distance/tendency, geographic range size and dietary and habitat breadths) and the species richness of their helminth and haemosporidian parasites. We tested predictors of helminth and haemosporidian parasite richness using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. We found that, after controlling for research effort and host phylogeny, the richness of helminths, but not of haemosporidians, increased with host longevity, range size, migration distance and dietary breadth. Overall, these correlates were also important across different helminth groups (acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes and trematodes), and two additional ones (body mass, coloniality) emerged as important for cestodes and acanthocephalans. We propose that long life spans may promote the diversity of helminth parasite assemblages over evolutionary time, thus resulting in richer helminth faunas. Similarly, longer-distance migrations, larger ranges and broader dietary breadths are likely to lead to greater encounter rates and the accumulation of trophically transmitted helminths. In contrast, vector-borne haemosporidians may be influenced more by factors related to vector ecology than by the host traits included in the analyses. The lack of strong associations between haemosporidian species richness and host characteristics emphasizes the need to find appropriate traits to model the distribution and diversity of parasites with different environmental preferences in order to anticipate disease emergence risks associated with global change.",Autonomic correlates of lifetime suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adolescents with a history of depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002191,Psychophysiology,2019 04 26,"Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) have been associated with emotion dysregulation and atypical responses to affective and stressful stimuli. To investigate the psychophysiology involved, we measured changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP; indexing parasympathetic and sympathetic functioning, respectively) in response to stressful- and sadness-eliciting laboratory probes. Our sample included adolescents with a history of depression and STBs (n = 177), adolescents with a history of depression but no history of STBs (n = 47), and healthy controls (n = 175). The outcome of interest was the most severe form of clinician-rated STBs across the subject's lifetime. In partial support of our hypotheses, during the stressful task, adolescents with a history of depression and STBs did not evidence the RSA decrease that was exhibited by controls and displayed greater PEP shortening compared to ever-depressed adolescents with no lifetime STBs. No group differences were found in either RSA or PEP reactivity to the sadness-eliciting stimulus. As expected, severity of STBs was positively correlated with the extent of PEP shortening during the stressful task. The results suggest that adolescents with a history of depression and STBs experience blunted parasympathetic responses to stress along with compensatory efforts. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of STBs among youths and underscore that future studies should examine physiological risk factors for these psychopathological outcomes.",Knockout of apolipoprotein A-I decreases parenchymal and vascular β-amyloid pathology in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002190,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,2019 05 15,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the principal apolipoprotein associated with high-density lipoproteins in the periphery, is also found at high concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Although TGN1412 was designed as IgG4, known for weak Fc:Fcγ receptor (FcγR) interactions, these interactions contributed to TGN1412-induced T-cell activation. Using cell lines (TFs) expressing human FcγRI, -IIa, -IIb, or -III, we show that TGN1412 and TGN1412 as IgG1 and IgG2 are bound by FcγRs as it can be deduced from literature. However, upon coculture of TGN1412-decorated T cells with TFs or human primary blood cells, we observed that binding capacities by FcγRs do not correlate with the strength of the mediated effector function. FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb, showing no or very minor binding to TGN1412, mediated strongest T cell proliferation, while high-affinity FcγRI, exhibiting strong TGN1412 binding, mediated hardly any T-cell proliferation. These findings are of biological relevance because we show that FcγRI binds TGN1412, thus prevents binding to FcγRIIa or FcγRIIb, and consequently disables T-cell proliferation. In line with this, FcγRI- FcγRII+ but not FcγRI+ FcγRII+ monocytes mediate TGN1412-induced T-cell proliferation. Collectively, by using TGN1412 as example, our results indicate that binding of monomeric IgG subclasses does not predict the FcγR-mediated effector function, which has major implications for the design of therapeutic mAbs.",PET imaging during hypoglycaemia to study adipose tissue metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002171,European journal of clinical investigation,2019 04 29,"Disturbances in adipose tissue glucose uptake may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, yet its examination by 2-deoxy-2-[18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18 F]FDG) PET/CT is challenged by relatively low uptake kinetics.

PPQ included pellet durability index (PDI), pellet hardness, and pellet length of broiler diets processed under short-term conditioning. The first experiment had 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial with 2 types (SO and CFP) and 2 levels (1.5 and 3%) of mixer-added fat. In the second experiment, 22 treatments, combinations of 2 types of mixer-added fat (SO and CFP) at 3 levels (0, 1.5 and 3%) and 2 types of PB (CaLS = 0, 0.5, and 1% and Ben = 0, 1, and 2%), were arranged by a completely randomized design. PDI was measured by 2 devices: Pfost Tumbling box (PDIT) and Holmen NHP tester (PDIH). The results showed that the diets containing 1.5% CFP without PB had significant differences in all PPQ parameters. The results revealed that adding 0.5% CaLS to the 3% SO diets significantly enhanced PDIH, pellet hardness, and pellet length compared to other treatments. Moreover, 1.5% CFP diets with 2% Ben had significantly higher PDIT, PDIH, and pellet hardness among the treatments. Based on contour plots, different levels of Ben in the diets containing SO failed to create optimum PDIT values (>96%). However, 1.5 to 2.50% CFP diets without Ben had the optimum PDIT values. The optimum PDIT value was achieved by the diets containing 3% SO in the range of 0.21 to 0.56% CaLS. Furthermore, adding 0.5% CaLS to the diets containing less than 2.86% SO resulted in suboptimal PDIT values (<96%). The diets containing 1.5 to 2.50% CFP without CaLS had the optimum PDIT values. However, increasing CaLS levels more than 0.38% led to suboptimal PDIT values. Overall, these results indicated that the selection of appropriate PBs should be based on type and level of mixer-added fat.",Effects of the routine multiple vaccinations on the expression of innate immune molecules and induction of histone modification in ovarian cells of layer chicks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002109,Poultry science,2019 04 19,"The aim of this study was to determine whether vaccination affects the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokines, and avian β-defensins (AvBDs) in the chick ovary with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. White Leghorn female chicks were administered vaccines for infectious bronchitis, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, and infectious bursal disease during the first 14 D after hatching and ovarian tissues were collected on day 21. Control chicks received water or dilution buffer in place of vaccine. In Experiment 1, ovarian tissues were incubated with or without LPS, and the expression of innate immune molecules (TLRs, cytokines, and AvBDs) was examined by real-time PCR. In Experiment 2, the levels of histone modification in fresh ovarian tissues were examined by western blot analysis. The results of Experiment 1 showed that, in vaccinated chick ovaries, the expression of TLR1-1, 2-1, 2-2, and 21 was up-regulated, whereas that of TLR1-2, 4, and 7 was down-regulated under LPS stimulation. Among the examined 6 cytokines, only the expression of TNFSF15 was lower in the ovaries of vaccinated chicks than that in control with or without LPS stimulation. The expression of AvBD1, 2, 4, and 7 was lower in the ovaries of vaccinated chicks than in control without LPS stimulation, and that of AvBD1 and 2 was also lower even in ovaries incubated with LPS. In Experiment 2, the density of di-methyl histone H3 (Lys9) and acetyl histone H3 (Lys9) was significantly higher in the vaccine group than in the control, whereas di-methyl and tri-methyl histone H3 (Lys4) and acetyl histone H3 (Lys27) did not show differences between the groups. These results suggest that vaccination positively or negatively affects the expression of innate immune molecules in the chick ovary including TLRs, TNFSF15, and AvBDs, and it may be associated with epigenetic reprogramming by histone modifications in ovarian cells. Thus, in the future, it may be possible to develop or improve vaccination programs for the enhancement of the innate immune system in the hen ovary.",Spectral technique for detection of changes in eggshells caused by Mycoplasma synoviae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002107,Poultry science,2019 04 19,"Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a major pathogen in chicken and turkeys, causing subclinical infection. MS infections are highly prevalent and may potentate and be involved in sinovitis, respiratory syndromes, as well as lead to eggshell apex abnormality (EAA). A deformed, inhomogeneous eggshell is susceptible to cracks and breaks through which microbes get in and additionally entails higher water loss in the egg during the entire incubation process. Not all eggs with eggshell apex abnormality possess characteristic deformation and that is why some eggs may be incorrectly classified during a visual inspection. To minimize the above risk, the spectral VIS technique and the analysis based on the classification tree method-CTM is proposed. The method makes use of specially defined parameters extracted from the shape of transmittance spectra of eggshells. Directional coefficients of the lines adjusted to the specific ranges of the transmittance spectrum are used in the process of classifying samples as those from MS-carrying hens and from healthy hens. Three CTM-based classifiers were created for a group of white, brown, and mixed shells. After comparing, it can be concluded that the best results were obtained for the group of brown shells (accuracy 88%, specificity 88%, and false negative rate 13%). The authors present a non-invasive spectral method that utilizes eggshells, i.e., the natural waste from chicken farms. The method enables entering data into the classifiers described in the article. The process provides an opportunity to correctly assign, the examined shell to the group of shells with increased risk-with approx. 86% accuracy. This means that, if a few of such results are registered, the herd is eligible more specific studies targeting MS bacteria. Regular spectral testing can support the detection of egg lesions in MS positive flocks.",McbR is involved in biofilm formation and H2O2 stress response in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli X40.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002106,Poultry science,2019 04 19,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes a variety of extraintestinal diseases known as colibacillosis and is responsible for significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. Biofilm formation results in increased morbidity and persistent infections, and is the main reason for the difficult treatment of colibacillosis with antimicrobial agents. It is reported that the transcriptional regulator McbR regulates biofilm formation and mucoidy by repressing the expression of the periplasmic protein YbiM, and activates the transcription of the yciGFE operon by binding to the yciG promoter in E. coli K-12. However, whether McbR regulates biofilm formation and H2O2 stress response in APEC has been not reported. The present study showed that, in the clinical isolate APECX40, the deletion of mcbR increased biofilm formation by upregulating the transcription of the biofilm-associated genes bcsA, fliC, wcaF, and fimA. In addition, the deletion of mcbR decreased H2O2 stress response by downregulating the transcript levels of the stress-associated genes yciF and yciE. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that McbR directly binds to the promoter regions of yciG and yciF. This study may provide new clues to understanding gene regulation in APEC.","Cyclosporiasis Surveillance - United States, 2011-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002104,"Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Models of care, initially accessed from the clinical point of view, must also be evaluated in terms of their economic effectiveness, as health care systems are limited. The Integrated Care Model (ICM) is a procedure dedicated to patients suffering from advanced COPD that offers home-oriented support from a multidisciplinary team. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ICM. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 44 patients in the study (31 males, 13 females) with an average age 72 years (Me=71). Costs of care were estimated based on data received from public payer records and included general costs, COPD-related costs, and exacerbation-related costs. To evaluate cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was used. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on changes in health care resources utilization and the value of costs observed in 2 consecutive 6-month periods before and after introducing ICM. RESULTS Costs of care of all types decreased after introducing ICM. Demand for ambulatory visits changed significantly (p=0.037) together with a substantial decrease in the number of emergency department appointments and hospitalizations (p=0.033). ICER was more profitable for integrated care than for standard care when assessing costs of avoiding negative parameters such as hospitalizations (-227 EUR), exacerbations-related hospitalizations (-312 EUR), or emergency procedures (-119 EUR). CONCLUSIONS ICM is a procedure that meets the criteria of cost-effectiveness. It allows for avoiding negative parameters such as unplanned hospitalizations with higher economic effectiveness than the standard type of care used in managing COPD.",Differential Regulation of Gonadotropins in Response to Continuous Infusion of Native Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone in the Winter Anovulatory Mare and Effects of Treatment With Estradiol-17β.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002102,Journal of equine veterinary science,2019 04 19,"We tested the hypotheses that in winter anovulatory mares (1) both chronic daily injections of estradiol-17β (E2) and subcutaneous E2 implants could enhance pituitary secretion of gonadotropins in response to continuous subcutaneous infusion of native gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH); and (2) the secretory pattern of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in response to continuous subcutaneous infusion of native GnRH is similar to that of luteinizing hormone (LH) but differs between mares that develop or fail to develop an estrogen-active, preovulatory follicle. In Experiment 1, 20 winter anovulatory mares (n = 5 per group) in early February received twice-daily injections of corn oil (control) or 5 mg of E2 with or without continuous subcutaneous treatment with native GnRH (100 μg/hr) or received GnRH only for up to 14 days. In Experiment 2, 24 winter anovulatory mares (n = 6 per group) were treated with a full-length (high dose) or quarter-length (low dose) E2 implant (Compudose) in combination with continuous GnRH infusion (100 μg/hr) for up to 28 days or served as sham controls. Mares developing 35-mm follicles were induced to ovulate with human chorionic gonadotropin. Mares not developing a 35-mm follicle within 14 days received a replacement 14-day GnRH pump. In Experiment 1, E2 enhanced the response to GnRH beginning on Day 3, with mean LH greater (P < .001) in GnRH + E2 than in GnRH only and control mares. In Experiment 2, plasma E2 and estrone sulfate were increased in association with the development of a large (35 mm) follicle but did not increase in response to either E2 implant despite marked increases in uterine edema following their insertion. A sustained increase (P < .0001) in plasma LH was observed in all GnRH-treated mares, but this effect was not modified by implant treatment. By Day 28, six of six GnRH, five of six GnRH + low E2, two of six GnRH + high E2, and zero of six control mares developed 35-mm follicles and were induced to ovulate. A marked increase (P < .0001) in plasma FSH was observed within 24 hours in all GnRH-treated mares, returning to baseline by Day 4. In summary, twice-daily injection of 5 mg E2 enhanced pituitary secretion of LH in response to continuous administration of GnRH, but commercial E2 cattle implants failed to duplicate these effects. Continuous infusion of GnRH produced a differential but consistent pattern of FSH secretion (short-term increase) compared with LH (sustained increase). Differences in ovarian responses to GnRH treatment could not be explained by variation in gonadotropin secretion.",An Objective Assessment of the Effect of Anesthetizing the Median Nerve on Lameness Caused by Pain in the Cubital Joint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002100,Journal of equine veterinary science,2019 04 19,"The median nerve, along with the ulnar nerve, is often anesthetized when performing a lameness examination in horses. Because of the close proximity of the median nerve to the cubital joint, proximal migration of local anesthetic might ameliorate pain originating from the cubital joint. The objective of this study was to determine if a median nerve block will ameliorate lameness caused by pain in the cubital joint. A forelimb lameness was induced in six healthy horses by injecting 100 ng of recombinant equine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) into the cubital joint. The median nerve of the lame leg was anesthetized using 10 mL of 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride. A successful median nerve block was confirmed by loss of skin sensation at the medial aspect of the pastern and typical changes in thermographic images. Gait was assessed before and at 20, 40, and 60 minutes after the median nerve block using an inertial sensor-based motion analysis system (Lameness Locator; Equinosis LLC, Columbia, MO). A full-factorial repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare treatment effect across time. IL-1β administration resulted in significant transient lameness in all horses (P < .0001). The median nerve block was successfully performed in all horses and did not result in significant improvement (P = .32) of lameness as quantified by the total differential head vector sum. This result has relevant clinical application as it suggests when performing a lameness examination, it is unlikely that blocking the median nerve with 10 mL of local anesthetic will ameliorate pain originating from the cubital joint.","Perfect Riders: Personality, Perfectionism, and Mental Health in Norwegian Competition Riders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002099,Journal of equine veterinary science,2019 04 19,"The purpose of the study was to elucidate the relationship between personality traits, perfectionism, and mental health (self-efficacy, positive emotions) among competition riders. Data were collected by online questionnaires among 662 licensed competition riders in Norway. The results showed that riders who were high on conscientiousness and low on neuroticism had better mental health than other riders. Self-oriented perfectionism predicted mental health and mediated partly the associations between personality traits and mental health. Socially prescribed perfectionism had no association with mental health. The findings indicate that self-oriented perfectionism may have a positive effect on the mental health of the riders. The high degree of conscientiousness that many of the competition riders possess may be associated with self-oriented perfectionism and positive outcomes.",The Effect of Different Flushing Media Used to Aspirate Follicles on the Outcome of a Commercial Ovum Pickup-ICSI Program in Mares.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002097,Journal of equine veterinary science,2019 04 19,"The in vitro production of embryos by ovum pickup (OPU) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is gaining popularity among horse breeders and veterinarians. Various collection media are available for flushing follicles during OPU. The objective of this study was to determine whether the type of flushing media used to aspirate follicles and collect oocytes influences the outcome of a commercial equine OPU-ICSI program. Two commercial embryo flushing media (EFM1 and EFM2) supplemented with heparin were compared with a flushing media designed specifically for the collection of oocytes (oocyte flushing media [OFM]) on the outcome of OPU-ICSI parameters in 234 Warmblood mares. The OPU-ICSI performed in mares using one of the EFM1 resulted in a lower (P < .05) blastocyst rate and blastocysts per OPU-ICSI session (11.9 ± 13.2%, 0.88 ± 1.3) than the OFM (19.2 ± 15.2%, 1.24 ± 1.2). Unlike the EFM2 solution, the heparin used to prepare the EFM1 contained preservatives including benzyl alcohol, a component known to alter the oocyte membrane, which might have been responsible for the lower developmental competence of oocytes collected with EFM1. In conclusion, exposure of oocytes (<1.5 hours) to one of the flushing medium tested in this study affected negatively the outcome of the OPU-ICSI commercial program when compared with flushing media designed for collection of equine oocytes. Care should be taken when choosing the components of the flushing media used to collect oocytes. Further research should be carried out to confirm the potential negative effect of the preservatives used in multidose heparin vials."

The present study analyzed the interobserver reliability of the Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) welfare assessment protocol for horses to further enhance knowledge concerning reliability. Therefore, two trained observers conducted 18 assessments on farm at the same time and on the same animals. The results were compared at individual level by calculation of Cohen's kappa (κ), weighted kappa (κw), and prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). Spearman rank correlation coefficient (RS), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), limits of agreement (LoA), and smallest detectable change (SDC) were used at farm level. The Qualitative Behaviour Assessment was further analyzed by means of principal component analysis. At the individual level, most of the indicators demonstrated acceptable (κ, κw, PABAK ≥ 0.4) to good (κ, κw, PABAK ≥ 0.6) interobserver reliability. Also, at farm level, most of the indicators demonstrated acceptable (RS ≥ 0.4; ICC ≥ 0.4; SDC: ≤ 0.1; LoA ε [0.1; 0.1]) to good (RS: ≥ 0.7; ICC: ≥ 0.7; SDC: ≤ 0.05; LoA: ε [0.05; 0.05]) interobserver reliability. Exceptions were the indicators moderate presence of tension above eye area (score 1) and orbital tightening (score 1) on the Horse Grimace Scale, as well as the presence of swollen joints. Furthermore, the present results indicate that the details for the different scores should be improved for some indicators such as the Body Condition Score. In general, this study points out a good interobserver reliability of the AWIN welfare assessment protocol for horses.",Are Respiratory Clinical Signs in Horses Associated With Strongyle Egg Shedding Rates on Farms With Varying Egg Shedding Levels?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002083,Journal of equine veterinary science,2019 04 19,"Respiratory signs or more specifically severe equine asthma (SEA) is in some studies reported to be associated with decreased strongyle egg shedding. This association can be reproduced in a larger population of unrelated horses. The owners of 209 horses, on seven farms in Bavaria, were interviewed using, an in prior studies validated questionnaire. Horses were categorized into classes of the horse owner assessed respiratory signs index (HOARSI 1-4, unaffected to severely affected). In total, 1,035 fecal samples were analyzed between March 2011 and September 2014 using a modified McMaster procedure resulting in fecal egg counts (FECs). The HOARSI categories were categorized into two groups in two ways: HOARSI 1 versus HOARSI 2, 3, 4 in model A and HOARSI 1 versus HOARSI 3 and 4 in model B, and further variables known to influence strongyle egg shedding, such as age and seasonality, time on pasture, and pasture hygiene were included in a generalized additive mixed model. The mean FECs (35-320 eggs per gram feces) was different between the farms. In the model, the effect of the presence or absence of respiratory signs on the FECs varied in its direction between the farms and was not significant. The effect of the horse itself, the age of the horse, and seasonality was significant (P < .05). These results are in contrast to some prior studies. Future studies should investigate if these differences are caused by genetic effects only present in some respiratory clinical signs and or SEA-affected horses.",Eye Surface Temperature as a Potential Indicator of Physical Fitness in Ranch Horses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002082,Journal of equine veterinary science,2019 04 19,"This study aimed to investigate the use of maximum eye surface temperature (ESTmax), recorded by infrared thermography, as an indicator of physical fitness in ranch horses. Data collection was carried out with 16 horses by recording six physical fitness biomarkers (ESTmax, respiratory rate, creatine kinase activity [CK], and concentrations of total serum protein, plasmatic cortisol, and lactate) before and after a regular working day. We also recorded heart rate during the exercise, exercise duration, average velocity, distance traveled, and air temperature and humidity. The variation between the sampling times was compared by using repeated measures ANOVA or Wilcoxon paired test. The t-test was used to compare ESTmax means of dehydrated and nondehydrated horses. The differences (DIF-) between each variable's sampling times were calculated, and the Spearman's correlation coefficients between DIF-ESTmax and DIF- of other variables were estimated. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify the horses according to their physical fitness. All biomarkers increased after the workday, and the ESTmax means of dehydrated and nondehydrated horses did not differ (P < .05). DIF-CK and DIF-ESTmax were positively correlated (rs = 0.56, P < .05). The cluster analysis defined two groups of horses (LOW and HIGH), with DIF-ESTmax and DIF-CK differing statistically between them. HIGH horses showed CK higher than 350 U/L, indicating some degree of muscle damage. These results suggest that ESTmax has potential to predict changes in CK and, thus could be a useful indicator of physical fitness in ranch horses; although, its effectiveness has to be confirmed in future studies.",Novel Method for Rapid Detection of Spatiotemporal HIV Clusters Potentially Warranting Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002076,Emerging infectious diseases,2019 05 08,Rapid detection of increases in HIV transmission enables targeted outbreak response efforts to reduce the number of new infections.

To guide control measures, we analyzed the characteristics of cholera epidemiology in DRC on the basis of surveillance and cholera treatment center data for 2008-2017. The 2017 nationwide outbreak resulted from 3 distinct mechanisms: considerable increases in the number of cases in cholera-endemic areas, so-called hot spots, around the Great Lakes in eastern DRC; recurrent outbreaks progressing downstream along the Congo River; and spread along Congo River branches to areas that had been cholera-free for more than a decade. Case-fatality rates were higher in nonendemic areas and in the early phases of the outbreaks, possibly reflecting low levels of immunity and less appropriate prevention and treatment. Targeted use of oral cholera vaccine, soon after initial cases are diagnosed, could contribute to lower case-fatality rates.",Fatal Meningitis in Patient with X-Linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease Caused by Virulent Granulibacter bethesdensis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002074,Emerging infectious diseases,2019 05 08,Granulibacter bethesdensis is a pathogen reported to cause recurrent lymphadenitis exclusively in persons with chronic granulomatous disease.

By conducting pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, we found that a novel sequence type (ST), newly registered as ST1420, was the dominant ST isolated from the cases of nosocomial infections that occurred in 3 locations in Japan in 2006, 2013, and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ST1420 strains belonged to the Cereus III lineage, which is much closer to the Anthracis lineage than to other Cereus lineages.

We identified 9 cases by case finding, chart review, interviews, surgical observations, matched case-control study, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of isolates, and environmental investigation; 6 cases were diagnosed >90 days after surgery. Cases were associated with a surgical instrument vendor representative being in the operating room during surgery; other potential sources were ruled out. A tenth case occurred during 2016. This cluster of infections associated with a vendor reinforces that all personnel entering the operating suite should follow infection control guidelines; samples for mycobacterial culture should be collected early; and postoperative surveillance for <90 days can miss surgical site infections caused by slow-growing organisms requiring specialized cultures, like mycobacteria.","Lassa and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses, Mali.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002054,Emerging infectious diseases,2019 05 08,"We report detection of Lassa virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infections in the area of Bamako, the capital of Mali.

This filtration process maintains a constant pressure drop during particles loading, which makes it an interesting alternative for aerosol filtration. In order to establish mathematical models for the design of the process, a modelling approach that takes into account the changes of the bed characteristics due to the liquid hold up is undertaken. This approach allows predicting the pressure drop and the filtration efficiency of the trickle granular bed, based on the assumption that the bed porosity decreases and the collectors diameter increases with increasing the liquid flow rate. The model predictions are in agreement with experimental data. For particles with diameters around 100 nm the collection efficiency presents a minimum. For smaller particles the collection efficiency increases as the dominating collection mechanism is Brownian diffusion. In the micronic range the collection is governed by inertial and interception mechanisms and consequently increases with increasing the particle size.","Religious and spiritual struggles, religiousness, and alcohol problems among undergraduates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002030,Journal of prevention & intervention in the community,2019 06 11,"Theoretically, religion/spirituality may protect against alcohol problems or facilitate recovery. However, challenges can arise in religious/spiritual life that may contribute to or complicate alcohol problems. Emerging adults often experience difficult transitions from family environments to independent membership in academic communities straddling the legal drinking age boundary. Among underage undergraduates, we hypothesized that religious/spiritual struggles predict more alcohol problems independently of distress and religiousness, and religiousness independently predicts fewer alcohol problems. Our survey of two U.S. universities (total N = 2525) supported these hypotheses. Structural equation models revealed positive correlations between alcohol problems and all six religious/spiritual struggles (divine, demonic, interpersonal, moral, ultimate meaning, doubt), but only moral struggle predicted alcohol problems moderately and independently of religiousness, distress, gender, and non/white ethnicity. Evidence also emerged for negative correlations between religious/spiritual struggles and drinking as it varies independently of alcohol problems. We recommend that alcoholism counselors address clients' religious/spiritual struggles.",Dynamic expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 in the mouse spinal cord dorsal horn under pathological pain states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002029,Neurological research,2019 06 15,"Objective: Animal models of chronic pain have demonstrated that glial cells are promising target for development of analgesic drugs. However, preclinical studies on glial response under chronic pain conditions vary depending on the cellular markers, the species used, the experimental design and model. Therefore, we investigate the expression profile of GFAP and Iba-1 during the behavioral manifestation of sensory disorder in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Methods: the expression profile of fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) were quantitated in the spinal dorsal horn of Balb/C mice submitted to six models of chronic pain. Protein analysis was performed by western blot and the results colligated with pain-related behavior. Results: Using the same method to quantitate proteins we observed that while GFAP is upregulated after axotomy, partial nerve injury and cutaneous inflammation, its expression is not changed during muscle inflammation, non-inflammatory muscle pain, and in a viral-associated pain. Differently, Iba-1 is downregulated after axotomy but upregulated after partial lesion of peripheral nerve as well as after virus inoculation and during non-inflammatory muscle pain. Cutaneous and muscle inflammation induced no change in Iba-1 expression in the dorsal horn.In spite of a marked time-dependent variation in protein expression, mechanical allodynia was present at any time of all the models investigated. Discussion: Under distinct pain conditions, GFAP and Iba-1 expression is dependent on the origin of the stimulus, disease progression and tissue affected.

The electronic and structural properties, adsorption energy and frontier molecular orbitals of various configurations are examined. Our theoretical results indicated that the interaction of the nanotubes with penicillamine molecule is weak so that the drug adsorption process is typically physisorption. Also, results of theoretical calculations show that the adsorption of the drug molecule on f-SWCNT is stronger with shorter intermolecular distances in comparison to pure SWCNT. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of studied systems demonstrates that the charge is transferred from penicillamine molecule to the nanotubes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to evaluate the dynamic and diffusion behavior of drug molecule on SWCNT and f-SWCNT. Energy results show that drug molecule spontaneously moves toward the carriers, and the van der Waals energy contributions in drug adsorption are more than electrostatic interaction. The obtained results from MD simulation confirm that the functionalization of SWCNT leads to increase in the solubility of the carrier in aqueous solution. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Studies focused on religion and spirituality as a coping mechanism find significant positive effects on the lives of older adults. This study investigated how an older person's living situation influences his or her access to spiritual and religious resources and, consequently, his or her health. Utilizing existing data, this pilot project examined the relationship between visits from a chaplain and the mood, pain level, functional ability, and/or discharge status of elders residing in the rehabilitation unit of one long-term care facility. Samples of patients who did and did not have chaplaincy visits were matched based on their level of frailty.

Despite the considerable diversity of teams and their operation, researchers tend to aim for unified theories and models regardless of field. However, we argue that there is a need for translation and adaptation of the theoretical models to each specific domain. To this end, a case study was carried out on fighter pilots and it was investigated how teamwork is performed in this specialised and challenging environment, with a specific focus on the dependence on technology for these teams. The collaboration between the fighter pilots is described and analysed using a generic theoretical model for effective teamwork from the literature. The results show that domain-specific application and modification is needed in order for the model to capture fighter pilot's teamwork. The study provides deeper understanding of the working conditions for teams of pilots and gives design implications for how tactical support systems can enhance teamwork in the domain. Practitioner summary: This article presents a qualitative interview study with fighter pilots based on a generic theoretical teamwork model applied to the fighter domain. The purpose is to understand the conditions under which teams of fighter pilots work and to provide guidance for the design of future technological aids.",Application of relational tool to support acute cardiac patients' emotional recovery: analysis of effects during acute and follow-up care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002025,International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,2019 05 10,"After an acute cardiac event, many patients experience emotional disturbance.

The data are the result of semi-structured narrative interviews, conducted in the intensive cardio care unit of the Mauriziano hospital of Turin and by telephone, during March and August of 2017. The research sample involved 26 patients, divided into control and intervention groups. Exclusion criteria were: under age of 18, cognitive impairment or dementia, difficulty with comprehension and expression in Italian, and previous acute cardiac events. The interviews have shown that an emotional management tool improves the patient's recovery, the quality of information received, and the quality of the patient's everyday life after the event.

Yet, the functional implication of the UPP in tissue homeodynamics at the whole organism level and its potential cross-talk with other proteostatic or mitostatic modules are not well understood. We show here that knock down (KD) of proteasome subunits in Drosophila flies, induced, for most subunits, developmental lethality. Ubiquitous or tissue specific proteasome dysfunction triggered systemic proteome instability and activation of PN modules, including macroautophagy/autophagy, molecular chaperones and the antioxidant cncC (the fly ortholog of NFE2L2/Nrf2) pathway. Also, proteasome KD increased genomic instability, altered metabolic pathways and severely disrupted mitochondrial functionality, triggering a cncC-dependent upregulation of mitostatic genes and enhanced rates of mitophagy. Whereas, overexpression of key regulators of antioxidant responses (e.g., cncC or foxo) could not suppress the deleterious effects of proteasome dysfunction; these were alleviated in both larvae and adult flies by modulating mitochondrial dynamics towards increased fusion or by enhancing autophagy. Our findings reveal the extensive functional wiring of genomic, proteostatic and mitostatic modules in higher metazoans. Also, they support the notion that age-related increase of proteotoxic stress due to decreased UPP activity deregulates all aspects of cellular functionality being thus a driving force for most age-related diseases.

Unfortunately, many tumors will acquire resistance and >75% of NSCLC cases lack for an actionable gene aberration. In this setting, immunotherapy rises as effective therapeutic where immune checkpoint inhibitors have entered or are entering the market in many neoplasms, including NSCLC. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4, promoting T-cell activation and its subsequent anti-tumoral immune effect. Ipilimumab might have a very important role in NSCLC as it does in melanoma because of its synergistic effect with PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors.

We analyzed data iteratively coding transcripts using an immersion/crystallization approach to identify themes. Findings: We achieved saturation after 9 interviews with 11 participants. We identified 3 major themes: (a) Residency programs rely on an existing primary-care-based literacy promotion intervention (Reach Out and Read) and the resident continuity clinic for literacy promotion training; (b) program directors encourage early and repeated exposure to facilitate literacy promotion education; and (c) service obligations, content specifications, and pressure on faculty create competing time demands that function as key barriers to literacy promotion training.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that arginine, glutamine, or glycine supplementation ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury in mice. Mice pretreated with aerosolized arginine, glutamine, or glycine were exposed to aerosolized LPS to induce lung injury. Results showed that arginine or glycine pretreatment beneficially reduced LPS-induced collagen deposition, apoptosis of alveolar cells, expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissues of mice, thus contributing to improved alveolar integrity and function. Glutamine administration reduced LPS-induced collagen deposition and inflammatory cytokines without affecting any other parameters examined in the study. Our findings indicated that arginine or glycine pretreatment effectively alleviated LPS-induced lung injury by inhibiting the accumulation of lymphocytes, the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the apoptosis of alveolar cells.

B,2019 05 02,"Enthalpies of solution, Δsln H, of six C-alkylresorcin[4]arene ( C-ARA) solids, with alkyl substituents varying systematically from methyl (Me) to hexyl (Hx), have been measured in water, using solubility data, and in acetonitrile, by direct calorimetry. For all of the C-ARAs studied, the values of Δsln H were highly favorable (exothermic) for dissolution into water but were strongly unfavorable (endothermic) for dissolution into acetonitrile (ACN). The differences between the two solvents varied systematically with increasing carbon chain length, from about 100 kJ·mol-1 (for Me) to 140 kJ·mol-1 (for Hx). These extraordinary variances can be attributed to the loss of hydrophilic hydration of the eight -OH groups on the rim of the C-ARAs and also by the loss of (enthalpically favorable) hydrophobic hydration of the alkyl chains upon transfer from the highly structured, strongly H-bonding water to the aprotic, relatively weak donor/acceptor ACN. Although Δsln H values for the present C-ARAs in H2O are strongly favorable, they are more than counteracted by even larger negative changes in the entropy of dissolution, Δsln S. This enthalpy/entropy compensation effect is consistent with the low aqueous solubilities (<10-3 mol·kg-1) of the C-ARAs and their slight increase with increasing carbon chain length, which is opposite to typical behavior of the homologous series of organic molecules.",Sesquiterpenes from an Eastern African Medicinal Mushroom Belonging to the Genus Sanghuangporus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001977,Journal of natural products,2019 05 24,"During the course of searching for new anti-infective and other biologically active secondary metabolites from Kenyan basidiomycetes, 13 previously undescribed metabolites, (6 R,7 S,10 R)-7,10-epoxy-7,11-dimethyldodec-1-ene-6,11-diol (1) and 12 sesquiterpenes named elgonenes A-L (2-13), and the known compound P-coumaric acid (14) were isolated from a basidiomycete collected in Mount Elgon Natural Reserve.

MTT assays were used to detect the effect of overexpression or knockdown of STAT3 or fractalkine on the proliferation rate of vascular endothelial cells. Scratch assays were used to detect the effect of overexpression or knockdown of STAT3 or fractalkine on vascular endothelial cell migration. There results showed that overexpression of STAT3 could promote fractalkine expression, and knockdown of STAT3 could down-regulate fractalkine expression. STAT3 could directly bind to the promoter of fractalkine to promote its transcriptional activity via binding the GAS site of the fractalkine promoter. Knockdown of STAT3 could inhibit the migration of vascular endothelial cell, and overexpression of fractalkine antagonized this inhibition. Our data concluded that STAT3 promotes the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cell by binding the GAS site of the fractalkine promoter to promote fractalkine transcriptional activity and expression.",[Production of antioxidative exopolysaccharides of Cordyceps militaris with Vernonia amygdalina leaves in substrate].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001952,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,2019 04 19,"Cordyceps militaris exopolysaccharides (EPS) have many pharmacological activities such as boosting immunity and antifatigue. To obtain EPS efficiently, we added moderate Vernonia amygdalina leaf powder as inducer to the fermentation medium to promote the production of Cordyceps militaris EPS and studied the infrared absorption spectrum and antioxidant activities of the EPS after optimization. The optimum liquid fermentation conditions were as follows: addition of Vernonia amygdalina leaf powder of 8 g/L, fermentation duration of 9 d, initial pH of 6.5, inoculation quantity of 5.0 mL. Under such a condition, the yield of Cordyceps militaris EPS reached (5.24±0.28) mg/mL, increased by 205.20% compared to the control group without adding Vernonia amygdalina leaf powder. Results of infrared analysis and antioxidant activity showed that the Vernonia amygdalina leaves had little effect on the structure and activities of Cordyceps militaris EPS. The results of this research suggest that Vernonia amygdalina leaf can enhance the production of Cordyceps militaris EPS effectively, and provides a novel method for efficient production of EPS in Cordyceps militaris.","[Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of gibberellin biosynthesis, metabolism and signaling family genes in Phyllostachys edulis].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001951,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,2019 04 19,"Gibberellin is an essential plant hormone that plays an important regulatory role throughout the life cycle of higher plants. A total of 23 genes involved in gibberellin action were identified from Phyllostachys edulis genome, including 8 GA20ox and 1 GA3ox genes involved in the gibberellin biosynthesis, 8 GA2ox genes involved in the metabolism of gibberellin, 2 GID1 genes involved in gibberellin perception, 2 GID2 genes and 2 DELLA genes involved in gibberellin signal transduction. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes from Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa and Phyllostachys edulis revealed that gibberellin biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling pathways are conserved in these species. Treatment of seeds and seedlings of bamboo with exogenous gibberellin revealed that gibberellin significantly increased seed germination rate and stem elongation of seedlings, and had the best concentration of action. The expression levels of GA20ox and GA3ox genes in the bamboo seedlings were down-regulated and the expression of the active gibberellin-degrading gene GA2ox was up-regulated after GA3 treatment, and the transcriptional level of the gibberellin receptor GID1 and the positive regulatory gene GID2 was significantly increased while the expression of the negative regulatory gene DELLA was decreased. These genes have significant differences in the expression of different spatial locations of bamboo shoot stems, GA20ox, GA3ox, GA2ox, GID1 and GID2 are all expressed in the upper part of bamboo shoots, while the repressor gene DELLA accumulates at the bottom of the shoots and is hardly expressed at the top.",[Increasing the thermostability of glutamate decarboxylase from Lactobacillus brevis by introducing proline].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001950,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,2019 04 19,"Glutamate decarboxylase, a unique pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, catalyzes α-decarboxylation of L-glutamate to γ-aminobutyrate. However, glutamate decarboxylase from different sources has the common problem of poor thermostability that affects its application in industry. In this study, proline was introduced at 13 different positions in glutamate decarboxylase by using the design strategy of homologous sequence alignment between Thermococcus kodakarensis and Lactobacillus brevis CGMCC No.1306. A mutant enzyme G364P with higher thermostability was obtained. Compared to the wild type, thermostability of the mutant G364P was significantly improved, the half-life time (t1/2) at 55 °C and the semi-inactivation temperature (T₅₀ ¹⁵) of the mutant G364P increased 19.4 min and 5.3 °C, respectively, while kcat/Km of the mutant enzyme remained nearly unchanged. Further analysis of their thermostability by molecular dynamics simulations were performed. The root mean square deviation of G364P and root mean square fluctuation in the loop region including G364 were lower than the wild type at 313 K for 10 ns, and G364P increased one hydrophobic interaction in the loop region. It proves that mutation of flexible 364-Gly to rigid proline endows glutamate decarboxylase with enhanced thermostability."

However, the clinical implication and function of YWHAE in breast cancer remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of the YWHAE in human breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze YWHAE expression in breast cancer tissues. Cell model was applied to examine the functions of YWHAE. The chemotherapeutic agents were used to evaluate the effect of YWHAE in breast cancer cell lines. YWHAE expression was associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and poor patient survival in patients with breast cancer. YWHAE overexpression significantly increased the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells. Knockdown of YWHAE expression reduced the expression of Snail and Twist in breast cancer cells. We also found that YWHAE was responsible for the resistance of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, and knockdown of YWHAE enhanced sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our findings indicated that YWHAE promoted cancer progression and chemoresistance in breast cancer cells and can be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.",Hepcidin is not essential for mediating testosterone's effects on erythropoiesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001931,Andrology,2019 04 19,"We have shown that testosterone administration suppresses hepcidin, stimulates iron-dependent erythropoiesis, and increases hemoglobin and hematocrit.",Epigenetic regulation of regulatory T cells in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001930,FEBS open bio,2019 06 11,"Abdominal arterial aneurysm (AAA) shares many features with autoimmune diseases and appears to be a T-cell-mediated process.

We used flow cytometry to sort FOXP3+ CD4+ CD25+ Tregs from the peripheral blood of AAA patients and from healthy controls (HC), and then detected DNA methylation and histone modifications by ELISA. The DNA methylation rate of Tregs was significantly higher in AAA patients than in the HC group (0.159 ± 0.08% vs 0.098 ± 0.03%, P < 0.05), while the acetylation rates of H3 and H3K9 histones were lower in the AAA than in the HC group.

The sample consisted of 30 patients with indication of tooth intrusion for oral rehabilitation. Teeth were divided into three different groups: G1 (n=10) pre-molars without force or laser application (control); G2 (n=10) upper molar intrusion; and G3 (n=10) upper molar intrusion and PBM. On PBM treated molars, the teeth were irradiated with a low-power diode laser (808nm, 100mW), receiving 1J per point, density of 25 J/cm2 , with application of 10 s per point, 10 points (5 per vestibular and 5 per palatal region). Orthodontic force of intrusion applied every 30 days and PBM was performed immediately, 3 and 7 days after force application for 3 months. Gingival crevicular fluid was collected at the same time periods as the laser applications and interleukins 1-β, 6 and 8 were evaluated by ELISA. Clinical measures were performed monthly to verify the amount of intrusion. The levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β increased under orthodontic force (G2 and G3) when compared to control group (G1), however the citokynes levels were significantly higher after PBM (G3). The mean intrusion velocity was 0.26mm/month in the irradiated group (G3), average duration of 8 months versus 0.17mm/month for the non-irradiated group (G2), average duration of 12 months. This study suggests that PBM accelerates tooth movement during molar intrusion, due to modulation of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β during bone remodeling. This article is protected by copyright.

Globally, disparities range from countries where there is little provision to those where, despite the availability of evidence-based mental health care, service access and outcomes are mediated by social factors such as socio-economic status, race/ethnicity, and culture. This is salient because increasingly diverse populations are inevitably created with globalization. We posit that in multicultural contexts, effective therapeutic engagement requires therapists who are competent and confident to work with diversity and difference, utilizing insights into their own as well as their clients' internal and external worlds. Although there are many reasons why psychotherapies can be insensitive and harmful, for example, the inherent power imbalance in therapeutic relationships, a lack of awareness of cultural and ethnic variation and needs are among them. Acquisition of 'cultural competence' and increasing availability of culturally-adapted interventions should, in theory, enable practitioners to work with a range of individuals with whom they might have little in common. However, whilst cultural adaptation appears promising, there are concerns regarding its viability as a strategy for tackling disparities in access to psychological care. Evidence for cultural competency is patchy at best. We show how and why delivering effective psychotherapy in the twenty-first century requires a paradigm shift from current approaches to truly integrated models, developed in collaboration with recipients of care. Coproducing interventions, training, and means of evaluating them with clients necessitates taking into consideration social contexts, alternative conceptualizations of mental health and disorders and difficulties, and what constitutes appropriate helpful interventions for psychological distress. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Upskilling therapists to work with diversity and difference is essential for effective delivery of psychological treatments. Increasing the availability of culturally-adapted interventions together with therapists who are sufficiently competent and confident to deliver them should enable practitioners to work with a range of individuals with whom they might have little in common. Coproducing culturally appropriate means of responding to mental health difficulties, staff training and development, and service evaluation methods with clients necessitates taking into consideration social contexts, alternative explanatory models of mental health and 'illness', and what constitutes helpful interventions for psychological distress."

Here, it was shown by using as an example the oxidation of a model substrate containing a β-O-4 linkage with H2 O2 and an in situ-prepared manganese-based catalyst, capable of efficient oxidation of benzylic alcohols, that interference from compounds liberated during the reaction can prevent its application to lignocellulose depolymerisation.","The Brassicaceae-specific secreted peptides, STMPs, function in plant growth and pathogen defense.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001913,Journal of integrative plant biology,2019 04 19,"Low molecular weight secreted peptides have recently been shown to affect multiple aspects of plant growth, development, and defense responses. Here, we performed stepwise BLAST filtering to identify unannotated peptides from the Arabidopsis thaliana protein database and uncovered a novel secreted peptide family, secreted transmembrane peptides (STMPs). These low molecular weight peptides, which consist of an N-terminal signal peptide and a transmembrane domain, were primarily localized to extracellular compartments but were also detected in the endomembrane system of the secretory pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis identified 10 STMP family members that are specific to the Brassicaceae family. Brassicaceae plants showed dramatically inhibited root growth upon exposure to chemically synthesized STMP1 and STMP2. Arabidopsis overexpressing STMP1, 2, 4, 6, or 10 exhibited severely arrested growth, suggesting that STMPs are involved in regulating plant growth and development. In addition, in vitro bioassays demonstrated that STMP1, STMP2, and STMP10 have antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, Ralstonia solanacearum, Bacillus subtilis, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, demonstrating that STMPs are antimicrobial peptides.

The p16 tumor suppressor gene regulates cell cycle progression and senescence through binding of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and also regulates cellular oxidative stress independently of cell cycle control. We identified a germline missense (c.350T>C, p.Leu117Pro) CDKN2A mutation in a patient who had history of four primary melanomas, numerous nevi, and self-reported family history of melanoma. This particular CDKN2A mutation has not been previously reported in prior large studies of melanoma kindreds or patients with multiple primary melanomas. Compared with wild-type p16, the p16L117P mutant largely retained binding capacity for CDK4 and CDK6 but exhibited impaired capacity for repressing cell cycle progression and inducing senescence, while retaining its ability to reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Structural modeling predicted that the Leu117Pro mutation disrupts a putative adenosine monophosphate (AMP) binding pocket involving residue 117 in the fourth ankyrin domain.

In the present study, we isolated VSMCs from primary rat artery, applied β-GP (β-glycerophosphate) for inducing VSMCs calcification in vitro to explore the mechanism of phosphate-induced calcification in VSMCs. Alizarin red staining was performed to assess the mineralization in VSMCs. Calcium deposition experiment was taken to evaluate the calcium content. ALP staining was determined to assess the ALP activity. The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed for the overexpression of Klotho and FGF23, respectively. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were subjected to measure the expression of Klotho/FGF23 and correlated genes among Wnt7b/β-catenin pathway. We found that the calcium content was obviously increased and Alizarin red staining was positive in calcification group exposure with high phosphate in a time-dependent manner. The expression of Klotho and FGF23 was significantly decreased in the calcification group. However, overexpression of Klotho and FGF23 markedly reversed VSMCs calcification stimulating with high phosphate treatment. Moreover, Wnt7b/β-catenin inhibitor DKK1 could partly attenuate the effect of high phosphate on calcified VSMCs. These findings demonstrated that Klotho/FGF23 axis could modulate high phosphate-induced VSMCs calcification via Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings unravel that Klotho/FGF23- Wnt7b/β-catenin axis functions as a crucial role in the VSMCs calcification."

Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping was conducted to explore the most regulatable gene expressions by CNVs among the whole genome based on publicly available data. Then a case-control study was performed to evaluate the associations between copy numbers of the most regulatable genes and colorectal cancer. The influence of the target CNVs on the expression of corresponding gene and protein was verified in colorectal tissue, and the biological effects of these CNVs on cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of colon cancer cell lines were further detected. The eQTL revealed the most significant association between CNV of HM3_CNP_342 and gene expressions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 among the whole genome. The later case-control study found that amplified HLA-DQB1 was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.93), especially among those with a family history of cancer. The positive association between amplified HLA-DQB1 and upregulation of gene and protein was validated in colorectal tissue. In addition, overexpression of HLA-DQB1 in dendritic cells promoted cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of cocultured SW480 and HCT116 cell lines, and vice versa. Our study suggests that the amplified copy number of HLA-DQB1 is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer and able to induce the apoptosis of colon cancer cells, which implies the potential of HLA class II in cancer predisposition and immunotherapy.",Navigating difficult conversations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001875,Journal of surgical oncology,2019 06 10,"Breaking bad news and navigating difficult conversations is challenging and a frequent occurrence in surgical oncology practice.

Studying the roles of rice miRNAs is of great significance for the disease control. Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses. Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M. oryzae by suppressing its target gene. The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 h post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M. oryzae infection. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains. By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease. In addition, knocking out the target gene ARF12 led to hyper-susceptibility to multiple blast fungal strains. Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M. oryzae by downregulating ARF12. Thus, Osa-miR167d-ARF12 regulatory module could be valuable in improvement of blast-disease resistance.","A gamma-thionin protein from apple, MdD1, is required for defence against S-RNase-induced inhibition of pollen tube prior to self/non-self recognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001872,Plant biotechnology journal,2019 05 18,"Apple exhibits S-RNase-mediated self-incompatibility. Although the cytotoxic effect of S-RNase inside the self-pollen tube has been studied extensively, the underlying defence mechanism in pollen tube in Rosaceae remains unclear. On exposure to stylar S-RNase, plant defence responses are activated in the pollen tube; however, how these are regulated is currently poorly understood. Here, we show that entry of both self and non-self S-RNase into pollen tubes of apple (Malus domestica) stimulates jasmonic acid (JA) production, in turn inducing the accumulation of MdMYC2 transcripts, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway widely considered to be involved in plant defence processes. MdMYC2 acts as a positive regulator in the pollen tube activating expression of MdD1, a gene encoding a defence protein. Importantly, MdD1 was shown to bind to the RNase activity sites of S-RNase leading to inhibition of enzymatic activity. This work provides intriguing insights into an ancient defence mechanism present in apple pollen tubes where MdD1 likely acts as a primary line of defence to inhibit S-RNase cytotoxicity prior to self/non-self recognition.",Biochemical recurrence-free conditional probability after radical prostatectomy: A dynamic prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001870,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,2019 04 19,To estimate the conditional biochemical recurrence-free probability and to develop a predictive model according to the disease-free interval for men with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with minimally invasive radical prostatectomy.,Minimally invasive versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: An analysis from the U.S. neuroendocrine tumor study group.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001868,Journal of surgical oncology,2019 04 19,To determine short- and long-term oncologic outcomes after minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) with open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET).,Follow-up outcomes of benign vascular lesions of breast diagnosed on core needle biopsy: A study of 117 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001867,The breast journal,2019 04 26,"Benign vascular lesions of breast are uncommon findings on core biopsy and surgical excision has been recommended to rule out a more serious lesion.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms of miR-143 regulating proliferation and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, we evaluated the levels of miR-143 and formin-like protein 1 (FMNL1) in NPC tissues. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that the expression of miR-143 was decreased, while FMNL1 was increased in NPC tissues. The expression of miR-143 was significantly elevated in NPC cells compared with that of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. The results of MiRcode prediction, dual-luciferase reporter, and Western blot analysis assays indicated that miR-143 negatively regulated the expression of FMNL1 (r2  = 0.4365P = 0.0001). Overexperssion of miR-143 or FMNL1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC cells (P < 0.05). Ectopic expression of FMNL1 undermined the inhibition effect of miR-143 on proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC cells.

Here, we identify two transcription factors, ActR and SoxR, that play contrasting yet complementary roles in the tolerance of the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens to phenazines. We show that ActR promotes phenazine tolerance by proactively driving expression of a more energy-efficient terminal oxidase at the expense of a less efficient alternative, which may affect the rate at which phenazines abstract electrons from the electron transport chain (ETC) and thereby generate reactive oxygen species. SoxR, on the other hand, responds to phenazines by inducing expression of several efflux pumps and redox-related genes, including one of three copies of superoxide dismutase and five novel members of its regulon that could not be computationally predicted. Notably, loss of ActR is far more detrimental than loss of SoxR at low concentrations of phenazines, and also increases dependence on the otherwise functionally redundant SoxR-regulated superoxide dismutase. Our results thus raise the intriguing possibility that the composition of an organism's ETC may be the driving factor in determining sensitivity or tolerance to redox-active compounds.",Astragaloside attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced cell apoptosis in human gingiva cells via MAPK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001851,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,"The aim of this study was to research the antiapoptotic effect of astragaloside, the principal component of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bge, in human gingiva cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",Deceased Organ Donor Factors Influencing Pancreatic Graft Transplantation and Survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001850,Clinical transplantation,2019 04 19,"Criteria for organ acceptance in brain dead organ donors remain inconsistent, especially when concerning pancreatic transplants. We sought to examine donor-specific predictors of pancreatic graft use and survival to better guide the selection and management of potential donors. A prospective observational study of all donors from ten organ procurement organizations was conducted from March 2012 to January 2015. Critical care end points were collected at 4 standardized time points. Data associated with pancreatic transplantation and graft survival rates were first determined using univariate analyses, and then logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of these two outcomes. From 1819 donors, 238 (13.1%) pancreata were transplanted, and at a mean follow-up of 192 days, 218 (91.6%) grafts had survived. After regression analysis, donor age (OR=0.89), HgbA1C (OR=0.07), and achieving the Donor Management Goal (DMG) for Ejection Fraction at Allocation of ≥50% (OR=3.29) remained as independent predictors of pancreatic utilization. On regression analysis, graft survival was independently predicted by lower donor age (OR = 0.93) and achieving the DMGs for Mean Arterial Pressure (60-110 mmHg) and Glucose (≤180 mg/dL) at separate time points. These results may help guide the management and selection of potential pancreatic donors after brain death. This article is protected by copyright.

The development of tamoxifen resistance commonly occurrs during the treatment of patients with breast cancer whereas its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we found that miR-24-3p regulated tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Forced overexpression of miR-24-3p augmented tamoxifen-induced cell viability inhibition in breast cancer cells, while knockdown of miR-24-3p partially attenuated the cytotoxicity effect of tamoxifen. Moreover, we discovered Bim as a target gene of miR-24-3p in breast cancer cells by RNA immunoprecipitation, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and dual luciferase reporter assay. In our established tamoxifen resistant MCF7 cell line (MCF7/TAM), there was a significant elevation of miR-24-3p and decrease of BIM expression compared with parental MCF7 cells. In addition, the inhibition of miR-24-3p could reverse the tamoxifen resistance of MCF7/TAM cells by the induction of cell apoptosis. Silencing of Bim expression blocked miR-24-3p inhibitor-induced elevation of tamoxifen sensitivity of MCF7/TAM cells. Using tumor tissues from patients with breast cancer, we also found that the expression of miR-24-3p was negatively correlated with Bim mRNA expression. Collectively, our study highlighted the pivotal role of miR-24-3p overexpression in mediating the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer and suggested miR-24-3p might be a predictor or target for patients with breast cancer.","A novel player in the field: Merkel disc in touch, itch and pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001848,Experimental dermatology,2019 05 20,"The mechanosensitive Merkel cell-neurite complex comprising two distinct cell types in both hairy and glabrous skin has been widely recognized as touch receptor for more than 100 years.

Our laboratory previously reported HOPO as equivocal in the Ames assay following extensive testing of multiple lots of material. Given the lack of reproducibility between lots of material and the weak increase in revertants observed, it was concluded that it would be highly unlikely that HOPO would pose a mutagenic risk in vivo. The purpose of the current investigation was to assess experimentally in rats the mutagenic (Pig-a mutation induction) and more broadly genotoxic (micronucleus and comet induction) potential of HOPO. Rats were administered HOPO (0, 50, 150, 300, and 500 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 28 days. At the end of study, the following parameters were assessed: frequency of Pig-a mutant red blood cells and reticulocytes, frequency of peripheral blood micronuclei, and the incidence of comet formation in liver. Toxicokinetic data collected on study Days 1 and 28 demonstrated systemic exposure to HOPO. Although there were no overt clinical signs, animals treated with HOPO showed a dose-related decrease in body weight gain. There were no increases observed in any of the genotoxicity endpoints assessed. The results from this study further support the conclusion that in the context of pharmaceutical synthesis, HOPO should not be considered a mutagenic impurity but rather controlled as a normal process-related impurity.

Proteomic analyses using rodent brain samples revealed enrichment of CYLD in purified postsynaptic density fractions. Here, we report that CYLD regulates dendritic growth and postsynaptic differentiation in mouse hippocampal neurons. CYLD showed diffuse localization in rapidly growing dendrites, but was gradually concentrated in spines. Overexpression and knockdown of CYLD in the early stage of cultured neurons demonstrated that CYLD positively regulated dendritic growth. Phenotypes in dendritic morphogenesis induced by CYLD overexpression and knockdown could be reversed by manipulation of the critical acetylation site of α-tubulin, suggesting tubulin acetylation is a downstream pathway of CYLD-dependent dendritic growth. Overexpression and knockdown of CYLD in the later stage of cultured neurons revealed that CYLD promoted formation of postsynaptic spines. Influence of CYLD on spines was not affected by co-expression of acetylation mutant forms of α-tubulin, indicating that CYLD regulates dendritic growth and spine formation through different molecular mechanisms. Analyses with the truncated and mutated forms of CYLD demonstrated that the first microtubule-binding domain of CYLD was critical for spine formation. These results suggest important roles of CYLD in sequential promotion of dendritic growth and postsynaptic spine maturation."

Greater phagotrophic activity could reinforce the bypass of carbon (C) flux through the bacteria-mixotroph link and thus lead to a more efficient transfer of C and other nutrients to the top of the trophic web. To determine whether foreseeable changes in temperature and UVR upset the mixotrophic trade-off in favor of one or the other nutritional strategy along the mixotrophic gradient is key to understanding the fate of C and mineral nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem. Two main hypotheses arise: (i) that increased warming and UVR will divert metabolism toward phagotrophy, and (ii) that the magnitude of this shift will vary according to the organism's position along the mixotrophic gradient. To test these hypotheses, we used two protists (Isochrysis galbana and Chromulina sp.) located in different positions on the mixotrophic gradient, subjecting them to the action of T and of UVR and their interaction. Our results show that the joint action of the two factors increased the primary production:bacterivory ratio and stoichiometric values (N:P ratio) close to Redfield's ratio. Therefore, T and UVR shifted the metabolism of both organisms toward greater phototrophy regardless of original position of the organism on the mixotrophic gradient.

Analysis of cytochrome oxidase I gene (coI) sequence variation exposed extremely high levels of genetic differentiation among samples from across the geographic range of the species (up to 18%), certainly much greater than the traditionally employed c. 3% sequence divergence heuristic threshold for conspecifics. Phylogeographic analyses of coI data revealed eight clusters/clades that diverge by >4% and up to 18% (p-distance), potentially representing cryptic members of a species complex. A clear biogeographic pattern was also uncovered, in which the two main coI lineages corresponded geographically with the upper Guinea (UG) and lower Guinea (LG) ichthyofaunal provinces of continental Africa, respectively. Within each of these main lineages, however, no apparent phylogeographic structuring was found. Despite strong genetic differentiation, there is considerable overlap in body shape variation between UG and LG populations. For the most part, morphological variation does not match the strength of the molecular phylogeographic signal. Therefore, the ability to reliably utilise external body shape for regional delimitation remains elusive.

To reach this level of organization, early stages in development must include an efficient control of cellular events and regulation of intracellular signaling molecules and ions such as hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and calcium (Ca2+ ), but in cerebral tissue, these mechanisms of regulation are still poorly understood. Hexokinase (HK) is the first enzyme in the metabolism of glucose and, when bound to mitochondria (mtHK), it has been proposed to have a role in modulation of mitochondrial H2 O2  generation and Ca2+ handling. Here, we have investigated how mtHK modulates these signals in the mitochondrial context during postnatal development of the mouse brain. Using high-resolution respirometry, western blot analysis, spectrometry and resorufin, and Calcium Green fluorescence assays with brain mitochondria purified postnatally from day 1 to day 60, we demonstrate that brain HK increases its coupling to mitochondria and to oxidative phosphorylation to induce a cycle of ADP entry/ATP exit of the mitochondrial matrix that leads to efficient control over H2 O2 generation and Ca2+ uptake during development until reaching plateau at day 21. This contrasts sharply with the antioxidant enzymes, which do not increase as mitochondrial H2 O2 generation escalates. These results suggest that, as its use of glucose increases, the brain couples HK to mitochondria to improve glucose metabolism, redox balance and Ca2+ signaling during development, positioning mitochondria-bound hexokinase as a hub for intracellular signaling control.",Root inoculation of green bell pepper (Capsicum annum) with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BBC047: effect on biochemical composition and antioxidant capacity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001829,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 05 15,"Consumption of bell peppers is recommended because of their bioactive compound content and their positive effects on health.

In humans, hypergammaglobulinemia is prediction of disease progression. Nevertheless, the contribution of hypermutated and/or class-switched immunoglobulins to disease pathogenesis has never been studied. Using Aicda-/- mice and the experimental model of Leishmania donovani infection, we demonstrate that the absence of hypermutated and/or class-switched antibodies was associated with increased resistance to disease, stronger protective Th1 responses, and a lower frequency of regulatory IFNγ+ IL-10+ CD4 T cells. Interestingly, stronger Th1 responses and the absence of IFNγ+ IL-10+ CD4 T cells during chronic infection in infected Aicda-/- mice were not caused by a T-cell intrinsic effect of AID, but by changes in the cytokine environment during chronic disease. Indeed TNF, IL-10 and IFN-ß expressions were only upregulated in the presence of hypermutated, class-switched antibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia at later stages of infection.

Central components of the JC hypothesis are non-competitive effects of distance- and density-dependence, two drivers that contribute independently to species coexistence, but which are ultimately linked in the field. However, while numerous studies provide evidence for either distance- or density-dependent effects based on observational data, experimental testing of simultaneous and interactive effects of distance and density has rarely been conducted yet, especially in a comprehensive multispecies approach. Here, we make use of the forest Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning project BEF-China to estimate distance- and density-dependent effects in a reciprocal tree seedling transplant experiment of eleven tree species. We deployed 13,490 juveniles of all eleven species in their own (home) and in all foreign monocultures (away) as well as at three different levels of planting density, thereby testing for distance and density effects, respectively. In addition, to quantify the amount as to which density effects were brought about by potential additional effects of intraspecific competition, we set up a Common Garden Experiment with different levels of planting density, where an additional 'shadow' treatment controlled for effects of canopy shading. While the 'away' and 'high-density' treatments significantly impaired the performance and productivity of seedlings, leaf damage and survival was exclusively affected by either the home/away- or the density-treatment, respectively. Negative density-dependent effects on leaf damage were less pronounced in the 'home' treatment, showing that the effects were not additive. In addition, results obtained in the Common Garden Experiment showed that negative effects of high density may be also brought about by intraspecific competition as an alternative density-responsive mechanism and less by true JC effects. Overall, our results provide strong support on a multi-species basis for the influence of host-specific effects already operating in early stages of a forest plantation. However, they also emphasize the need to appropriately account for potential additional density-responsive mechanisms such as intraspecific competition or micro-environmental conditions when addressing the role of JC effects for species coexistence.

In a pilot explorative study, 14 adolescents with at least one parent who migrated were interviewed about their lived experiences of transnational parent-child relationships and ongoing parent-child separation. Data analysis identified four themes in participants' accounts: practices of separation creating confusion; current relationship with migrant parents permeated by ambiguity; distrustful representations of migrant parents; and family and social dynamics reactivating the pain of loss. The findings reveal how in the context of parental migration, patterns of separation and ongoing relational processes, compounded by the uncertainty of reunification and an exclusionary social fabric, constitute core elements that shape adolescents' lived experiences of parent-child relationships characterized by ambiguity."

This narrative review summarizes the evidence for health providers, drawing attention to current guidelines on which contraceptive methods can be used, and when they should be started after pregnancy, whatever its outcome. Fertility returns within 1 month of the end of pregnancy unless breastfeeding occurs. Breastfeeding, which itself suppresses fertility after childbirth, influences both when contraception should start and what methods can be used. Without breastfeeding, effective contraception should be started as soon as possible if another pregnancy is to be avoided. Interpregnancy intervals of at least 6 months after miscarriage and 1-2 years after childbirth have long been recommended by the World Health Organization in order to reduce the chance of adverse pregnancy outcome. Recent research suggests that this may not be necessary, at least for healthy women <35 years old. Most contraceptive methods can be used after pregnancy regardless of the outcome. Because of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives, initiation of these methods should be delayed until 6 weeks after childbirth. More research is required to settle the questions over the use of combined hormonal contraception during breastfeeding, the use of injectable progestin-only contraceptives before 6 weeks after childbirth, and the use of both hormonal and intrauterine contraception after gestational trophoblastic disease. The potential impact on the risk of ectopic pregnancy of certain contraceptive methods often confuses healthcare providers. The challenges involved in providing effective, seamless service provision of contraception after pregnancy are numerous, even in industrialized countries. Nevertheless, the clear benefits demonstrate that it is worth the effort.",Prediagnostic blood levels of organochlorines and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in three prospective cohorts in China and Singapore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001807,International journal of cancer,2019 05 23,"Specific organochlorines (OCs) have been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with varying degrees of evidence. These associations have not been evaluated in Asia, where the high exposure and historical environmental contamination of certain OC pesticides (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], hexachlorocyclohexane [HCH]) are different from Western populations. We evaluated NHL risk and prediagnostic blood levels of OC pesticides/metabolites and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners in a case-control study of 167 NHL cases and 167 controls nested within three prospective cohorts in Shanghai and Singapore. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze lipid-adjusted OC levels and NHL risk. Median levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), the primary DDT metabolite, and β-HCH were up to 12 and 65 times higher, respectively, in samples from the Asian cohorts compared to several cohorts in the United States and Norway. An increased risk of NHL was observed among those with higher β-HCH levels both overall (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.0-3.2; ptrend = 0.049) and after excluding cases diagnosed within 2 years of blood collection (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 2.0, 95%CI = 1.1-3.9; ptrend = 0.03), and the association was highly consistent across the three cohorts. No significant associations were observed for other OCs, including p,p'-DDE. Our findings provide support for an association between β-HCH blood levels and NHL risk. This is a concern because substantial quantities of persistent, toxic residues of HCH are present in the environment worldwide. Although there is some evidence that DDT is associated with NHL, our findings for p,p'-DDE do not support an association.",Paip2 cooperates with Cbp80 at an active promoter and participates in RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001806,FEBS letters,2019 06 10,"The Paip2 protein is a factor regulating mRNA translation and stability in the cytoplasm. It has also been found in the nuclei of several cell types in Drosophila. Here, we aim to elucidate the functions of Paip2 in the cell nucleus. We find that nuclear Paip2 is a component of an ~300-kDa protein complex. Paip2 interacts with mRNA capping factor and factors of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation and early elongation. Paip2 functionally cooperates with the Cbp80 subunit of the cap-binding complex, with both proteins ensuring proper Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) Ser5 phosphorylation at the promoter. Thus, Paip2 is a novel player at the stage of mRNA capping and early Pol II elongation.",High-resolution genomic alterations in Barrett's metaplasia of patients who progress to esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001805,International journal of cancer,2019 05 02,"The main risk factor for esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (DAC) is Barrett's esophagus (BE), characterized by intestinal metaplasia. The critical genomic mechanisms that lead to progression of nondysplastic BE to DAC remain poorly understood and require analyses of longitudinal patient cohorts and high-resolution assays. We tested BE tissues from 74 patients, including 42 nonprogressors from two separate groups of 21 patients each and 32 progressors (16 in a longitudinal cohort before DAC/preprogression-BE and 16 with temporally concurrent but spatially separate DAC/concurrent-BE). We interrogated genome-wide somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) at the exon level with high-resolution SNP arrays in DNA from formalin-fixed samples histologically confirmed as nondysplastic BE. The most frequent abnormalities were SCNAs involving FHIT exon 5, CDKN2A/B or both in 88% longitudinal BE progressors to DAC vs. 24% in both nonprogressor groups (p = 0.0004). Deletions in other genomic regions were found in 56% of preprogression-BE but only in one nonprogressor-BE (p = 0.0004). SCNAs involving FHIT exon 5 and CDKN2A/B were also frequently detected in BE temporally concurrent with DAC. TP53 losses were detected in concurrent-BE but not earlier in preprogression-BE tissues of patients who developed DAC. CDKN2A/p16 immunohistochemistry showed significant loss of expression in BE of progressors vs. nonprogressors, supporting the genomic data. Our data suggest a role for CDKN2A/B and FHIT in early progression of BE to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma that warrants future mechanistic research. Alterations in CDKN2A/B and FHIT by high-resolution assays may serve as biomarkers of increased risk of progression to DAC when detected in BE tissues.",Boundary condition nomenclature confusion in groundwater flow modelling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001804,Ground water,2019 04 19,"To solve the partial differential equations of groundwater flow, the information about head (h) and/or head gradient (∇h) must be specified along the boundaries of a model domain.

The marginal division (MrD) of the striatum is a newly discovered subdivision at the ventromedial border of the mammalian striatum and is considered to be one part of the ventral striatum involved in learning and memory. The present study provided evidence to support the hypothesis that the MrD and the NBM were structurally connected at cellular and subcellular levels with functional implications in learning and memory. First, when wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was stereotaxically injected into the NBM, fusiform neurons in the MrD were retrogradely labeled with WGA-HRP gray-blue particles and some of them were double stained in brown color by AchE staining method. Thus, cholinergic neurons of the MrD were shown to project to the neurons in the NBM. Second, in anterograde tract-tracing experiments where WGA-HRP was injected to the MrD, the labeled WGA-HRP was found to be anterogradely transported in axons from the MrD to the synaptic terminals with dendrites, axons, and perikaryons of the cholinergic neurons in the NBM when observed under an electronic microscope, indicating reciprocal structural connections between the MrD and the NBM. Third, when bilateral lesions of the MrD were injured with kainic acid in rats, degenerative terminals were observed in synapses of the NBM by an electronic microscope and severe learning and memory deficiency was found in these rats by the Y-maze behavioral test. Our results suggest reciprocal cholinergic connections between the MrD of the ventral striatum and the NBM, and implicate a role of the MrD-NBM pathway in learning and memory. The efferent fibers of cholinergic neurons in the NBM mainly project to the cortex, and severe reduction of the cholinergic innervation in the cortex is the common feature of Alzheimer's patients. The newly discovered cholinergic neural pathway between the MrD of the ventral striatum and the NBM is supposed involved in the memory circuitries of the brain and probably might play a role in the pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease.",Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) Reduces Rat Neuropathic Pain by Modulating Opioid Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001801,Molecular neurobiology,2019 04 19,"The impact of vitamin D on sensory function, including pain processing, has been receiving increasing attention. Indeed, vitamin D deficiency is associated with various chronic pain conditions, and several lines of evidence indicate that vitamin D supplementation may trigger pain relief. However, the underlying mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We used inflammatory and non-inflammatory rat models of chronic pain to evaluate the benefits of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) on pain symptoms. We found that cholecalciferol supplementation improved mechanical nociceptive thresholds in monoarthritic animals and reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in a model of mononeuropathy. Transcriptomic analysis of cerebrum, dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord tissues indicate that cholecalciferol supplementation induces a massive gene dysregulation which, in the cerebrum, is associated with opioid signaling (23 genes), nociception (14), and allodynia (8), and, in the dorsal root ganglia, with axonal guidance (37 genes) and nociception (17). Among the identified cerebral dysregulated nociception-, allodynia-, and opioid-associated genes, 21 can be associated with vitamin D metabolism. However, it appears that their expression is modulated by intermediate regulators such as diverse protein kinases and not, as expected, by the vitamin D receptor. Overall, several genes-Oxt, Pdyn, Penk, Pomc, Pth, Tac1, and Tgfb1-encoding for peptides/hormones stand out as top candidates to explain the therapeutic benefit of vitamin D3 supplementation. Further studies are now warranted to detail the precise mechanisms of action but also the most favorable doses and time windows for pain relief.",A Previously Unrecognized Monocytic Component of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001800,Endocrine pathology,2019 06 10,"We describe a consistently present, previously unrecognized, population of monocytes in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Although sustentacular cells are generally recognized as a common component of these tumors, differential immunohistochemical staining for CD163 and S100 shows that monocytes can in fact be more numerous. These cells frequently resemble sustentacular cells topographically and cytologically, possibly explaining why they have not been previously noticed. They contribute to the tumor proteome and may have implications for tumor biology. No correlations were identifiable between the presence of these cells and any clinical characteristics of the tumors in the present study. A possible association with genotype is suggested by immunoblot showing high expression of CD163 protein in tumors with succinate dehydrogenase mutations.","Expression of Prox1 in Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma Is Associated with Chromogranin A and Calcitonin Expression and with Ki67 Proliferative Index, but Not with Prognosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001799,Endocrine pathology,2019 06 10,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has been shown to express Prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1), a transcription factor whose expression is altered in a variety of human cancers. We conducted a retrospective study on a series of 32 patients with MTC to test the correlation of Prox1 expression in MTC with clinicopathological features and to evaluate its prognostic significance. Correlation of Prox1 immunohistochemical expression with tumor size, proliferative index (Ki67), and calcitonin and CEA serum levels prior to surgery was tested for significant correlations. The difference in Prox1 and Ki67 immunohistochemical expression according to the immunohistochemical staining intensity of CEA, chromogranin A, and calcitonin was tested using the Kruskal-Wallis H test and linear regression analysis. The prognostic value of Prox1 and Ki67 for our patient cohort was assessed by Kaplan-Meier log rank survival analysis. We demonstrated a positive correlation between Prox1 expression and Ki67 index. Prox1 also showed significant difference in expression according to chromogranin A and calcitonin immunohistochemical expression, with higher Prox1 expression in tumors with stronger chromogranin A or calcitonin staining. Prox1 expression did not correlate with PFS or OS based on Kaplan-Meier log rank survival analysis. In conclusion, Prox1 expression in MTC is positively correlated with Ki67 and with the immunohistochemical expression of chromogranin A and calcitonin. However, the present study does not support a role for Prox1 in MTC prognosis.",Circulating free DNA concentration as a marker of disease recurrence and metastatic potential in lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001798,Clinical and translational medicine,2019 05 05,"Plasma circulating cell-free (cf) DNA is regarded as a source of tumor DNA.

The synthesis pattern of these antimicrobial peptides by P. alvei NP75 was studied extensively. The results were outstanding in a way that the paenibacillin N was synthesized irrespective of the growth of bacteria (non-ribosomal mediated), whereas paenibacillin P production was carried out by ribosomal mediated. In addition to the antimicrobial peptides, P. alvei NP75 also produces an immunogenic extracellular protease to defend itself from its own antimicrobial peptide, paenibacillin P. Furthermore, this immunogenic protease production was impaired by the addition of protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treated strain (mutant) failed to produce paenibacillin P, whereas the production of neither paenibacillin N nor the protease was affected by the plasmid curing. The plasmid curing studies that divulge the genes responsible for the synthesis of paenibacillin N and protease were found to be genome encoded, and paenibacillin P was plasmid encoded. We are reporting, first of its kind, the co-production of two different antimicrobial peptides from P. alvei NP75 through non-ribosomal and ribosomal pathways that could be used as effective antibiotics.",Antimicrobial Peptide JH-3 Effectively Kills Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Strain CVCC541 and Reduces Its Pathogenicity in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001786,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2019 04 19,"Salmonella is an important zoonotic pathogen and is a major cause of gastrointestinal diseases worldwide. The current serious problem of antibiotic abuse has prompted the search for new substitutes for antibiotics. JH-3 is a small antimicrobial peptide with broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. In this study, we showed that JH-3 has good bactericidal activity towards the clinical isolate Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain CVCC541. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of JH-3 against this bacterium was determined to be 100 μg/mL, which could decrease the number of CVCC541 cells by 1000-fold in vitro within 5 h. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results showed that JH-3 can damage the cell wall and membrane of CVCC541, leading to the leakage of cell contents and subsequent cell death. To measure the bactericidal activity of CVCC541-infected mice were treated intraperitoneally 40 or 10 mg/kg JH-3 at 2 h or 3 days postinfection. Our results showed that treatment with 40 mg/kg JH-3 at 2 h postinfection had the best therapeutic effect and could significantly protect mice from a lethal dose of CVCC541. Furthermore, the clinical symptoms, bacterial burden in blood and organs, and intestinal pathological changes were all decreased and were close to normal. This study examined the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial peptide JH-3 against S. enterica CVCC541 infection for the first time and determined the therapeutic effect of different JH-3 doses and treatment times, laying the foundation for studies of new antimicrobial agents.",A single enzyme PCR-RFLP assay targeting V1-V3 region of 16S rRNA gene for direct identification of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris from other Alicyclobacillus species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001785,Journal of applied genetics,2019 04 29,"Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is considered to be one of the most important target microorganisms in quality control of heat-processed acidic foods. This species can cause spoilage by forming spores with very high heat resistance; however, no gas production or visible changes occur in the contaminated product during storage. Thus, the differentiation of A. acidoterrestris from other Alicyclobacillus species is of great importance. Τhe present study aims to find a rapid method for the identification of A. acidoterrestris. To achieve this, 78 Alicyclobacillus isolates were subjected to PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism). Specifically, PCR products of amplified V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene were digested with restriction endonuclease HhaI. According to the obtained results, all A. acidoterrestris isolates showed similar restriction fragments of the 16S rRNA gene and different from A. acidocaldarius and A. hesperidum. In conclusion, a single enzyme PCR-RFLP assay was developed and showed rapid, inexpensive and direct identification of Alicyclobacillus isolates. The application of this method will be useful to identify this contaminant in fruit juices.",Cadmium accumulation in winter crops and the assessment of paddy soil phytoremediation in southern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001784,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"Heavy metal pollution, in particular with cadmium (Cd), threatens both the environment and human health. The phytoremediation of contaminated soil is one recently developed eco-friendly technique that can be applied to mitigate this issue. Repairing Cd-contaminated paddy soil during the fallow winter period can ensure future rice production while reducing heavy metal pollution. Seven winter crops were planted in this study to investigate the accumulation of this metal in mid-level Cd and low-level lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)-contaminated paddy soils. Results show that after 4 or 5 months of growth, all crops had become moderately tolerant to toxicity; indeed, shoot Cd bioconcentration factor (BCF) values were 37.4, 17.0, 11.5, 10.5, 5.8, 3.9, and 1.4 for Sedum alfredii (SA), Witloof chicory (WC), edible-leaf beet (EB), Cardamine hupingshanensis (CH), leafy mustard (LM), oil mustard (OM), and perennial ryegrass (PR), respectively, while shoot Pb and Zn BCF values were less than 1 and 5, respectively. And SA, WC, EB, and CH all had higher shoot Cd accumulation capacities, especially SA in which the level reached 53.9 mg kg-1. The calculation results of restoration potential show that it will take at least 5 years for WC, 7 years for SA and EB, and 10 years for CH to reach the repair target. These results show that it is possible to grow winter crops to repair soil Cd pollution, with WC, EB, CH, and SA, the best candidates for making full use of fallow periods while simultaneously achieving soil phytoremediation. The results of this study will prove useful for establishing a new summer production model by ensuring the winter repair of contaminated paddy soil.",Use of marble sludge waste in the manufacture of eco-friendly materials: applying the principles of the Circular Economy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001783,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"The marble industry generates enormous amounts of waste every year, whose incorrect management can lead to environmental problems. The Circular Economy model can provide an effective solution to this issue, an aspect that has been addressed in this research. The suitability of a marble sludge generated in the ornamental rock industry of Andalusia (Spain) has been assessed as raw material in ceramic bricks. Mixtures containing a clayey base and 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt% of marble powder have been shaped into 60 × 30 × 10-mm3 prismatic specimens and sintered at 950 °C in a muffle. The main technological properties of the bricks related to color, shrinkage, porosity, water absorption, suction, and compressive strength have been determined. The addition of marble sludge has fostered the development of a lighter color, together with a significant increase of the open porosity. This aspect has implied, on the one hand, higher water absorption and suction results and, on the other hand, a decrease of the density and the mechanical strength. The correlations obtained after applying Shapiro-Wilk normality tests and r Pearson coefficients endorse the clear relationship between the addition of marble powder and the abovementioned effects on the technological properties of the sintered bricks. All the measured properties fully meet the brick standardized requirements, which would indicate that the recycling of marble wastes could be a promising alternative to obtain eco-friendly lightweight ceramic materials.",Assessment of the structural reorganization of liver and biochemical parameters of blood serum after introduction of zinc nanoparticles and its oxides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001782,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"The demand for nanoparticles of metals and their oxides in medicine and biology is indisputable. To ensure the safe use of the unique capabilities of nanostructures, in particular, essential metals and their oxides, and to further search for ways leveling side effects of toxic effects in biomedical applications, a multifaceted approach to the study of their properties is needed, primarily affecting the effects on the organism level. In this connection, the purpose of the present research was to study the effect of zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on structural reorganization of the liver and morpho-biochemical parameters of rat blood. The test substances exhibit a hepatotoxic effect upon their single intraperitoneal administration to rats. In the experiment, increased activity of gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased expression of caspase-3, the presence of signs of oxidative stress, inflammation, and capillary-trophic insufficiency, and induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and colony stimulating factor 2 (granulocyte-macrophage) (GM-CSF) were registered in the experiment. The level of interferon-γ in the experimental groups tended to decrease in comparison with the control group. The observed effects progressed in time, most noticeably manifested in the case of ZnONPs. Comparing the dosages, ZnNPs are less toxic than ZnONPs.",Hard Cr2O3 coatings on SS316L substrates prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering technique: a potential candidate for orthopedic implants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001781,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"316L stainless steel (SS) implants suffer from tribological and biocompatibility problems which limit their service lifetime. In order to improve the surface properties of 316L SS for orthopedic implant applications, hard chromium oxide coatings were applied on 316L SS substrates using a reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The morphological, structural, and phase compositional analyses were conducted on the deposited coatings by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Rockwell-C indentation tests were performed on the coated substrates to qualitatively evaluate the adhesion of coatings on the steel substrates. The surface characteristics of coatings were measured by using an optical profilometer. The mechanical properties of coatings were reported by measuring the Hardness and Young's modulus. The corrosion resistance of coated and uncoated SS substrates was compared using potentiodynamic polarization tests. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was employed to analyze the biocompatibility of the samples by measuring the amount of toxic Cr ions released after the immersion test. The results show that the coatings are adherent and composed of a single Cr2O3 phase with a hardness of 25 to 29 GPa. The corrosion resistance of the SS has been improved by applying a chromium oxide coating. The coated SS samples have also demonstrated better wear resistance and lower friction coefficient compared to bare SS samples under a reciprocating sliding condition in saline solution. The biocompatibility of the SS has been enhanced by the Cr2O3 coating as much less Cr ions were released after immersion tests. These results indicate that the hard Cr2O3 coatings can be considered as a candidate for extending the lifetime of SS implants.",Distribution and source apportionment of hydrocarbons in sediments of oil-producing continental margin: a fuzzy logic approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001780,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"Investigation were carried out targeting distribution and source apportioning of hydrocarbons in surface sediments from shallow to deep waters in the Campos Basin, one of the most important oil-producing provinces in Brazil. The observed levels of aliphatic (≤ 124 μg g-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs ≤ 599 ng g-1) are lower than those considered relevant for environmental risk to the benthic habitats. Higher median concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons (8.49 μg g-1) and PAHs (84.8 ng g-1) in the middle slope sediments (700-1000-m water depths) showed the influence of hydrodynamics upon hydrocarbon accumulation in the sediments. Diagnostic ratios and conventional statistical analysis applied to hydrocarbon data produced insufficient information on the contribution of different sources. These traditional approaches do not consider the potential changes affecting source assignment and therefore cannot deal with the uncertainties. The fuzzy logic applied as an alternative method for data treatment successfully incorporated the uncertainties in the differentiation between petrogenic and pyrolytic sources, including those due to degradation. Moreover, by using fuzzy logic, it was possible to identify that water circulation patterns, mass transport, deposition, and degradation processes are more relevant factors in determining hydrocarbon composition than source proximity.",Characterization of earthworm α-amylases for dietary supplement development and biomass utilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001779,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 19,"Earthworms are useful soil-decomposing animals that possess various saccharification enzymes such as cellulases and amylases.

We previously developed a novel earthworm dietary supplement with fibrinolytic, cellulase, and amylase activities using high-pressure technology. However, the optimal temperature and pH required for amylase activity in bioindustry have not yet been investigated. In the present study, we purified and characterized two α-amylases of Eisenia fetida Waki, EfAMY1 and EfAMY2, which were monomeric enzymes of 63.8 kDa and 64.0 kDa, with specific activities of 69.2 and 40.4 units/mg, respectively. The optimal pH was 5.5 for both enzymes, and the optimal temperatures were 45 °C and 35 °C for EfAMY1 and EfAMY2, respectively; however, the enzymes were stable over a wide pH range (5-10) and at high temperature (up to 40 °C). These amylases showed higher specific activity and cold tolerance than those previously reported.

The mixed biomass was converted into either biocrude oil with a yield up to 40% via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or syngas with a yield up to 54% yield via catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG). Adding granular activated carbon (GAC) in the MABB enhanced the removal of estrogenic hormones (+ 7.2%), cytotoxicity (+ 58%), and heavy metals (+ 10.5%).

Seventeen samples of raw turkey meat from the Czech Republic (n = 4), Hungary (n = 2), Poland (n = 6) and Germany (n = 5) were cultured in peptone water at 37 °C overnight and the enriched cultures were tested for the presence of mcr-1-5 genes. PCR-positive enriched cultures were inoculated onto selective agar with colistin (3.5 mg/L). A minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin was determined by using the broth microdilution method in PCR-positive isolates. In addition, a macrorestriction analysis was performed using XbaI endonuclease. Of 17 meat samples, 12 samples from Poland (6/6), Germany (3/5) and the Czech Republic (3/4) proved positive for the presence of the mcr-1 gene. Forty-two isolates carrying the mcr-1 gene were obtained: Escherichia coli (n = 39) revealing 32 distinct XbaI profiles and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3) with 2 distinct XbaI profiles. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the mcr-1 positive isolates was as follows: 4 mg/L (n = 28), 8 mg/L (n = 12), 32 mg/L (n = 1) and 64 mg/L (n = 1). The high prevalence (70.6%; 12/17 samples) of mcr-1-mediated colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae found in the turkey meat samples analysed in this study, builds on previously published evidence that poultry, and their products, represent a substantial risk for the dissemination of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in Europe.",Clinical isolates of Escherichia coli are resistant both to antibiotics and organotin compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001763,Folia microbiologica,2019 04 19,"Antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli are common causative agents of human urinary tract infections. Organotin compounds (OTCs) are man-made chemicals that may affect the renal function of exposed humans and rodents. OTCs are widely recognized as bactericides. However, many environmental and a few clinically relevant bacteria have been found resistant to high concentrations of some OTCs. We examined the susceptibility from 47 E. coli clinical isolates to 12 antibiotics and 5 OTCs. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by the fully automated Sensititre™ ARIS™ 2X system, and E. coli strains were classified as resistant, intermediate resistant, or sensitive, according to the M07-A10 and M100-S26 criteria from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. All 47 E. coli strains were susceptible to amikacin but resistant to imipenem and intermediate resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, and chloramphenicol. In addition, 26 strains were resistant and 21 intermediate resistant to aztreonam, 24 strains were resistant and 23 intermediate resistant to ceftazidime, 44 strains were intermediate resistant and 3 sensitive to cephalothin, and 43 strains were intermediate resistant and 4 sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Approximately half of the strains were susceptible to cefepime, cefotaxime, and gentamicin. E. coli strains were also found resistant to triphenyltin, tributyltin, dibutyltin, trimethyltin, or dimethyltin at final concentration between 10 μmol/L and 1 mmol/L, during 72-h in vitro culture. However, higher in vitro growth inhibition was induced by these OTCs in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, which suggests that efflux pumps contribute to making antibiotic-resistant E. coli also resistant to OTCs.",The role of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001762,Folia microbiologica,2019 04 19,"The symbiotic relationship between intestinal microbiota and the host is a major mechanism of prevention against the development of chronic and metabolic diseases.

The aim of this study was to compare recurrence rate after cabergoline withdrawal in premenopausal vs. postmenopausal women with microprolactinoma. Sixty-two women with microprolactinoma treated with cabergoline for at least 1 year and followed for 2 years after drug withdrawal were retrospectively selected. Patients were divided into two groups: 48 patients stopped cabergoline before menopause (""PRE"" group), while 14 after menopause (""POST"" group). Recurrence was defined by prolactin levels above normal, confirmed on two occasions. Overall, 39/62 women relapsed. Patients who relapsed apparently had higher prolactin before withdrawal (median 216.2, range 21.2-464.3 mIU/L) compared with those in long-term remission (94.3, 29.7-402.8 mIU/L; p < 0.05), and the risk of recurrence seemed lower in POST women (4/14, 29%) than in PRE ones (35/48, 73%, p < 0.005, OR 0.149, 95% CI 0.040-0.558). However, none of the factors (prolactin before withdrawal, menopausal status, treatment duration, complete adenoma regression) showed a correlation with recurrence risk in multivariate analysis. The best strategy able to optimize CBG treatment and withdrawal's outcomes is still to be defined in microprolactinomas. Postmenopausal status cannot reliably predict long-term remission, and follow-up is needed also in women of this age.","Safety assessment of the pharmacological excipient, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE), using in vitro and in vivo systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001735,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",2019 04 19,"Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE) is widely used as a solubilizer in cosmetics as well as in oral, topical, transdermal and injectable pharmaceutical formulations.

Given reforms in China focusing on the hospital sector, it has been demonstrated that efficiency and productivity are important in meeting the overall objective of meeting more accessibility to hospital care for the population. Measuring an aggregate directional distance function is in itself a non-parametric approach, we report on the decomposition of hospital performance and found that between 2009 and 2010, technical inefficiency (using resources inefficiently) dominated overall inefficiency but beyond 2011-2016, mix inefficiency (misallocation of resources) was higher. Furthermore, an additive total factor productivity (TFP) indicator is proposed to capture contributions of individual provincial (or group) hospital performance to the total productivity gain. We also report that mix inefficiency had growth throughout this time period indicating a catching up in the correct mix of inputs. This finding is worth following as hospital reform in China also focuses on utilizing the right labor and capital mix in producing efficient care.",Metformin enhances gefitinib efficacy by interfering with interactions between tumor-associated macrophages and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001733,Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),2019 04 19,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in drug resistance in many tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Yet models of post-test counselling support are poorly defined. Moreover, it is unclear how these might be best delivered. In this project, a genetic counsellor and clinical psychologist developed standalone group sessions using collective narrative practices for individuals post-predictive testing. Here we present an evaluation of the experiences of one group of six people who have tested mutation positive for HD and remain pre-symptomatic. Two partners also attended the session. Observations, evaluation forms and telephone interviews were used in data collection. Interview data was available from five mutation-positive individuals and one partner. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic framework approach. Responses were overwhelmingly positive, emphasising the importance of a specifically arranged time and space to share experiences in a structured way. This was typically the first time participants had spoken openly with someone in their situation. Narrative facilitation of discussion encouraged participants to re-discover their strengths and resiliences, with similar experiences being discovered through connections with others. The evaluation was successful in implementing group narrative interventions as part of the predictive test counselling support for Huntington's disease.

Minority carrier lifetime of the samples was measured by Sinton WCT-120. Field-effect passivation and chemical passivation were evaluated by fixed oxide charge (Qf) and interface defect density (Dit), respectively, using capacitance-voltage measurement. The results show that O2 annealing gives a high Qf of - 3.9 × 1012 cm-2, whereas FG annealing leads to excellent Si interface hydrogenation with a low Dit of 3.7 × 1011 eV-1 cm-2. Based on the consideration of the best field-effect passivation brought by oxygen annealing and the best chemical passivation brought by forming gas, the two-step annealing process was optimized. It is verified that the Al2O3 film annealed sequentially in oxygen and then in forming gas exhibits a high Qf (2.4 × 1012 cm-2) and a low Dit (3.1 × 1011 eV-1 cm-2), yielding the best minority carrier lifetime of 1097 μs. The SiNx/Al2O3 passivation stack with two-step annealing has a lifetime of 2072 μs, close to the intrinsic lifetime limit. Finally, the passivated emitter and rear cell conversion efficiency was improved from 21.61% by using an industry annealing process to 21.97% by using the two-step annealing process.","Ankle Fracture Detection Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network Ensemble Implemented with a Small Sample, De Novo Training, and Multiview Incorporation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001713,Journal of digital imaging,2019 04 19,"To determine whether we could train convolutional neural network (CNN) models de novo with a small dataset, a total of 596 normal and abnormal ankle cases were collected and processed.

Training was performed using single radiographic views. Measured output metrics were accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity. Model outputs were evaluated using both one and three radiographic views. Ensembles were created from a combination of CNNs after training. A voting method was implemented to consolidate the output from the three views and model ensemble. For single radiographic views, the ensemble of all 5 models produced the best accuracy at 76%. When all three views for a single case were utilized, the ensemble of all models resulted in the best output metrics with an accuracy of 81%.

Flowering is a key event in the life cycle of plants. Flowering time shows an extensive variation from different Pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) cultivars. However, the regulation mechanism of flowering in Pak-choi remains rarely known. In this study, a systematic identification and functional analysis of a Pak-choi MADS Affecting Flowering (MAF) gene, BcMAF2, was carried out. BcMAF2 encoded a protein containing a conserved MADS-box domain, which was localized in the nucleus. QPCR analysis indicated that the expression of BcMAF2 was higher in the leaves and flowers. Overexpression of BcMAF2 in Arabidopsis showed that BcMAF2 repressed flowering, which was further confirmed by silencing endogenous BcMAF2 in Pak-choi. In addition, Tempranillo 1 (TEM1) expression was up-regulated and MAF2 expression was down-regulated in the BcMAF2-overexpressing Arabidopsis. The expression of BcMAF2 and BcTEM1 was down-regulated in BcMAF2-silencing Pak-choi plants. The yeast one-hybrid, dual luciferase and qPCR results revealed that BcMAF2 protein could directly bind to BcTEM1 promoter and activate its expression, which was not reported in Arabidopsis. Meanwhile, a self-inhibition was found in BcMAF2. Taken together, this work suggested that BcMAF2 could repress flowering by directly activating BcTEM1.",Intervention Effects of Motivation Interviewing Chinese Modified on the Mental Health of College Students with Exercise Dependence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001711,The Psychiatric quarterly,2019 05 20,"Exercise dependence is a psychological problem that cannot be ignored and is positively related to anxiety and depression of college students.

After three weeks of motivation interviewing Chinese modified, differences in state anxiety, depression, self-satisfaction, negative emotion, energy, and positive emotion in the intervention and control groups before and after the intervention appear to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). Motivation interviewing Chinese modified can improve the mental health level of college students with exercise dependence. Hence, motivation interviewing Chinese modified is good for the treatment of addiction behaviors and provides a reliable intervention method for exercise dependence.",Dual-wavelength erbium-doped fluoride fiber laser.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001710,Lasers in medical science,2019 04 19,"The laser source with 3 μm/2 μm output wavelength has many application prospects in clinical medicine, photoelectric countermeasure, and scientific research measurement.

The objective of this study is to compare individual-factor-based (IFB) models and multi-factor-based (MFB) models as well as examine the impacts of each factor on future urban scenarios. We quantified the contribution of driving factors using a generalized additive model (GAM), and calibrated six IFB-DE-CA models and fifteen MFB-DE-CA models using a differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The six IFB-DE-CA models and five MFB-DE-CA models were selected to simulate the 2005-2015 urban expansion of Hangzhou, China, and all IFB-DE-CA models were applied to project future urban scenarios out to the year 2030. Our results show that terrain (DEM) and population density (POP) are the two most influential factors affecting urban expansion of Hangzhou, indicating the dominance of biophysical and demographic drivers. All DE-CA models produced defensible simulations for 2015, with overall accuracy exceeding 89%. The IFB-DE-CA models based on DEM and POP outperformed some MFB-DE-CA models, suggesting that multiple factors are not necessarily more effective than a single factor in simulating present urban patterns. The future scenarios produced by the IFB-DE-CA models are substantially shaped by the corresponding factors. These scenarios can inform urban modelers and policy-makers as to how Hangzhou city will evolve if the corresponding factors are individually focused. This study improves our understanding of the effects of driving factors on urban expansion and future scenarios when incorporating the factors separately.",The interrelationship between concepts about agency and students' use of teachable-agent learning technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001708,Cognitive research: principles and implications,2019 05 05,"To successfully interact with software agents, people must call upon basic concepts about goals and intentionality and strategically deploy these concepts in a range of circumstances where specific entailments may or may not apply. We hypothesize that people who can effectively deploy agency concepts in new situations will be more effective in interactions with software agents. Further, we posit that interacting with a software agent can itself refine a person's deployment of agency concepts. We investigated this reciprocal relationship in one particularly important context: the classroom. In three experiments we examined connections between middle school students' concepts about agency and their success learning from a teachable-agent-based computer system called ""Betty's Brain"". We found that the students who made more intentional behavioral predictions about humans learned more effectively from the system. We also found that students who used the Betty's Brain system distinguished human behavior from machine behavior more strongly than students who did not. We conclude that the ability to effectively deploy agency concepts both supports, and is refined by, interactions with software agents.",Gene expression analysis of follicular cells revealed inflammation as a potential IVF failure cause.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001707,Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,2019 04 19,Hormonal stimulation prior to IVF influences the ovarian environment and therefore impacts oocytes and subsequent embryo quality. Not every patient has the same response to the same treatment and many fail for unknown reasons. Knowing why a cycle has failed and how the follicles were affected would allow clinicians to adapt the treatment accordingly and improve success rate. This study examines the hypothesis that transcriptomic analysis of follicular cells from failed IVF cycles reveals potential reasons for failure and provides new information on the physiological mechanisms related to IVF failure.

In the present study, we investigated the roles of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in high temperature (HT) and drought-induced inhibition of rice seed germination. HT and drought stress caused ABA accumulation in seeds and inhibited seed germination and seedling establishment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that HT and drought stress induced the expression of OsNCED3, a key gene in ABA synthesis in rice seeds. In addition, ROS (O2•- and H2O2) and malondialdehyde contents were increased in germinating seeds under HT and drought stress. Moreover, we adopted the non-invasive micro-test technique to detect H2O2 and Ca2+ fluxes at the site of coleoptile emergence. HT and drought stress resulted in a H2O2 efflux, but only drought stress significantly induced Ca2+ influx. Antioxidant enzyme assays revealed that superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity were reduced by HT and drought stress, consistent with the expression of OsCu/ZnSOD, OsCATc, and OsAPX2 during seed germination. Altogether, these results suggest that ABA and ROS accumulation under HT and drought conditions can inhibit rice seed germination and growth.",Evaluation of giant cell tumors by diffusion weighted imaging-fractional ADC analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001688,Skeletal radiology,2019 04 19,"A single ADC value is used in clinical practice on multi b-value acquisitions.

In the OR of the future, not only will data enrichment and information integration play a role, but so will the incorporation of high-tech medical devices. Their use and the information they generate are simplified, while at the same time, further clinical data are optimized before, during, and after the surgical procedure. Specially designed intuitive user interfaces, automated workflows, and advanced imaging techniques allow the full potential of diagnostic, surgical, and postoperative patient data to be exploited. New surgical planning technology helps ENT surgeons to more easily evaluate complex anatomical structures and more accurately and quickly diagnose conditions. Based on an adaptable anatomical software model, a multitude of anatomical structures can be identified and segmented as objects. The high accuracy and consistency of identification of these objects make segmentation an integral part of precise treatment planning. With modern planning software, in 3D patient images, tumors and structures at risk can be accurately contoured, trajectories planned, and CT and MR images fused and subsequently easily accessed in the OR for further use. This serves as a guide during surgery and ultimately results in improved patient safety and more efficient routine clinical workflows.",Predicting the timing of ecological phenomena using dates of species occurrence records: a methodological approach and test case with mushrooms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001681,International journal of biometeorology,2019 04 19,"Spatiotemporal predictions of ecological phenomena are highly useful and significant in scientific and socio-economic applications. However, the inadequate availability of ecological time-series data often impedes the development of statistical predictions. On the other hand, considerable amounts of temporally discrete biological records (commonly known as 'species occurrence records') are being stored in public databases, and often include the location and date of the observation. In this paper, we describe an approach to develop spatiotemporal predictions based on the dates and locations found in species occurrence records. The approach is based on 'time-series classification', a field of machine learning, and consists of applying a machine-learning algorithm to classify between time series representing the environmental variation that precedes the occurrence records and time series representing the full range of environmental variation that is available in the location of the records. We exemplify the application of the approach for predicting the timing of emergence of fruiting bodies of two mushroom species (Boletus edulis and Macrolepiota procera) in Europe, from 2009 to 2015. Predictions made from this approach were superior to those provided by a 'null' model representing the average seasonality of the species. Given the increased availability and information contained in species occurrence records, particularly those supplemented with photographs, the range of environmental events that could be possible to predict using this approach is vast."

A data set of patients with newly diagnosed NKTCL who were diagnosed at 31 institutes in Japan between 2000 and 2013 was used for analysis. The patients' fitness for steroid, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide (SMILE) chemotherapy was assessed using the major inclusion criteria of the SMILE phase 2 study.

The plant has been used since ancient times in ayurvedic traditional medicines for the treatment of hypertension, glaucoma, asthma, congestive heart failures, obesity, and cancer. Use of endophytic microorganisms presents a special interest for the development of value-added bioactive compounds through agriculture. Limited investigations have been undertaken on in planta enhancement of forskolin content using endophytic fungus in sustainable agriculture. Here we report specific roles of three fungal endophytes, Fusarium redolens (RF1), Phialemoniopsis cornearis (SF1), and Macrophomina pseudophaseolina (SF2), functionally acting as plant probiotic fungus, regulating secondary metabolite (forskolin) biosynthesis in C. forskohlii. The root endophyte, RF1, and shoot endophytes, SF1 and SF2, were found to enhance forskolin content by 52 to 88% in pot and 60 to 84% in field experiments as compared to uninoculated control plants. The three endophytes also enhanced total biomass owing to plant growth promoting properties. The expression of diterpene synthases (CfTPSs) like CfTPS1, CfTPS2, CfTPS3, and CfTPS4 were significantly upregulated in endophyte-treated C. forskohlii plants. Elevated expression of key diterpene synthases (CfTPS2) in the forskolin biosynthesis pathway, exclusively present in the root cork of C. forskohlii, was observed following SF2 endophyte treatment. Furthermore, endophyte treatments conferred a variety of antagonistic activity against nematode galls (80%) and plant pathogens like Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotricum gloeosporioides, and Sclerotium rolfsii. RF1 and SF1 fungal endophytes showed positive for IAA production; however, SF1 also indicated phosphate solubilization activity. Overall, the qualitative and quantitative improvement of in planta forskolin enhancement represents an area of high commercial interest, and hence, our work focused on novel insights for the application of three fungal endophytes for in planta enhancement of forskolin content for C. forskohlii cultivation by a sustainable approach."

A Mtb gene, Rv1075c, was annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein. We have identified that Rv1075c amino acid sequence shares similarities to other bacterial lipase/esterases. With the overexpressed and purified rRv1075c protein, we demonstrated that it had an esterase activity, and preferred short-chain fatty acids, with the highest activity on acetate. Its activity was the highest at 45 °C and pH=9. Site-direct mutagenesis revealed its activity triad as Ser80, Asp244, and His247. We further determined that rRv1075c hydrolyzed triacetin and tributyrin, and the Rv1075c protein was mainly distributed in cell wall and cell membrane of Mtb. Its transcriptional expression was induced at pH=4.5, a condition mimicking the acidic phagosome of macrophage. The mutation of Rv1075c led to significantly reduced bacterial growth in THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear derived macrophages, and attenuated Mtb infection in mice (with ~7-fold bacterial load reduction in mouse lungs). Our data suggest that Rv1075c is likely involved in ester and fatty acid metabolism to help Mtb utilize carbon and energy while Mtb stays inside of host cells.","Circulating obesity-driven biomarkers are associated with risk of clear cell renal cell carcinoma: a two-stage, case-control study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001636,Carcinogenesis,2019 04 19,"Obesity is one of modifiable risk factors for clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC). We aim to identify the association between obesity-driven biomarkers and ccRCC risk. This is a retrospective, two-phases, case-control study involving 682 cases and 733 controls. Obesity-driven biomarkers (GIP, C-peptide, Insulin, Resistin, Adipsin, PYY, PPY, IL-6, TNF-α, PAI1, MCP1, Lipocalin2, Leptin, Adiponectin) were measured using the Milliplex method. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between biomarkers and ccRCC risk. Results revealed GIP, C-peptide, IL6, and TNF-α levels were consistently distinct between cases and controls. These markers were significantly associated with ccRCC risk in both phases (except C-peptide). In the combined population, compared to individuals with low levels of the biomarkers, individuals with high level of GIP (OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.40-0.67) had lower risk, whereas individuals with high levels of C-peptide (OR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15-1.87), IL-6 (OR=2.20, 95% CI: 1.50-3.22), TNF-α (OR=1.90, 95% CI: 1.49-2.43) had significantly higher risk. Stratified analysis showed consistent associations with ccRCC risk in most subgroups (P <0.05). The risk score based on the IL-6, TNF-α and GIP was positively associated with ccRCC risk in a dose-response manner (P for trend=2.18E-13). Data from TCGA indicates that insulin signaling, IL-6 signaling and TNF-α signaling were enhanced in tumors. Collectively, our study demonstrates the integrative effect of insulin resistance and inflammation in ccRCC development, which may elucidate the basis of association between obesity and carcinogenesis. Further confirmation in prospective cohort studies are warranted for clinical applications in prevention and precision medicine of ccRCC.",GalaxyRefine2: simultaneous refinement of inaccurate local regions and overall protein structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001635,Nucleic acids research,2019 04 19,"The 3D structure of a protein can be predicted from its amino acid sequence with high accuracy for a large fraction of cases because of the availability of large quantities of experimental data and the advance of computational algorithms. Recently, deep learning methods exploiting the coevolution information obtained by comparing related protein sequences have been successfully used to generate highly accurate model structures even in the absence of template structure information. However, structures predicted based on either template structures or related sequences require further improvement in regions for which information is missing. Refining a predicted protein structure with insufficient information on certain regions is critical because these regions may be connected to functional specificity that is not conserved among related proteins. The GalaxyRefine2 web server, freely available via http://galaxy.seoklab.org/refine2, is an upgraded version of the GalaxyRefine protein structure refinement server and reflects recent developments successfully tested through CASP blind prediction experiments. This method adopts an iterative optimization approach involving various structure move sets to refine both local and global structures. The estimation of local error and hybridization of available homolog structures are also employed for effective conformation search.","The capability of L-carnitine-mediated antioxidant on cock during aging: evidence for the improved semen quality and enhanced testicular expressions of GnRH1, GnRHR, and melatonin receptors MT 1/2.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001634,Poultry science,2019 04 19,"Precise natural anti-oxidative compounds have facilitated the research of infertile gametes and the development of novel bio-therapeutics, especially the molecules that are based on the reduction of oxidative stress, such as L-carnitine (LC). In addition to, the defect in the functioning of sperm mitochondrial and the decreasing seminal antioxidant ability due to aging, its essential role in permitting the mitochondrial import and oxidation of long chain fatty acids is worthy. Therefore, current study was designed to investigate the effects of dietary LC on semen quality, seminal antioxidant activity, and their implications for the fertility in aged cocks for 12 wk. Supplementation of the feed with two different doses of LC (50 and 150 mg/kg body weight/day) for 12 wk showed significantly increased in the reproductive activity of cock, in comparison to the control group. Seminal analysis showed that supplementation of LC significantly increased (P < 0.05) the sperm motility, concentration, livability, semen quality factor, seminal malondialdehyde concentration, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. In addition, addition of LC significantly increased (P < 0.05) the plasma concentration of testosterone and prostaglandin E2 but posed no significant effect on the concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone. Furthermore, the findings of artificial insemination showed significant increased (P < 0.05) in the percentage of fertility in LC groups, while the percentage hatchability and mortality remained unchanged. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that LC significantly increased (P < 0.05) the testicular immunopositivity of MT1 and MT2. Moreover, the administration of LC to the aged cocks enhanced (P < 0.05) GnRH1 and GnRHR mRNA levels when compared with untreated cocks. The results of the present study suggest that LC treatment of aged cocks increases the seminal antioxidant enzymes and sexual hormones levels, which may improve the semen quality by increasing the expression of GnRH1 and melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) activities. Collectively, LC could be a suitable feed supplementation to increase reproductive activities through enhancing semen quality in aging cocks.",Antibody persistence to two Virus-Like Particle norovirus vaccine candidate formulations in healthy adults: one-year follow-up with memory probe vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001633,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 04 19,We previously reported the tolerability and immunogenicity one month after intramuscular administration of two bivalent norovirus virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate formulations in adults.

However, the function and precise mechanism of the vast majority of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) occurrence and progression have not been clearly elucidated. In the current study, we identified and further investigated hsa_circ_0002453 (circRAD18) by analyzing our previous microarray profiling. Expression of circRAD18 was found significantly up-regulated in TNBC compared with normal mammary tissues and cell lines. CircRAD18 was positively correlated with T stage, clinical stage and pathological grade and was an independent risk factor for TNBC patients. We performed proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, apoptosis and mouse xenograft assays to verified the functions of circRAD18. Knockdown of circRAD18 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration, promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth in functional and xenograft experiments. Though luciferase reporter assays, we confirmed circRAD18 acts as a sponge of miR-208a and miR-3164 and promotes TNBC progression through up-regulating IGF1 and FGF2 expression. Altogether, our research revealed the pivotal role of circRAD18-miR-208a/3164-IGF1/FGF2 axis in TNBC tumorigenesis and metastasis though the mechanism of competing endogenous RNAs. Thus, circRAD18 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential target for TNBC treatment in the future."

Consequently, this results in a supervised training period until APPs develop the necessary competencies to practice more autonomously. Educational programs that support specialty competency development may facilitate the transition of APPs into clinical practice, allowing them to be credentialed to perform essential procedures as quickly as possible. The goal of this boot camp was to provide training for APPs in common critical care, high-risk procedures, and to provide leadership development for high-risk cases to expedite their orientation process.

Perlapine has been reported to activate DREADDs at nanomolar concentrations but is not approved for use in humans by the Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency, limiting its translational potential. Here, we report that the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine, widely available in various formulations, is a potent agonist of the human M4 muscarinic receptor-based DREADD, facilitating clinical translation of chemogenetics to treat central nervous system diseases.","Urine salts elucidate Early Neolithic animal management at Aşıklı Höyük, Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001590,Science advances,2019 04 21,"The process of sheep and goat (caprine) domestication began by 9000 to 8000 BCE in Southwest Asia.

We hypothesized that αII- and βII-spectrin subunits fulfill this role, and investigated their structural organization in rodent HCs. Using super-resolution fluorescence imaging, we found that spectrin formed ring-like structures around the base of stereocilia rootlets. These spectrin rings were associated with the hearing ability of mice. Further, HC-specific, βII-spectrin knockout mice displayed profound deafness.

We find that variations of the ocean CO2 uptake are predictable up to 2 years in advance globally, albeit there is evidence for a higher predictive skill up to 5 years regionally. We further suggest that while temperature variations largely determine shorter-term (<3 years) predictability, nonthermal drivers are responsible for longer-term (>3 years) predictability, especially at high latitudes.",Physical and geometric determinants of transport in fetoplacental microvascular networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001587,Science advances,2019 04 21,"Across mammalian species, solute exchange takes place in complex microvascular networks.

However, applying distance correlation to imaging genetic studies often needs multiple testing correction due to the large number of multiple inferences. As a result, the sensitivity of its detection may be low. We propose a new model, distance canonical correlation analysis (DCCA), which overcomes this problem by searching a combination of features with the highest distance correlation. This is achieved by constructing a distance kernel function followed by solving a subsequent optimization problem. The ability to detect both linear and nonlinear associations makes DCCA suitable for analyzing complex multimodal and imaging-genetic associations. When applied to a brain imaging-genetic study from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), DCCA detected several mental disorder-related gene pathways and brain networks. Experiments on brain connectivity found that the default mode network had strong nonlinear connections with other brain networks. When applied to the study of age effects, DCCA revealed that the connections of brain networks were relatively weak in younger groups but became stronger at older age stages. It indicates that adolescence is a vital stage for brain development.

Recent evidence has shown the potential of VPA in the control of certain cancers, owed in part to its role in modulating epigenetic changes through the inhibition of histone deacetylases, affecting the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. The direct impact of VPA in cells of the immune system has only been explored recently. In this review, we discuss the effects of VPA in the suppression of some activation mechanisms in several immune cells that lead to an anti-inflammatory response. As expected, immune cells are not exempt from the effect of VPA, as it also affects the expression of genes of the cell cycle and apoptosis through epigenetic modifications. In addition to inhibiting histone deacetylases, VPA promotes RNA interference, activates histone methyltransferases, or represses the activation of transcription factors. However, during the infectious process, the effectiveness of VPA is subject to the biological nature of the pathogen and the associated immune response; this is because VPA can promote the control or the progression of the infection. Due to its various effects, VPA is a promising alternative for the control of autoimmune diseases and hypersensitivity and needs to be further explored.",Immunobiotics Beneficially Modulate TLR4 Signaling Triggered by Lipopolysaccharide and Reduce Hepatic Steatosis In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001563,Journal of immunology research,2019 04 21,"Hepatic inflammation and injury may result from the translocation of pathological bacteria and their proinflammatory mediators. Probiotics attenuate hepatic diseases related to inflammation by exhibiting immunoregulatory effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate lipid reduction and immunoregulatory potentials of probiotic bacteria in vitro. HepG2 cells treated with total cellular fluid (TCF) of LABs reduced lipid accumulation. Moreover, cells responded to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by producing higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and TNF-α. TCF of LABs treatment showed remarkably diminished levels of the expression of these cytokines via modulation of the expression of TLR-negative regulators, as well as MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, heat-killed LABs were able to diminish TGF-β, IL-1β, and IL-6 and to increase IL-10 and TLR4 levels in THP-1 cells. LABs also decreased the protein level of TNF-α. These results demonstrated that immunobiotics exhibit potent immunoregulatory activity and may be used as effective therapeutic agents to alleviate inflammatory response.","Effects of Ginger (Zingiber officinale, Roscoe) Essential Oil on Growth and Laying Performances, Serum Metabolites, and Egg Yolk Antioxidant and Cholesterol Status in Laying Japanese Quail.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001562,Journal of veterinary medicine,2019 04 21,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of ginger (Zingiber officinale, Rosc.) essential oil on growth and laying performances, egg yolk antioxidant and cholesterol status, and serum metabolites in Japanese quail. Eighty 3-week-old Japanese quails weighing between 120 and 130 g were equally and randomly assigned to four groups receiving daily and orally, respectively, 100 µl/kg body weight (bw) distilled water and 50, 100, and 150 µl/kg bw of ginger rhizomes essential oil, respectively. The entire feeding trial for all groups lasted for 9 weeks and the Z. officinale essential oil effects were studied on growth and laying performances, serum metabolites, and egg yolk antioxidant and cholesterol status. Results revealed that feed intake, live and body weights gain, feed conversion ratio, egg production, and weekly mass of eggs were not significantly (P>0.05) influenced by oral administration of ginger rhizomes essential oil. Unlike the abdominal fat weight which decreased significantly (p<0.05) in all treated quails, the oral administration of ginger rhizomes essential oil had no significant effects (p> 0.05) on liver, intestine, heart, and gizzard relative weights as compared to the control. Egg weight markedly (P<0.05) increased in Japanese quails treated with ginger rhizomes essential oil whatever the dose with reference to the control. The serum content in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and transaminases (AST and ALT) decreased significantly (P<0.05) with 100 and 150 µl/kg bw of ginger rhizomes essential oil compared to control group. In conclusion, oral administration of 100 to 150 µl/kg bw of ginger rhizomes essential oil to laying Japanese quails positively influences egg weight and decreased serum and egg cholesterols without any adverse effect on feed intake and body weight gain.",A New Way for Beta Cell Neogenesis: Transdifferentiation from Alpha Cells Induced by Glucagon-Like Peptide 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001561,Journal of diabetes research,2019 04 21,"Recent studies showed that alpha cells, especially immature cells and proalpha cells, might be the precursors of beta cells. Exposure to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) can ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice and restore the beta cell mass. In the present study, we adopted single high-dose (60 mg/kg, i.p.) streptozotocin (STZ) to model diabetes mellitus (DM) and randomly assigned short-tail (SD) rats to a normal group, a diabetic group, GLP1 groups (50 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, and 200 μg/kg), a GLP1 (200 μg/kg) with exendin (9-39) group, and a GLP1 with LY294002 group. We found that the pancreatic insulin-glucagon-positive cell populations increased according to the increase in GLP1 exposure. By contrast, no insulin-amylase-positive cell populations or insulin/pan-cytokeratin cells were observed in the pancreatic sections. The GLP1 receptor antagonist exendin (9-39) and the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) family inhibitor LY294002 not only suppressed protein kinase B (Akt), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), forkhead box O 1 (FoxO1), and mast cell function-associated antigen A (MafA) mRNA expression but also increased MAFB expression. We concluded that treatment with GLP1 might result in beta cell neogenesis by promoting the transdifferentiation of alpha cells but not by pancreatic acinar cells, ductal cells, or the self-replication of beta cells. The regulation on the GLP1 receptor and its downstream transcription factor PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway, which causes increased pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) and MafA mRNA expression but causes decreased MAFB expression, may be the mechanism involved in this process.",Intestinal Perforation in ACTH-Dependent Cushing's Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001560,BioMed research international,2019 04 21,"Previous studies have linked systemic glucocorticoid use with intestinal perforation. However, the association between intestinal perforation and endogenous hypercortisolism has not been well described, with only 14 previously published case reports. In this study, we investigated if intestinal perforation occurred more frequently in patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome and in those with a greater than 10-fold elevation of 24-hour urinary free cortisol level. Of 110 patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome followed in two clinics in Canada, six cases with intestinal perforation were identified over 15 years. Age of patients ranged from 52 to 72, five females and one male, four with Cushing's disease and two with ectopic ACTH production, one from a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and one from medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Five had diverticular perforation and one had intestinal perforation from a stercoral ulcer. All cases had their lower intestinal perforation when the cortisol production was high, and one patient had diverticular perforation 15 months prior to the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. As in previously reported cases, most had hypokalemia and abdominal pain with minimal or no peritoneal symptoms and this occurred during the active phase of Cushing's syndrome. Whereas all previously reported cases occurred in patients with 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels greater than 10-fold the upper limit of normal when measured and 11 of 14 patients had ectopic ACTH production, only one of our patients had this degree of hypercortisolism and four of our six patients had Cushing's disease. Similar to exogenous steroid use, patients with endogenous hypercortisolism also have a higher risk of intestinal, in particular diverticular, perforation and should be monitored closely for its occurrence with a low threshold for investigation and surgical intervention. Elective colonoscopy probably should be deferred until Cushing's syndrome is under control.","Mutant Lines of Spring Wheat with Increased Iron, Zinc, and Micronutrients in Grains and Enhanced Bioavailability for Human Health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001559,BioMed research international,2019 04 21,"Deficiency of metals, primarily Fe and Zn, affects over half of the world's population. Human diets dominated by cereal products cause micronutrient malnutrition, which is common in many developing countries where populations depend heavily on staple grain crops such as wheat, maize, and rice. Biofortification is one of the most effective approaches to alleviate malnutrition. Genetically stable mutant spring wheat lines (M7 generation) produced via 100 or 200 Gy gamma treatments to broaden genetic variation for grain nutrients were analyzed for nutritionally important minerals (Ca, Fe, and Zn), their bioavailability, and grain protein content (GPC). Variation was 172.3-883.0 mg/kg for Ca, 40.9-89.0 mg/kg for Fe, and 22.2-89.6 mg/kg for Zn. In mutant lines, among the investigated minerals, the highest increases in concentrations were observed in Fe, Zn, and Ca when compared to the parental cultivar Zhenis. Some mutant lines, mostly in the 100 Gy-derived germplasm, had more than two-fold higher Fe, Zn, and Ca concentrations, lower phytic acid concentration (1.4-2.1-fold), and 6.5-7% higher grain protein content compared to the parent. Variation was detected for the molar ratios of Ca:Phy, Phy:Fe, and Phy:Zn (1.27-10.41, 1.40-5.32, and 1.78-11.78, respectively). The results of this study show how genetic variation generated through radiation can be useful to achieve nutrient biofortification of crops to overcome human malnutrition."

This concept is a precondition for animal welfare as well as reducing antibiotic usage in farm animals. The demand for fighting bacterial antimicrobial resistance in humans, animals, and in the environment is one driving force for the development of innovative technical solutions to improve husbandry. Maintenance of a good health status in pigs depends on early detection of a disturbance in homeostasis in critical phases of life. This can be measured by non-specific biomarkers as acute phase proteins. In this project, husbandry conditions and health status in nursery pigs were monitored in an autumn and winter nursery period from weaning to the end of nursery in two compartments with 180 pigs each. It was investigated whether a slight modification in indoor climate achieved by a new ammonia sensory technology coupled with the electronic control unit of the forced ventilation system ensuring ammonia levels lower than 5 ± 3 ppm in one compartment led to a better health status in piglets in comparison to the control compartment. In the examined nursery periods in different seasons, ammonia concentrations in the experimental compartment were significantly lower than in the control compartment, thus proving the functionality and efficacy of the technical system. Production parameters as feed conversion rate and average daily weight gain were slightly improved in the experimental compartment without implementing other measures. Multifactorial analysis of variance resulted in a significant influence of season, daily quarter, and compartment on ammonia concentration. The challenge to preserve a high health status of piglets also during suboptimal outside climate in the transitional season was reflected by an increase in the acute-phase proteins haptoglobin (Hp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in autumn compared to winter. The seasonal influence on concentrations of CRP and Hp superimposed potential influences of the climate modification. New technological concepts to reduce noxious gases and dust in the animal environment as well as emissions, which in parallel guarantee optimal temperatures also during extreme weather conditions, can be evaluated by clinical data in combination with biomarkers.",Interventricular Differences in Action Potential Duration Restitution Contribute to Dissimilar Ventricular Rhythms in ex vivo Perfused Hearts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001543,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 04 21,"Background: Dissimilar ventricular rhythms refer to the occurrence of different ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the right and left ventricles or different rates of the same tachyarrhythmia in the two ventricles. Objective: We investigated the inducibility of dissimilar ventricular rhythms, their underlying mechanisms, and the impact of anti-arrhythmic drugs (lidocaine and amiodarone) on their occurrence. Methods: Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced with burst pacing in 28 Langendorff-perfused Sprague Dawley rat hearts (14 control, 8 lidocaine, 6 amiodarone) and bipolar electrograms recorded from the right and left ventricles. Fourteen (6 control, 4 lidocaine, 4 amiodarone) further hearts underwent optical mapping of transmembrane voltage to study interventricular electrophysiological differences and mechanisms of dissimilar rhythms. Results: In control hearts, dissimilar ventricular rhythms developed in 8/14 hearts (57%). In lidocaine treated hearts, there was a lower cycle length threshold for developing dissimilar rhythms, with 8/8 (100%) hearts developing dissimilar rhythms in comparison to 0/6 in the amiodarone group. Dissimilar ventricular tachycardia (VT) rates occurred at longer cycle lengths with lidocaine vs. control (57.1 ± 7.9 vs. 36.6 ± 8.4 ms, p < 0.001). The ratio of LV:RV VT rate was greater in the lidocaine group than control (1.91 ± 0.30 vs. 1.76 ± 0.36, p < 0.001). The gradient of the action potential duration (APD) restitution curve was shallower in the RV compared with LV (Control - LV: 0.12 ± 0.03 vs RV: 0.002 ± 0.03, p = 0.015), leading to LV-to-RV conduction block during VT. Conclusion: Interventricular differences in APD restitution properties likely contribute to the occurrence of dissimilar rhythms. Sodium channel blockade with lidocaine increases the likelihood of dissimilar ventricular rhythms.",Searching for a Common Thrombo-Inflammatory Basis in Patients With Deep Vein Thrombosis or Peripheral Artery Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001542,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 04 21,"Background: Inflammation and hypercoagulability play a pivotal role in venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis. Since venous thrombosis increases the risk of atherothrombotic events and vice versa, common mechanisms may be involved. Objectives: To elucidate the role of neutrophils and coagulation in the occurrence of atherothrombotic events in patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT or peripheral artery disease (PAD). Materials and Methods: We studied 115 patients from two cohorts (75 DVT, 40 PAD). From those with PAD, 20 patients had progressive disease; from those with DVT, 25 patients had a recurrent DVT and 25 suffered from post thrombotic syndrome (PTS); patients were age and sex matched to DVT and PAD patients without events. Markers of neutrophil recruitment (p-selectin) and activation [nucleosomes, human neutrophil elastase- α1anti-trypsin (HNE-AT)], an anti-inflammatory marker (Lipoxin A4) and a clotting activity marker (d-dimer), were measured with ELISA. Coagulation potential was analyzed by thrombin generation (CAT method). Results: Higher nucleosome levels were found in DVT patients [11.3 U/mL (7.4-17.7)] compared to PAD patients [7.1 U/mL (5.1-13.8)], lower HNE-AT levels were found in DVT patients [33.4 ng/mL (23.5-40.5)] in comparison to PAD patients [158 ng/mL (88.1-283)]. No difference in nucleosome levels was found between DVT patients with cardiovascular (CV) events [12.6 U/mL (8.2-16.1)], and PAD patients with CV events [6.9 U/mL (4.9-11.2)]. Lipoxin A4 levels appeared to be significantly lower in DVT [2.4 ng/mL (1.7-4.8)] vs. PAD [35.6 ng/mL (16.6-80.1)], with similar results in DVT patients with CV events vs. PAD patients with CV events. Thrombin generation showed higher ETP [160.4% (141.1-215.4)], and peak height [292.1% (177.9-330)] values in DVT patients. D-dimer levels were significantly lower in the DVT cohort [330 ng/mL (220-550)] compared to the PAD cohort [550 ng/mL (369-959)]. Conclusion: In DVT patients, neutrophil activity does not appear to be an important driver of CV events. Although neutrophil activity is more pronounced in PAD, its effect is partly dampened by Lipoxin A4. Moreover, no associations were found between NET products and coagulation activity, suggesting that neutrophil activation does not play a pivotal role in the risk of thrombosis in either DVT or PAD.","Three in a Box: Understanding Cardiomyocyte, Fibroblast, and Innate Immune Cell Interactions to Orchestrate Cardiac Repair Processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001541,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 04 21,"Following an insult by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, complex cellular, and molecular interactions determine a successful recovery or inadequate repair of damaged tissue. The efficiency of this process is particularly important in the heart, an organ characterized by very limited regenerative and repair capacity in higher adult vertebrates. Cardiac insult is characteristically associated with fibrosis and heart failure, as a result of cardiomyocyte death, myocardial degeneration, and adverse remodeling. Recent evidence implies that resident non-cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts but also macrophages -pillars of the innate immunity- form part of the inflammatory response and decisively affect the repair process following a cardiac insult. Multiple studies in model organisms (mouse, zebrafish) of various developmental stages (adult and neonatal) combined with genetically engineered cell plasticity and differentiation intervention protocols -mainly targeting cardiac fibroblasts or progenitor cells-reveal particular roles of resident and recruited innate immune cells and their secretome in the coordination of cardiac repair. The interplay of innate immune cells with cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is emerging as a crucial platform to help our understanding and, importantly, to allow the development of effective interventions sufficient to minimize cardiac damage and dysfunction after injury.",Telomerase Deficiency Predisposes to Heart Failure and Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001540,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 04 22,"Introduction: Elevated levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the development of numerous cardiovascular diseases. TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, has been shown to translocate to mitochondria to suppress ROS while promoting ATP production. Acute overexpression of TERT increases survival and decreases infarct size in a mouse model of myocardial infarct, while decreased telomerase activity predisposes to mitochondrial defects and heart failure. In the present study, we examined the role of TERT on cardiac structure and function under basal conditions and conditions of acute or prolonged stress in a novel rat model of TERT deficiency. Methods: Cardiac structure and function were evaluated via transthoracic echocardiogram. Langendorff preparations were used to test the effects of acute global ischemia reperfusion injury on cardiac function and infarction. Coronary flow and left ventricular pressure were measured during and after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Mitochondrial DNA integrity was measured by PCR and mitochondrial respiration was assessed in isolated mitochondria using an Oxygraph. Angiotensin II infusion was used as an established model of systemic stress. Results: No structural changes (echocardiogram) or coronary flow/left ventricle pressure (isolated hearts) were observed in TERT-/- rats at baseline; however, after I/R, coronary flow was significantly reduced in TERT-/- compared to wild type (WT) rats, while diastolic Left Ventricle Pressure was significantly elevated (n = 6 in each group; p < 0.05) in the TERT-/-. Interestingly, infarct size was less in TERT-/- rats compared to WT rats, while mitochondrial respiratory control index decreased and mitochondrial DNA lesions increased in TERT-/- compared to WT. Angiotensin II treatment did not alter cardiac structure or function; however, it augmented the infarct size significantly more in TERT-/- compared to the WT. Conclusion: Absence of TERT activity increases susceptibility to stress like cardiac injury. These results suggest a critical role of telomerase in chronic heart disease.",The Effect of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin on Bacterial Growth: A Dual-Edged Sword.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001539,"Kidney diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 21,"Hypererythropoietinemia is associated with common diseases like non-uremic anaemia where infection burden is high.

Such droplet organelles can be reproduced and studied in vitro by using coacervates and have some remarkable features, including regulated assembly, differential partitioning of macromolecules, permeability to small molecules, and a uniquely crowded environment. Here, we review the main principles of biochemical organization in model membraneless compartments. We focus on some promising in vitro coacervate model systems that aptly mimic part of the compartmentalized cellular environment. We address the physicochemical characteristics of these liquid phase separated compartments, and their impact on biomolecular chemistry and assembly.

This is particularly true in Huntington's disease (HD), where in contrast with other disorders, the cause is monogenic. Mutant huntingtin interferes with many cellular processes, but the fact that modulation of ER stress and of the unfolded response pathways reduces the toxicity, places these mechanisms at the core and gives hope for potential therapeutic approaches. There is currently no effective treatment for HD and it has a fatal outcome a few years after the start of symptoms of cognitive and motor impairment. Here we will discuss recent findings that shed light on the mechanisms of protein misfolding and aggregation that give origin to ER stress in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Huntington's disease, on the cellular response and on how to use this knowledge for possible therapeutic strategies.",Applying Machine Learning of Erythrocytes Dynamic Antigens Store in Medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001536,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2019 04 21,"Erythrocytes Dynamic Antigens Store (EDAS) is a new discovery. EDAS consists of self-antigens and foreign (non-self) antigens. In patients with infectious diseases or malignancies, antigens of infection microorganism or malignant tumor exist in EDAS.

First, EDAS can be mined to determine biomarkers representing diseases which can enable researchers to develop a new line of laboratory diagnostic tests and vaccines. Second, EDAS can be queried, directly, to reach a precise diagnosis without the need to do many laboratory tests. The target is to find the minimum set of proteins that can be used as biomarkers for a particular disease. A hypothetical EDAS is created. Hundred-thousand records are randomly generated. The mathematical model of hypothetical EDAS together with the proposed techniques for biomarker discovery and direct diagnosis are described.

In longitudinal analyses, we assessed the directionality of the associations between maternal feeding practices and body mass index (BMI) in preschoolers. Participants were 428 mother child dyads from the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes) cohort. Feeding practices were assessed using the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire (CFPQ) at age 5 y. Child BMI was measured at ages 4 and 6 y. BMI and maternal feeding practices subscales were transformed to SD scores and both directions of their associations examined with multivariable linear regression and pathway modeling. Higher BMI at age 4 was associated with lower encouragement of balance and variety (β = -0.33; 95%CI: -0.53, -0.13), lower pressure to eat (β = -0.49; -0.68, -0.29) and higher restriction (β = 1.10; 0.67, 1.52) at age 5, adjusting for confounders and baseline feeding practices at 3 years. In the reverse direction, only pressure and restriction at age 5 were associated with lower and higher child BMI at age 6 years, respectively. After the adjustment for baseline BMI at age 5, the association with pressure was attenuated to non-significance (β = 0.01 (-0.01, 0.03), while the association with restriction remained significant (β = 0.02; 0.002, 0.03). Overall, associations from child BMI to maternal restriction for weight control and pressure feeding practices was stronger than the association from these maternal feeding practices to child BMI (Wald's statistics = 24.3 and 19.5, respectively; p < 0.001). The strength and directionality suggests that the mothers in the Asian population were likely to adopt these feeding practices in response to their child's BMI, rather than the converse.

Betacyanins are presently gaining higher interest in the food science as driven by their high tinctorial strength and health promoting functional properties. In this study, a novel green integration process of liquid biphasic electric partitioning system (LBEPS) was proposed for betacyanins extraction from peel and flesh of red-purple pitaya. Initially, the betacyanins extraction using LBEPS with initial settings was compared with that of liquid biphasic partitioning system (LBPS), and the results revealed that both systems demonstrated a comparable betacyanins extraction. This was followed by further optimizing the LBEPS for better betacyanins extraction. Several operating parameters including operation time, voltage applied, and position of graphitic electrodes in the system were investigated. Moreover, comparison between optimized LBEPS and LBPS with optimized conditions of electric system (as post-treatment) as well as color characterization and antioxidant properties assessment were conducted. Overall, the betacyanins extraction employing the optimized LBEPS showed the significant highest values of betacyanins concentration in alcohol-rich top phase (C

These results inferred that an optimal betacyanins extraction was successfully achieved by this approach. Also, the LBEPS with the peel and flesh showed phase volume ratio (V 
r

In that respect, in the recent years we have applied advanced atomistic simulation methods to investigate various properties of these materials on the atomic scale. In particular, we computed several structural, thermochemical, thermodynamic and radiation damage related parameters. From a theoretical point of view, these materials turn out to be excellent systems for testing quantum mechanics-based computational methods for strongly correlated electronic systems. On the other hand, by conducting joint atomistic modeling and experimental research, we have been able to obtain enhanced understanding of the properties of lanthanide phosphates. Here we discuss joint initiatives directed at understanding the thermodynamically driven long-term performance of these materials, including long-term stability of solid solutions with actinides and studies of structural incorporation of f elements into these materials. In particular, we discuss the maximum load of Pu into the lanthanide-phosphate monazites. We also address the importance of our results for applications of lanthanide-phosphates beyond nuclear waste applications, in particular the monazite-xenotime systems in geothermometry. For this we have derived a state-of-the-art model of monazite-xenotime solubilities. Last but not least, we discuss the advantage of usage of atomistic simulations and the modern computational facilities for understanding of behavior of nuclear waste-related materials.",The Influence of Interfacial Chemistry on Magnesium Electrodeposition in Non-nucleophilic Electrolytes Using Sulfone-Ether Mixtures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001520,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 04 21,"One of the limiting factors in the development of magnesium batteries is the reversibility of magnesium electrodeposition and dissolution at the anode. Often irreversibility is related to impurities and decomposition. Herein we report on the cycling behavior of magnesium metal anodes in different electrolytes, Mg(HMDS)2 - 4 MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and a butyl sulfone/THF mixture. The deposition morphology and anode-electrolyte interface is studied and related to Mg/Mg cell cycling performance. It is found that adding the sulfone caused the formation of a boundary layer at the electrode-electrolyte interface, which, in turn, resulted in a particle-like deposition morphology. This type of deposition has a high surface area, which alters the effective local current density and results in electronically isolated deposits. Extended cycling resulted in magnesium growth through a separator. Electrolyte decomposition is observed with and without the addition of the sulfone, however the addition of the sulfone increased the degree of decomposition.",Global Isomeric Survey of Elusive Cyclopropanetrione: Unknown but Viable Isomers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001519,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 04 21,"Despite the great interest in energy storage application, stable neutral CnOn (n > 1) structures either in thermodynamics or kinetics have yet been largely limited due to the rather high tendency to release the very stable CO molecule. The neutral cyclopropanetrione (C3O3) cluster has long remained elusive since no isomer with sufficient kinetic stability has been found either experimentally or theoretically. In this work, we constructed the first global potential energy surface of singlet C3O3 at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level, from which the kinetic stability of a wide range of C3O3 isomers can be determined by investigating their isomerization and fragmentation pathways. Amongst, a three-membered ring structure 01 is the global C3O3 isomer with a barrier of 10.6 kcal/mol at the sophisticated W1BD level. In particular, two carbene-type isomers 02 and 04 possess appreciable destruction barriers of 20.3 and 24.7 kcal/mol at W1BD, respectively. Thus, 02 and 04 can be useful building blocks for constructing larger high-energy density carbon-oxygen clusters. Moreover, with the carbene center, both might effectively functionalize various nano-materials while retaining the electrochemical active carbonyl and epoxyl moieties that are very desirable in alkali metal-ion batteries.","Fluoro-Aryl Substituted α,β2,3-Peptides in the Development of Foldameric Antiparallel β-Sheets: A Conformational Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001518,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 04 21,"α,β2,3-Disteroisomeric foldamers of general formula Boc(S-Ala-β-2R,3R-Fpg)nOMe or Boc(S-Ala-β-2S,3S-Fpg)nOMe were prepared from both enantiomers of syn H-2-(2-F-Phe)-h-PheGly-OH (named β-Fpg) and S-alanine. Our peptides show two appealing features for biomedical applications: the presence of fluorine, attractive for non-covalent interactions, and aryl groups, crucial for π-stacking. A conformational study was performed, using IR, NMR and computational studies of diastereoisomeric tetra- and hexapeptides containing the β2,3-amino acid in the R,R- and S,S-stereochemistry, respectively. We found that the stability of peptide conformation is dependent on the stereochemistry of the β-amino acid. Combining S-Ala with β-2R,3R-Fpg, a stable extended β-strand conformation was obtained. Furthermore, β-2R,3R-Fpg containing hexapeptide self-assembles to form antiparallel β-sheet structure stabilized by intermolecular H-bonds and π,π-interactions. These features make peptides containing the β2,3-fluoro amino acid very appealing for the development of bioactive proteolytically stable foldameric β-sheets as modulators of protein-protein interaction (PPI).","

We found that a mixture of agar (125 mg/L) and gelatin (30 mg/L) not only decreased the limonoid concentration and clarified the liquor, but also increased the precipitation content, retention rate of ascorbic acid, and antioxidant capacity. After treatment, the quality of the citrus wine was improved, and a few volatile chemical compounds were lost. We determined that agar and gelatin were the best fining agents for reducing DB in citrus wine.","Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Assay for Quantifying Fentanyl and 22 Analogs and Metabolites in Whole Blood, Urine, and Hair.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001514,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 04 21,"Recently, synthetic opioid-related overdose fatalities, led by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and analogs, increased at an alarming rate, posing a global public health threat. New synthetic fentanyl analogs have been constantly emerging onto the drug marked for the last few years, to circumvent the laws and avoid analytical detection. Analytical methods need to be regularly updated to keep up with the new trends. In this study, we aimed to develop a new method for detecting the newest fentanyl analogs with a high sensitivity, in whole blood, urine, and hair. The method is intended to provide to clinical and forensic toxicologists a tool for documenting consumption. We developed a comprehensive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for quantifying fentanyl and 22 analogs and metabolites. Urine samples were simply diluted before injection; a liquid-liquid extraction was performed for blood testing; and a solid phase extraction was performed in hair. The chromatographic separation was short (8 min). The method was validated with a high sensitivity; limits of quantifications ranged from 2 to 6 ng/L in blood and urine, and from 11 to 21 pg/g in hair. The suitability of the method was tested with 42 postmortem blood, urine, or hair specimens from 27 fatalities in which fentanyl analogs were involved.

The approach relies on the direct injection of dopamine acrylamide dissolved in 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate as comonomer into the plasma zone. By adjusting the pulsing of the electrical discharge, the reactive plasma process can be alternatively switch ON (tON) and OFF (tOFF) during different periods of time, thus allowing a facile and fine tuning of the catechol density, morphology and deposition rate of the coating. An optimal tON/tOFF ratio is established, that permits maximizing the catechol content in the deposited film. Finally, a diagram, based on the average energy input into the process, is proposed allowing for easy custom synthesis of layers with specific chemical and physical properties, thus highlighting the utility of the developed dry plasma route."

Even when children and adolescents have a history of recurrent asthma-like symptoms and risk factors embedded in their medical records, this information is sometimes overlooked by clinicians at the point of care. Given the rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems, early identification of childhood asthma can be achieved utilizing (1) asthma ascertainment criteria leveraging relevant clinical information embedded in EHR and (2) innovative informatics approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for asthma ascertainment criteria to enable such a strategy. In this review, we discuss literature relevant to this topic and introduce recently published informatics algorithms (criteria-based NLP) as a potential solution to address the current challenge of early identification of childhood asthma.",Social Networks and Mobile Applications Use in Young Patients With Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001498,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 21,"Objective: To evaluate the use and benefits of social networking sites (SNS) and mobile applications (MA) in young patients with kidney disease (KD). Background: Pediatric KD is prevalent. The Internet is increasingly being used to communicate rapid healthcare information to children about acute and chronic diseases with greater medical care satisfaction. There is a lack of data on social media (SM) utility in pediatric KD. Materials and Methods: A descriptive, observational, and cross-sectional study was conducted on a national level. Data were collected from 4 different centers through a reviewed questionnaire. Results: 83.9% of the 428 participants were Lebanese. The average age was 11.4 years (±7.1). 69.9% had chronic KD out of which 17.4% had undergone a kidney transplant while 9% were on dialysis. 69.6% of the participants affirmed the need of SM for the health of the sick child while only 9.8% are participating in a scientific forum and 4.7% used SM to find a potential organ donor. Some study variables were statistically associated with the participants' age, nationality, and stage of KD. Conclusions: SM is important for the support and management of pediatric KD. We believe that SNS and MA will play a leading role in the lives of our patients in the upcoming future and will push the physician to be an active participant in the evolution of communication networks. To identify the efficacy of SM in enhancing communication between patients and health professionals, further stratified studies are needed.",45S5 Bioglass paste is capable of protecting the enamel surrounding orthodontic brackets against erosive challenge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001497,Journal of orthodontic science,2019 04 21,This study aimed at evaluating the effect of using a 45S5 bioglass paste and a topical fluoride as protective agents against acidic erosion (resembling acidic beverage softdrinks intake) for enamel surrounding orthodontic brackets.,Alterations in the gustatory papillae after anterior bite plate insertion in growing rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001496,Journal of orthodontic science,2019 04 21,"To determine whether the modification of dental occlusion, without molar extraction, affected the gustatory papillae located in the tongue of growing rats.",Prevalence of malocclusion among school children of Southern Saudi Arabia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001494,Journal of orthodontic science,2019 04 21,"To evaluate the status of occlusion among school children in city of Abha, Saudi Arabia.",Agreement and association between normative and subjective orthodontic treatment need using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001493,Journal of orthodontic science,2019 04 21,To determine the association and level of agreement between young adults' perception of orthodontic treatment need (subjective need) and the orthodontists' assessment of treatment need (normative objective need).,Competence in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Close Commensal Relatives: Mechanisms and Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001492,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 04 21,"The mitis group of streptococci comprises species that are common colonizers of the naso-oral-pharyngeal tract of humans. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis are close relatives and share ~60-80% of orthologous genes, but still present striking differences in pathogenic potential toward the human host. S. mitis has long been recognized as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes for S. pneumoniae, as well as a source for capsule polysaccharide variation, leading to resistance and vaccine escape. Both species share the ability to become naturally competent, and in this context, competence-associated killing mechanisms such as fratricide are thought to play an important role in interspecies gene exchange. Here, we explore the general mechanism of natural genetic transformation in the two species and touch upon the fundamental clinical and evolutionary implications of sharing similar competence, fratricide mechanisms, and a large fraction of their genomic DNA.",Toward DNA-Based T-Cell Mediated Vaccines to Target HIV-1 and Hepatitis C Virus: Approaches to Elicit Localized Immunity for Protection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001491,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 04 21,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major contributors to the global disease burden with many experts recognizing the requirement of an effective vaccine to bring a durable end to these viral epidemics. The most promising vaccine candidates that have advanced into pre-clinical models and the clinic to eliminate or provide protection against these chronic viruses are viral vectors [e.g., recombinant cytomegalovirus, Adenovirus, and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)]. This raises the question, is there a need to develop DNA vaccines against HIV-1 and HCV? Since the initial study from Wolff and colleagues which showed that DNA represents a vector that can be used to express transgenes durably in vivo, DNA has been regularly evaluated as a vaccine vector albeit with limited success in large animal models and humans. However, several recent studies in Phase I-IIb trials showed that vaccination of patients with recombinant DNA represents a feasible therapeutic intervention to even cure cervical cancer, highlighting the potential of using DNA for human vaccinations. In this review, we will discuss the limitations and the strategies of using DNA as a vector to develop prophylactic T cell-mediated vaccines against HIV-1 and HCV. In particular, we focus on potential strategies exploiting DNA vectors to elicit protective localized CD8+ T cell immunity in the liver for HCV and in the cervicovaginal mucosa for HIV-1 as localized immunity will be an important, if not critical component, of an efficacious vaccine against these viral infections.",The Gut Microbiome Signatures Discriminate Healthy From Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001490,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 04 21,"Cross talk occurs between the human gut and the lung through a gut-lung axis involving the gut microbiota.

We observed a dramatic changes in gut microbiota in tuberculosis patients as reflected by significant decreases in species number and microbial diversity. The gut microbiota of TB patients were mostly featured by the striking decrease of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producingbacteria as well as associated metabolic pathways. A classification model based on the abundance of three species, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Roseburia inulinivorans, and Roseburia hominis, performed well for discriminating between healthy and diseased patients.

Normally, the gut microbiota has distinct metabolic capacities, making their role in metabolism of dietary components indispensable. In preterm infants, variation in microbiota composition is introduced while facing a unique set of environmental conditions. However, the effect of such variation on the microbiota's metabolic capacity and on the preterm infant's growth and development remains unresolved. In this review, we will provide a holistic overview on the development of the preterm gut microbiota and the unique environmental conditions contributing to this, in addition to maturation of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system in preterm infants. The role of prematurity, as well as the role of human milk, in the developmental processes is emphasized. Current research stresses the early life gut microbiota as cornerstone for simultaneous development of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Besides that, literature provides clues that prematurity affects growth and development. As such, this review is concluded with our hypothesis that prematurity of the gut microbiota may be an inconspicuous clinical challenge in achieving optimal feeding besides traditional challenges, such as preterm breast milk composition, high nutritional requirements and immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system. A better understanding of the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota and its impact on gut and immune maturation in preterm infants could complement current feeding regimens in future neonatal care and thereby facilitate growth, development and health in preterm infants."

Two tumor cell lines, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) 13271 and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 14736, were previously established from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) miniature swine herd. PTLD 13271 is a swine B-cell lymphoma line originating from an animal that developed PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), while CML 14736 was generated from a swine that spontaneously developed CML. In order to select for aggressive tumor variants, both lines were passage into NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor γ-/- (NSG) mice. Tumor induced mortality in mice injected with CML14736 was 68% while 100% of mice injected with PTLD 13271 succumbed to PTLD by day 70. Based on aggressiveness, PTLD 13271 was selected for further development and re-passage into NSG mice resulting in increased tumor burden and metastasis. Transduction of the PTLD 13271 cell line with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing lentivirus facilitated tumor tracking when re-passaged in mice. Utilizing a tolerance induction strategy, GFP+ tumors were injected into an MHC matched miniature swine and successfully followed via flow cytometry for 48 h in circulation, although tumor engraftment was not observed.

Our group recently demonstrated that tobacco carcinogen-exposed mice with knockout of the airway lineage G-protein coupled receptor, Gprc5a, develop LUADs with somatic mutations in Kras. Earlier work has suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial roles in clonal evolution of tumors and in therapy resistance. To date, our understanding of CSCs in LUADs with somatic Kras mutations remains lagging. Here we derived CSCs (as spheres in 3D cultures) with self-renewal properties from a murine Kras-mutant LUAD cell line we previously established from a tobacco carcinogen-exposed Gprc5a-/- mouse. Using syngeneic Gprc5a-/- models, we found that these CSCs, compared to their parental isoforms, exhibited increased tumorigenic potential in vivo, particularly in female animals. Using whole-transcriptome sequencing coupled with pathways analysis and confirmatory PCR, we identified gene features (n = 2,600) differentially expressed in the CSCs compared to parental cells and that were enriched with functional modules associated with an augmented malignant phenotype including stemness, tumor-promoting inflammation and anti-oxidant responses. Further, based on in silico predicted activation of GSK3β in CSCs, we found that tideglusib, an irreversible inhibitor of the kinase, exhibited marked anti-growth effects in the cultured CSCs. Our study underscores molecular cues in the pathogenesis of Kras-mutant LUAD and presents new models to study the evolution, and thus high-potential targets, of this aggressive malignancy.",Performance of Different Combination Models of High-Risk HPV Genotyping in Triaging Chinese Women With Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001472,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 21,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different combination models of high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPV) genotyping in triaging Chinese women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Methods: We established a screening cohort of 3,997 Chinese women who underwent cervical cytology and HPV genotyping test. Women with ASCUS cytology underwent punch biopsy under colposcopy/endocervical curettage. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of different combination models of HR-HPV genotyping calculated that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or higher (CIN2+) on histology were endpoints. Results: Of the full sample, 393 women had ASCUS. Among ASCUS women with a CIN2 lesion, the prevalence for HPV were 40.0% (type 16), 10.0% (type 18), 0.0% (type 33), 30.0% (type 52), 40.0% (type 58), and 30.0% (other nine types). For ASCUS women with a CIN3 lesion, the prevalence for HPV were 68.4% (type 16), 15.8% (type 18), 10.5% (type 33), 31.6% (type 52), 15.8% (type 58), and 36.8% (other nine types). Combination model including HPV16/18/33/52/58 for predicting CIN2+ lesion in women with ASCUS had relatively higher sensitivity [93.1% (78.0, 98.1)], specificity [75.8% (71.2, 79.9)], PPV [23.5% (16.7, 32.0)], and NPV [99.3% (97.4, 99.8)] than other combination models. Moreover, the referral rate of HPV16/18/33/52/58 (29.3%) was lower than HR-HPV (36.1%). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that specific HR-HPV types HPV16/18/33/52/58 may be an effective strategy in ASCUS triage.

To measure the degree to which the typical parameters of CP OCT images can be matched to the actual histology, 100 images of tumors and white matter were selected for visual analysis to be undertaken by three ""single-blinded"" investigators. An evaluation of the inter-rater reliability between the investigators was performed. Application of the identified visual CP OCT criteria for intraoperative use was performed during brain tumor resection in 17 patients. Results: The CP OCT image parameters that can typically be used for visual assessment were separated: (1) signal intensity; (2) homogeneity of intensity; (3) attenuation rate; (4) uniformity of attenuation. The degree of match between the CP OCT images and the histology of the specimens was significant for the parameters ""signal intensity"" in both polarizations, and ""homogeneity of intensity"" as well as the ""uniformity of attenuation"" in co-polarization. A test based on the identified criteria showed a diagnostic accuracy of 87-88%. Intraoperative in vivo CP OCT images of white matter and tumors have similar signals to ex vivo ones, whereas the cortex in vivo is characterized by indicative vertical striations arising from the ""shadows"" of the blood vessels; these are not seen in ex vivo images or in the case of tumor invasion. Conclusion: Visual assessment of CP OCT images enables tumorous and non-tumorous tissues to be distinguished. The most powerful aspect of CP OCT images that can be used as a criterion for differentiation between tumorous tissue and white matter is the signal intensity. In distinguishing white matter from tumors the diagnostic accuracy using the identified visual CP OCT criteria was 87-88%. As the CP OCT data is easily associated with intraoperative neurophysiological and neuronavigation findings this can provide valuable complementary information for the neurosurgeon tumor resection.",Histone Modifications Drive Aberrant Notch3 Expression/Activity and Growth in T-ALL.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001470,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 21,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive blood cancer caused by the deregulation of key T-cell developmental pathways, including Notch signaling. Aberrant Notch signaling in T-ALL occurs by NOTCH1 gain-of-function mutations and by NOTCH3 overexpression. Although NOTCH3 is assumed as a Notch1 target, machinery driving its transcription in T-ALL is undefined in leukemia subsets lacking Notch1 activation. Here, we found that the binding of the intracellular Notch3 domain, as well as of the activated Notch1 fragment, to the NOTCH3 gene locus led to the recruitment of the H3K27 modifiers JMJD3 and p300, and it was required to preserve transcriptional permissive/active H3K27 marks and to sustain NOTCH3 gene expression levels. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of JMJD3 by GSKJ4 treatment or of p300 by A-485 decreased the levels of expression of NOTCH3, NOTCH1 and of the Notch target genes DELTEX1 and c-Myc and abrogated cell viability in both Notch1- and Notch3-dependent T-cell contexts. Notably, re-introduction of exogenous Notch1, Notch3 as well as c-Myc partially rescued cells from anti-growth effects induced by either treatment. Overall our findings indicate JMJD3 and p300 as general Notch1 and Notch3 signaling co-activators in T-ALL and suggest further investigation on the potential therapeutic anti-leukemic efficacy of their enzymatic inhibition in Notch/c-Myc axis-related cancers and diseases.",Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid-Derived Exosomes: A Novel Role Contributing to Lung Cancer Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001469,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 21,"Exosomes are nanovesicles produced by a number of different cell types and regarded as important mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Although bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has been shown to be involved in the development of tumors, its role in lung cancer (LC) remains unclear. In this article, we systemically studied BALF-derived exosomes in LC. C57BL/6 mice were injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells and exposed to non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi) lysate. The analysis showed that the growth of lung tumors in these mice was significantly enhanced compared with the control cohort (only exposure to air). Characterization of the exosomes derived from mouse BALF demonstrated elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in mice exposed to NTHi lysates. Furthermore, abnormal BALF-derived exosomes facilitated the development of LC in vitro and in vivo. The internalization of the BALF-derived exosomes contributed to the development of LC tumors. Collectively, our data demonstrated that exosomes in BALF are a key factor involved in the growth and progression of lung cancer.",Clinical Experience with Hemopatch® as a Dural Sealant in Cranial Neurosurgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001467,Cureus,2019 04 21,"Herein, we report our clinical experience with the novel polyethylene glycol-covered matrix dural onlay, Hemopatch® (Baxter Deutschland GmbH, Unterschleißheim, Germany) for the prevention of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas.","Safety and Efficacy of Sofosbuvir with Ribavirin® in Hepatitis C, Genotype 3 Patients with Cirrhosis: A Real-world Experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001466,Cureus,2019 04 21,"Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of cirrhosis. The advent of Directly Acting Antivirals (DAAs) like Sofosbuvir (SOF) has dramatized the treatment and is the cornerstone for the treatment of HCV. Most trials have been conducted in HCV genotype 1 (GT-1) and data for Interferon-free regimen in genotype 3 (GT-3) is limited especially in cirrhotic patients. Aim To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SOF plus Ribavirin® (RIB) in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Methods This was a quasi-experimental study in HCV patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Each group (compensated and decompensated) was further subdivided into the treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced groups. Efficacy was assessed by end treatment response (ETR) and sustained viral response (SVR) in the treatment-naïve and experienced groups. Adverse events were recorded on designed proforma on serial follow-up visits. Results The study consisted of 110 consecutive patients. Among 110 patients, 51 had compensated cirrhosis and 59 had decompensated cirrhosis. The mean age was 53.8 ± 11 years. Males were n=56 (50.9%) and females were n=54 (49.1%). All the patients in Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A were in the compensated group. CTP B class was found to be 10.5% and 89.5% in the compensated and decompensated groups, respectively, whereas all the patients in CTP class C were in the decompensated group. In the compensated cirrhosis group, ETR was achieved in 36 (87.8%) treatment-naïve and 8 (88.9%) experienced patients. In decompensated cirrhosis, treatment-naïve and experienced patients achieved ETR in 28 (82.4%) and 18 (85.7%) patients, respectively. Whereas in compensated cirrhosis treatment-naïve and experienced patients, SVR was achieved in 25 (83.3%) and five (71.4%), respectively. In decompensated cirrhosis, 21 (77.8%) treatment-naïve and 12 (75%) experienced patients achieved SVR. The most common adverse events experienced by the patients were fatigue followed by myalgia, nausea, and diarrhea. The new onset of complications found due to cirrhosis were ascites, followed by hepatoma, upper gastrointestinal bleed, portosystemic encephalopathy, acute on chronic liver failure, and death. Conclusion Sofosbuvir in combination with Ribavirin® is safe but suboptimal in treatment outcomes, particularly in treatment-experienced patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in treatment-naive patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV GT-3."

However, little is known about the degree of genetic diversity in the populations of this pathogen. In this study, we collected 55 isolates from pear scab lesions in 13 major cultivation areas in Korea and examined the diversity using sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, β-tubulin (TUB2), and translation elongation factor-1α (TEF-1α) genes as molecular markers. Despite a low level of overall sequence variation, we found three distinctive subgroups from phylogenetic analysis of combined ITS, TUB2, and TEF-1α sequences. Among the three subgroups, subgroup 1 (60% of isolates collected) was predominant compared to subgroup 2 (23.6%) or subgroup 3 (16.4%) and was distributed throughout Korea. To understand the genetic diversity among the subgroups, RAPD analysis was performed. The isolates yielded highly diverse amplicon patterns and none of the defined subgroups within the dendrogram were supported by bootstrap values greater than 30%. Moreover, there is no significant correlation between the geographical distribution and the subgroups defined by molecular phylogeny. Our data suggest a low level of genetic diversification among the populations of V. nashicola in Korea.","Fungal Diversity and Enzyme Activity Associated with the Macroalgae, Agarum clathratum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001450,Mycobiology,2019 04 21,"Agarum clathratum, a brown macroalgae species, has recently become a serious environmental problem on the coasts of Korea. In an effort to solve this problem, fungal diversity associated with decaying A. clathratum was investigated and related β-glucosidase and endoglucanase activities were described. A total of 233 fungal strains were isolated from A. clathratum at 15 sites and identified 89 species based on morphology and a multigene analysis using the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and protein-coding genes including actin (act), β-tubulin (benA), calmodulin (CaM), and translation elongation factor (tef1). Acremonium, Corollospora, and Penicillium were the dominant genera, and Acremonium fuci and Corollospora gracilis were the dominant species. Fifty-one species exhibited cellulase activity, with A. fuci, Alfaria terrestris, Hypoxylon perforatum, P. madriti, and Pleosporales sp. Five showing the highest enzyme activities.

Approximately, two-thirds of the housing stock is uninsulated and many homes are inadequately heated, with an average indoor temperature of 14.5°C. Cold, damp, and mouldy housing results in poor health; each year, respiratory hospital admissions are 74% higher during winter, and excess winter mortality is 20% higher than other seasons. The relationship between injury and housing conditions is also well established. Each year, 500,000 New Zealanders suffer falls requiring medical treatment in their homes. As a step towards improving the quality of existing housing, an evidence-based warrant of fitness has been developed. This article outlines the evidence base to each criterion in the warrant of fitness. We conclude that introducing and properly enforcing a housing warrant of fitness will ensure that basic minimum standards are met, which could mitigate the disease burdens and injuries associated with, or caused, by poorer quality housing.

However, recent studies of regulation of P2X receptor expression following nerve injury have produced variable or conflicting results. In the present study the alteration of expression of P2X1-6 receptor subunits in retrograde Flurorogold (FG)-labeled L4+L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were evaluated following unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the rat sciatic nerve using immunohistochemistry combined with a retrograde fluorescence-tracing method. It was demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the proportion of FG-labeled DRG neurons between the sham and CCI groups (P>0.5). The percentages of P2X1-immunoreactive (IR) and P2X2-IR FG-labeled DRG neurons were not significantly different between the sham and CCI groups (41.5±8.2 vs. 45.2±7.4% and 58.1±6.2 vs. 69.1±3.5%, P>0.05). The percentages of P2X3-IR and P2X6-IR FG-labeled DRG neurons significantly increased in the CCI group compared with the sham group (51.6±4.1 vs. 28.5±3.4% and 41.8±2.2 vs. 22.6±3.3%, P>0.01). By contrast, the percentage of P2X4-IR FG-labeled DRG neurons significantly decreased in the CCI group compared with the sham group (29.4±3.3 vs. 45.0±3.7%, P<0.01). The P2X5-IR positive FG-labeled neurons were not detected in the CCI and sham groups. The results of the present study provided the first evidence regarding the regulation of the expression of the P2X1-6 receptor in sensory neurons being directly associated with chronic nerve injury in rats and also suggest that compared with the P2X3 receptor, the P2X2/3 heteromeric receptor is not the major receptor involved in peripheral neuropathic pain sensation. In addition, the possible functional role of P2X6 receptors in peripheral neuropathic pain requires further investigation."

The anticancer efficacy of X-ray radiotherapy has been frequently correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, which is also a limiting factor for its toxicity on normal tissues. Here, we found that although 4-10 Gy X-rays could significantly reduce cell numbers in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the ROS level changes are less in MCF-7 cells than in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, although both the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and 1 T static magnetic field (SMF) could reduce X-ray-induced ROS elevation, they did not prevent X-ray-induced cell number reduction or cell death increase, which is significantly different from cisplatin. These results demonstrate that although the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin on two breast cancer cell lines is dependent on ROS, the anticancer efficacy of X-ray is not.

The presence of extracanal was categorized based on the level they were first detected. Among the maxillary first molars, 28 (80%) and six (17%) teeth had two and three MB canals, respectively. Among the maxillary second molars, 24 (80%) and four (13%) teeth had two and three MB canals, respectively.

Among them, the MB2 canal could be immediately detected in 70% and 61% of the maxillary first and second molars, respectively, once the pulp chamber is exposed. However, the rest of the MB2 were observed at deeper levels in the root and this requires troughing preparation in the chamber floor.","Intermetallic Differences at CdS-Metal (Ni, Pd, Pt, and Au) Interfaces: From Single-Atom to Subnanometer Metal Clusters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001370,"The journal of physical chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and interfaces",2019 04 21,"Metal co-catalysts tipped at a photocatalyst surface form a crucial component in the nanoheterostructures designed for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To examine the intermetallic differences and size effects at these interfaces, we use spin-polarized density functional theory to study single-atom, 13-atom, and 55-atom cluster depositions of Ni, Pd, Pt, and Au on the CdS(101̅0) surface. For the single metal atoms, the ground-state configuration was the same site for all of the elements. Analysis of the metal-CdS bonding and of the charge transfers revealed a Ni-Cd bonding complex leading to depletion of electronic charge at the Ni single atom and at deposited Ni clusters, in contrast to charge accumulation observed for the other three metals Pd, Pt, and Au. For scaling up sizes of the metal deposition, six subnanometer cluster types were selected over a wide range of cluster's effective coordination number, and their interfaces were differentiated by charge redistributions, structure and adhesion energies, highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gaps, and Schottky barrier heights. Although all considered clusters are semiconducting in the gas phase, 9 out of 28 clusters became (semi)metallic after deposition on the CdS semiconductor surface. Intermetallic differences and common trends are discussed.","One Precursor but Two Types of Graphene Nanoribbons: On-Surface Transformations of 10,10'-Dichloro-9,9'-bianthryl on Ag(111).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001369,"The journal of physical chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and interfaces",2019 04 21,"On-surface synthesis has emerged in the last decade as a method to create graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with atomic precision. The underlying premise of this bottom-up strategy is that precursor molecules undergo a well-defined sequence of inter- and intramolecular reactions, leading to the formation of a single product. As such, the structure of the GNR is encoded in the precursors. However, recent examples have shown that not only the molecule, but also the coinage metal surface on which the reaction takes place, plays a decisive role in dictating the nanoribbon structure. In this work, we use scanning probe microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate the behavior of 10,10'-dichloro-9,9'-bianthryl (DCBA) on Ag(111). Our study shows that Ag(111) can induce the formation of both seven-atom wide armchair GNRs (7-acGNRs) and 3,1-chiral GNRs (3,1-cGNRs), demonstrating that a single molecule on a single surface can react to different nanoribbon products. We additionally show that coadsorbed dibromoperylene can promote surface-assisted dehydrogenative coupling in DCBA, leading to the exclusive formation of 3,1-cGNRs.",Cross-Cultural Validation of the English Chronic Pain Myth Scale in Emergency Nurses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001368,Pain research & management,2019 04 21,"Utilization of the emergency department (ED) by patients seeking relief from chronic pain (CP) has increased.

In this study, the in-plane Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ), and thermal conductivity (κ) of sorted semiconducting SWNT (s-SWNT) free-standing sheets with different s-SWNT purities are measured to determine the figure of merit ZT. We find that the ZT value of the sheets increases with increasing s-SWNT purity, mainly due to an increase in Seebeck coefficient while the thermal conductivity remaining constant, which experimentally proved the superiority of the high purity s-SWNT as TE materials for the first time. In addition, from the comparison between sorted and unsorted SWNT sheets, it is recognized that the difference of ZT between unsorted SWNT and high-purity s-SWNT sheet is not remarkable, which suggests the control of carrier density is necessary to further clarify the superiority of SWNT sorting for TE applications.",Tuning phonon transport spectrum for better thermoelectric materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001366,Science and technology of advanced materials,2019 04 21,"The figure of merit of thermoelectric materials can be increased by suppressing the lattice thermal conductivity without degrading electrical properties. Phonons are the carriers for lattice thermal conduction, and their transport can be impeded by nanostructuring, owing to the recent progress in nanotechnology. The key question for further improvement of thermoelectric materials is how to realize ultimate structure with minimum lattice thermal conductivity. From spectral viewpoint, this means to impede transport of phonons in the entire spectral domain with noticeable contribution to lattice thermal conductivity that ranges in general from subterahertz to tens of terahertz in frequency. To this end, it is essential to know how the phonon transport varies with the length scale, morphology, and composition of nanostructures, and how effects of different nanostructures can be mutually adopted in view of the spectral domain.

Stem cell microencapsulation combined with imaging contrast agents may provide a means to simultaneously enhance cell survival and enable cell tracking with noninvasive imaging. Here, we have evaluated a novel MRI- and X-ray-visible microcapsule formulation for allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery and tracking in a large animal model. Bone marrow-derived MSCs from male New Zealand White rabbits were encapsulated using a modified cell encapsulation method to incorporate a dual-modality imaging contrast agent, perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB). PFOB microcapsules (PFOBCaps) were then transplanted into the medial thigh of normal or PAD female rabbits. In vitro MSC viability remained high (79 ± 5% at 4 weeks of postencapsulation), and as few as two and ten PFOBCaps could be detected in phantoms using clinical C-arm CT and 19F MRI, respectively. Successful injections of PFOBCaps in the medial thigh of normal (n = 15) and PAD (n = 16) rabbits were demonstrated on C-arm CT at 1-14 days of postinjection. Using 19F MRI, transplanted PFOBCaps were clearly identified as ""hot spots"" and showed one-to-one correspondence to the radiopacities on C-arm CT. Concordance of 19F MRI and C-arm CT locations of PFOBCaps with postmortem locations was high (95%). Immunohistological analysis revealed high MSC survival in PFOBCaps (>56%) two weeks after transplantation while naked MSCs were no longer viable beyond three days after delivery. These findings demonstrate that PFOBCaps could maintain cell viability even in the ischemic tissue and provide a means to monitor cell delivery and track engraftment using clinical noninvasive imaging systems.","Comparison of Serum Potassium, MagnEsium, and Calcium Levels between Kanamycin and Capreomycin-BASEd Regimen-Treated MultiDrug-Resistant TuBerculosis Patients in Bandung (CEASE MDR-TB): A Retrospective Cohort Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001341,International journal of microbiology,2019 04 21,"Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with second-line injectable drugs may result in an electrolyte imbalance. This retrospective study was performed to compare and evaluate the effect of kanamycin and capreomycin on serum potassium, calcium, and magnesium in the first and second month treatment at a tertiary, top-referral hospital in Bandung, Indonesia. Data from 84 subjects with complete medical records of at least serum potassium during either kanamycin-based or capreomycin-based treatment were retrieved from the institutional database. Among these, 53 subjects had complete serum calcium data and 53 subjects had complete serum magnesium data. After the first month of MDR-TB treatment, there was a significant decrease in mean serum potassium (4.0 ± 0.4 mEq/L to 3.7 ± 0.5 mEq/L, p < 0.003) in the kanamycin-based group and (4.1 ± 0.5 mEq/L to 3.2 ± 0.6 mEq/L, p < 0.001) in the capreomycin-based group. Serum potassium levels were significantly lower in the capreomycin-based group than in the kanamycin-based group (3.2 ± 0.6 mEq/L vs 3.7 ± 0.5 mEq/L, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalization and requirement for a change in the treatment regimen due to electrolyte imbalances were higher in the capreomycin-based group. No previous longitudinal study has evaluated serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium from the first month of MDR-TB treatment with either kanamycin-based or capreomycin-based regimens. Our findings emphasize the importance of routine monitoring of serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium during MDR-TB treatment, and that more attention should be paid when treatment is given using the capreomycin-based regimen. Moreover, our study supported the 2018 World Health Organization treatment guideline recommendations for removal of kanamycin and capreomycin from the MDR-TB regimens.",Resistance of Synthetic and Biologic Surgical Meshes to Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm: An In Vitro Investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001340,International journal of biomaterials,2019 04 21,"Surgical meshes have become the standard procedure for a variety of surgical applications with 20 million meshes being implanted each year.

However, their use has also been associated with infectious surgical complications and many surgeons have turned to biologic meshes. While there have been several studies investigating synthetic meshes, there is limited data comparing synthetic and biologic meshes in vitro in an infection model. This study evaluates the in vitro susceptibility of both synthetic and biologic meshes to single-species methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms. This research compares biofilm biomass, average thickness, and coverage between the three meshes through florescent in situ hybridization (FISH), confocal scanning microscopy (CSLM), and image analysis.

Response surface methodology (RSM) indicated that the optimal extraction conditions were 78% ethanol concentration, six extraction times, 2 h, and 1:50 solid-liquid ratio. Under these conditions, the total flavonoid content could reach 35 mg/50 mL. In vitro tyrosinase experiment, the extracted total flavonoids had better inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity than β-arbutin, and its inhibition rate for monophenolase and diphenolase exceeded 100% and 70%, respectively.

Finasteride is also presumed to improve the developing follicle environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to observe the effects of the combination of exercise and finasteride therapy on hormone levels and ovarian morphology in rats with polycystic ovary syndrome. Forty female rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8 each group): the PCOS sedentary group (P-Sed), PCOS exercise group (P-Ex), PCOS finasteride and sedentary group (P-FSed), and PCOS finasteride and exercise group (P-FEx), and healthy, age-matched rats were used as controls (CO). The results indicated that the levels of FINS in the P-FEx group were significantly lower than those in the P-Sed and P-FSed groups, while the ratio of fasting blood glucose (FBG)/fasting serum levels of insulin (FINS) in the P-FEx group was significantly higher than that in the P-Sed and P-FSed groups. Compared to the P-FEx group, serum levels of TT (total testosterone) in the P-Sed and P-FSed groups were significantly increased. The thickness of the follicular membrane and the number of atresia follicles in the P-FEx and CO groups were significantly lower than those in the P-Sed group, but there was no significant difference between the P-Ex and P-Sed groups. These results show that the combined usage of exercise and finasteride does not alter the effects of exercise on increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels. There is also a synergistic effect of exercise and finasteride on the morphology of the ovary, including a reduced number of atresia follicles and thickness of the follicular membrane.",Identifying and Validating Genes with DNA Methylation Data in the Context of Biological Network for Chinese Patients with Graves' Orbitopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001336,International journal of endocrinology,2019 04 21,This study investigated the association of DNA methylation with Graves' orbitopathy (GO) incidence through a combined analysis in the context of biological network to identify and validate potential genes for Chinese patients with GO.

These mutations may disrupt the gene regulation by affecting protein-DNA interaction. A study of these disruptions is important in understanding tumorigenesis. However, current computational tools process DNA sequence variants individually, when predicting the effect on protein-DNA binding. Thus, it is a daunting task to identify functional regulatory disturbances among thousands of mutations in a patient. Previously, we have reported and validated a pipeline for identifying functional non-coding somatic mutations in cancer patient cohorts, by integrating diverse information such as gene expression, spatial distribution of the mutations, and a biophysical model for estimating protein binding affinity. Here, we present a new user-friendly Python package BayesPI-BAR2 based on the proposed pipeline for integrative whole-genome sequence analysis. This may be the first prediction package that considers information from both multiple mutations and multiple patients. It is evaluated in follicular lymphoma and skin cancer patients, by focusing on sequence variants in gene promoter regions. BayesPI-BAR2 is a useful tool for predicting functional non-coding mutations in whole genome sequencing data: it allows identification of novel transcription factors (TFs) whose binding is altered by non-coding mutations in cancer.

Current knowledge states that different cell types communicate by ligand-receptor interactions: hormones, growth factors, and cytokines are released into the extracellular space and act on receptors, which are often expressed in a cell-type-specific manner. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as newly identified communicating factors in both physiological and pathological states. This class of RNA encompasses microRNAs (miRNAs, well-studied post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and other ncRNAs. lncRNAs are diverse in length, sequence, and structure (linear or circular), and their functions are described as transcriptional regulation, induction of epigenetic changes and even direct regulation of protein activity. They have also been reported to act as miRNA sponges, interacting with miRNA and modulating its availability to endogenous mRNA targets. Importantly, lncRNAs may have a cell-type-specific expression pattern. In this paper, we propose that lncRNA-miRNA interactions, analogous to receptor-ligand interactions, are responsible for cell-type-specific outcomes. Specific binding of miRNAs to lncRNAs may drive cell-type-specific signaling cascades and modulate biochemical feedback loops that ultimately determine cell identity and response to stress factors.",UltraStrain: An NGS-Based Ultra Sensitive Strain Typing Method for Salmonella enterica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001322,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 21,"In the last few years, advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for whole genome sequencing (WGS) of foodborne pathogens have provided drastic improvements in food pathogen outbreak surveillance. WGS of foodborne pathogen enables identification of pathogens from food or environmental samples, including difficult-to-detect pathogens in culture-negative infections. Compared to traditional low-resolution methods such as the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), WGS provides advantages to differentiate even closely related strains of the same species, thus enables rapid identification of food-source associated with pathogen outbreak events for a fast mitigation plan. In this paper, we present UltraStrain, which is a fast and ultra sensitive pathogen detection and strain typing method for Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) based on WGS data analysis. In the proposed method, a noise filtering step is first performed where the raw sequencing data are mapped to a synthetic species-specific reference genome generated from S. enterica specific marker sequences to avoid potential interference from closely related species for low spike samples. After that, a statistical learning based method is used to identify candidate strains, from a database of known S. enterica strains, that best explain the retained S. enterica specific reads.Finally, a refinement step is further performed by mapping all the reads before filtering onto the identified top candidate strains, and recalculating the probability of presence for each candidate strain. Experiment results using both synthetic and real sequencing data show that the proposed method is able to identify the correct S. enterica strains from low-spike samples, and outperforms several existing strain-typing methods in terms of sensitivity and accuracy.",Identifying Disease-Gene Associations With Graph-Regularized Manifold Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001321,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 21,"Complex diseases are known to be associated with disease genes. Uncovering disease-gene associations is critical for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Computational algorithms which effectively predict candidate disease-gene associations prior to experimental proof can greatly reduce the associated cost and time. Most existing methods are disease-specific which can only predict genes associated with a specific disease at a time. Similarities among diseases are not used during the prediction. Meanwhile, most methods predict new disease genes based on known associations, making them unable to predict disease genes for diseases without known associated genes.In this study, a manifold learning-based method is proposed for predicting disease-gene associations by assuming that the geodesic distance between any disease and its associated genes should be shorter than that of other non-associated disease-gene pairs. The model maps the diseases and genes into a lower dimensional manifold based on the known disease-gene associations, disease similarity and gene similarity to predict new associations in terms of the geodesic distance between disease-gene pairs. In the 3-fold cross-validation experiments, our method achieves scores of 0.882 and 0.854 in terms of the area under of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for diseases with more than one known associated genes and diseases with only one known associated gene, respectively.

Till this day, transcriptome-wide m6A RNA methylation sites have been identified by high-throughput sequencing technique combined with computational methods, and the information is publicly available in a few bioinformatics databases; however, the association between individual m6A sites and various diseases are still largely unknown. There are yet computational approaches developed for investigating potential association between individual m6A sites and diseases, which represents a major challenge in the epitranscriptome analysis. Thus, to infer the disease-related m6A sites, we implemented a novel multi-layer heterogeneous network-based approach, which incorporates the associations among diseases, genes and m6A RNA methylation sites from gene expression, RNA methylation and disease similarities data with the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a ten-fold cross validation is performed, in which our approach achieved a reasonable good performance (overall AUC: 0.827, average AUC 0.867), higher than a hypergeometric test-based approach (overall AUC: 0.7333 and average AUC: 0.723) and a random predictor (overall AUC: 0.550 and average AUC: 0.486). Additionally, we show that a number of predicted cancer-associated m6A sites are supported by existing literatures, suggesting that the proposed approach can effectively uncover the underlying epitranscriptome circuits of disease mechanisms.

PrediXcan has become one of the most widely used gene-based methods for testing associations between predicted gene expression values and a phenotype, which has facilitated novel insights into the relationship between complex traits and the component of gene expression that can be attributed to genetic variation. The gene expression prediction models for PrediXcan were developed using supervised machine learning methods and training data from the Depression Genes and Networks (DGN) study and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, where the majority of subjects are of European descent. Many genetic studies, however, include samples from multi-ethnic populations, and in this paper we evaluate the accuracy of PrediXcan for predicting gene expression in diverse populations. Using transcriptomic data from the GEUVADIS (Genetic European Variation in Disease) RNA sequencing project and whole genome sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes project, we evaluate and compare the predictive performance of PrediXcan in an African population (Yoruban) and four European ancestry populations for thousands of genes. We evaluate a range of models from the PrediXcan weight databases and use Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess gene expression prediction accuracy with PrediXcan. From our evaluation, we find that the predictive performance of PrediXcan varies substantially among populations from different continents (F-test p-value < 2.2 × 10-16), where prediction accuracy is lower in the Yoruban population from West Africa compared to the European-ancestry populations. Moreover, not only do we find differences in predictive performance between populations from different continents, we also find highly significant differences in prediction accuracy among the four European ancestry populations considered (F-test p-value < 2.2 × 10-16). Finally, while there is variability in prediction accuracy across different PrediXcan weight databases, we also find consistency in the qualitative performance of PrediXcan for the five populations considered, with the African ancestry population having the lowest accuracy across databases.",Decision Theory-Based COI-SNP Tagging Approach for 126 Scombriformes Species Tagging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001317,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 21,"The mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) is commonly used for DNA barcoding in animals. However, most of the COI barcode nucleotides are conserved and sequences longer than about 650 base pairs increase the computational burden for species identification. To solve this problem, we propose a decision theory-based COI SNP tagging (DCST) approach that focuses on the discrimination of species using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as the variable nucleotides of the sequences of a group of species. Using the example of 126 teleost mackerel fish species (order: Scombriformes), we identified 281 SNPs by alignment and trimming of their COI sequences. After decision rule making, 49 SNPs in 126 fish species were determined using the scoring system of the DCST approach. These COI-SNP barcodes were finally transformed into one-dimensional barcode images. Our proposed DCST approach simplifies the computational complexity and identifies the most effective and fewest SNPs to resolve or discriminate species for species tagging.",De novo Mutations From Whole Exome Sequencing in Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders: From Discovery to Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001316,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 21,"Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders are a highly disabling and heterogeneous group of developmental and mental disorders, resulting from complex interactions of genetic and environmental risk factors.

The development of next-generation sequencing, especially whole exome sequencing (WES), has greatly enriched our knowledge of the precise genetic alterations of human diseases, including brain-related disorders. In particular, the extensive usage of WES in research studies has uncovered the important contribution of de novo mutations (DNMs) to these disorders. Trio and quad familial WES are a particularly useful approach to discover DNMs. Here, we review the major WES studies in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and summarize how genes hit by discovered DNMs are shared among different disorders. Next, we discuss different integrative approaches utilized to interrogate DNMs and to identify biological pathways that may disrupt brain development and shed light on our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying these disorders. Lastly, we discuss the current state of the transition from WES research to its routine clinical application. This review will assist researchers and clinicians in the interpretation of variants obtained from WES studies, and highlights the need to develop consensus analytical protocols and validated lists of genes appropriate for clinical laboratory analysis, in order to reach the growing demands.",Multiple Epistasis Interactions Within MHC Are Associated With Ulcerative Colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001315,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 21,"Successful searching for epistasis is much challenging, which generally requires very large sample sizes and/or very dense marker information.

These signals were reduced substantially when conditional on the additive background, but still nine pairs remained significant at the Immunochip-wide level (P < 1.1 × 10-8) in conditional tests for UC. All these nine epistatic interactions come from the MHC region, and each explains on average 0.15% of the phenotypic variance. Eight of them were replicated in a replication cohort. There are multiple but relatively weak interactions independent of the additive effects within the MHC region for UC. Our promising results warrant the search for epistasis in large data sets with dense markers, exploiting dependencies between markers."

The biosynthesis of JAs occur sequentially in various subcellular compartments including the chloroplasts, peroxisomes and the cytoplasm. The biologically active jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) activates the core JA signaling in the nucleus by binding with its coreceptor, SCFCOI1-JAZ. Five members of a clade of ATP-binding cassette G (ABCG) transporters of Arabidopsis thaliana were identified as the candidates of jasmonate transporters (JATs) in yeast cells. Among these JATs, AtJAT1/AtABCG16, has a dual localization in the plasma membrane and nuclear envelop and mediates the efflux of jasmonic acid (JA) across the plasma membrane and influx of JA-Ile into the nucleus. Genetic, cellular and biochemical analyses have demonstrated that AtJAT1/AtABCG16 is crucial for modulating JA-Ile concentration in the nucleus to orchestrate JA signaling. AtJAT1 could also be involved in modulating the biosynthesis of JA-Ile by regulating the distribution of JA and JA-Ile in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which would contribute to the highly dynamic JA signaling. Furthermore, other JAT members are localized in the plasma membrane and possibly in peroxisomes. Characterization of these JATs will provide further insights into a crucial role of transporter-mediated subcellular distribution in the metabolism and signaling of plant hormones, an emerging theme supported by the identification of increasing number of endomembrane-localized transporters.",Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40 Is Required for Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Embryo Development in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001303,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"In eukaryotes, mitochondrion is an essential organelle which is surrounded by a double membrane system, including the outer membrane, intermembrane space and the inner membrane. The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex has attracted enormous interest for its role in importing the preprotein from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrion. However, little is understood about the potential biological function of the TOM complex in Arabidopsis. The aim of the present study was to investigate how AtTOM40, a gene encoding the core subunit of the TOM complex, works in Arabidopsis. As a result, we found that lack of AtTOM40 disturbed embryo development and its pattern formation after the globular embryo stage, and finally caused albino ovules and seed abortion at the ratio of a quarter in the homozygous tom40 plants. Further investigation demonstrated that AtTOM40 is wildly expressed in different tissues, especially in cotyledons primordium during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. Moreover, we confirmed that the encoded protein AtTOM40 is localized in mitochondrion, and the observation of the ultrastructure revealed that mitochondrion biogenesis was impaired in tom40-1 embryo cells. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to determine the expression of genes encoding outer mitochondrial membrane proteins in the homozygous tom40-1 mutant embryos, including the genes known to be involved in import, assembly and transport of mitochondrial proteins, and the results demonstrated that most of the gene expressions were abnormal. Similarly, the expression of genes relevant to embryo development and pattern formation, such as SAM (shoot apical meristem), cotyledon, vascular primordium and hypophysis, was also affected in homozygous tom40-1 mutant embryos. Taken together, we draw the conclusion that the AtTOM40 gene is essential for the normal structure of the mitochondrion, and participates in early embryo development and pattern formation through maintaining the biogenesis of mitochondria. The findings of this study may provide new insight into the biological function of the TOM40 subunit in higher plants.",Present Scenario of Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001302,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are new endogenous non-coding RNA family members that arise during pre-mRNA splicing in a reversed order in which the 3' and 5' ends are covalently closed. Compared to the comprehensive investigation of circRNAs in animals, circRNA research in plants is still in its infancy. Genome-wide identification and characterization of circRNAs have recently been performed in several plant species. CircRNAs are ubiquitously expressed and abundant in plants. The expression of circRNAs is often dependent on cell-type, tissue, and developmental stage, and it is particularly stress-inducible in plants. CircRNAs might play important roles in various biological processes in plants, including development and the response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we review the current literature and provide a brief overview of circRNAs and their research status in plants, as well as the bioinformatic tools and database resources for circRNA analysis.",Overcoming Self-Incompatibility in Diploid Potato Using CRISPR-Cas9.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001300,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"Potato breeding can be redirected to a diploid inbred/F1 hybrid variety breeding strategy if self-compatibility can be introduced into diploid germplasm. However, the majority of diploid potato clones (Solanum spp.) possess gametophytic self-incompatibility that is primarily controlled by a single multiallelic locus called the S-locus which is composed of tightly linked genes, S-RNase (S-locus RNase) and multiple SLFs (S-locus F-box proteins), which are expressed in the style and pollen, respectively. Using S-RNase genes known to function in the Solanaceae gametophytic SI mechanism, we identified S-RNase alleles with flower-specific expression in two diploid self-incompatible potato lines using genome resequencing data. Consistent with the location of the S-locus in potato, we genetically mapped the S-RNase gene using a segregating population to a region of low recombination within the pericentromere of chromosome 1. To generate self-compatible diploid potato lines, a dual single-guide RNA (sgRNA) strategy was used to target conserved exonic regions of the S-RNase gene and generate targeted knockouts (KOs) using a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) approach. Self-compatibility was achieved in nine S-RNase KO T0 lines which contained bi-allelic and homozygous deletions/insertions in both genotypes, transmitting self compatibility to T1 progeny. This study demonstrates an efficient approach to achieve stable, consistent self-compatibility through S-RNase KO for use in diploid potato breeding approaches.",Generation and Characterization of a Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica) Mutant Library.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001298,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is attractive to plant scientists as a model plant because of several distinct characteristics, such as its short stature, rapid life cycle, sufficient seed production per plant, self-compatibility, true diploid nature, high photosynthetic efficiency, small genome size, and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. However, the study on the genetic resources of foxtail millet largely lag behind those of the other model plants such as Arabidopsis, rice and maize. Mutagenized populations cannot only create new germplasm resources, but also provide materials for gene function research. In this manuscript, an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced foxtail millet population comprising ∼15,000 individual M1 lines was established. Total 1353 independent lines with diverse abnormal phenotypes of leaf color, plant morphologies and panicle shapes were identified in M2. Resequencing of sixteen randomly selected M2 plants showed an average estimated mutation density of 1 loci/213 kb. Moreover, we provided an example for rapid cloning of the WP1 gene by a map-based cloning method. A white panicle mutant, named as wp1.a, exhibited significantly reduced chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid contents in leaf and panicle. Map-based cloning results showed an eight-base pair deletion located at the sixth exon of wp1.a in LOC101786849, which caused the premature termination. WP1 encoded phytoene synthase. Moreover, the sequencing analysis and cross test verified that a white panicle mutant wp1.b was an allelic mutant of wp1.a. The filed phenotypic observation and gene cloning example showed that our foxtail millet EMS-induced mutant population would be used as an important resource for functional genomics studies of foxtail millet.",Molecular Mechanisms of Tungsten Toxicity Differ for Glycine max Depending on Nitrogen Regime.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001297,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"Tungsten (W) finds increasing application in military, aviation and household appliance industry, opening new paths into the environment. Since W shares certain chemical properties with the essential plant micronutrient molybdenum (Mo), it is proposed to inhibit enzymatic activity of molybdoenzymes [e.g., nitrate reductase (NR)] by replacing the Mo-ion bound to the co-factor. Recent studies suggest that W, much like other heavy metals, also exerts toxicity on its own. To create a comprehensive picture of tungsten stress, this study investigated the effects of W on growth and metabolism of soybean (Glycine max), depending on plant nitrogen regime [nitrate fed (N fed) vs. symbiotic N2 fixation (N fix)] by combining plant physiological data (biomass production, starch and nutrient content, N2 fixation, nitrate reductase activity) with root and nodule proteome data. Irrespective of N regime, NR activity and total N decreased with increasing W concentrations. Nodulation and therefore also N2 fixation strongly declined at high W concentrations, particularly in N fix plants. However, N2 fixation rate (g N fixed g-1 nodule dwt) remained unaffected by increasing W concentrations. Proteomic analysis revealed a strong decline in leghemoglobin and nitrogenase precursor levels (NifD), as well as an increase in abundance of proteins involved in secondary metabolism in N fix nodules. Taken together this indicates that, in contrast to the reported direct inhibition of NR, N2 fixation appears to be indirectly inhibited by a decrease in nitrogenase synthesis due to W induced changes in nodule oxygen levels of N fix plants. Besides N metabolism, plants exhibited a strong reduction of shoot (both N regimes) and root (N fed only) biomass, an imbalance in nutrient levels and a failure of carbon metabolic pathways accompanied by an accumulation of starch at high tungsten concentrations, independent of N-regime. Proteomic data (available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010877) demonstrated that the response to high W concentrations was independent of nodule functionality and dominated by several peroxidases and other general stress related proteins. Based on an evaluation of several W responsive proteotypic peptides, we identified a set of protein markers of W stress and possible targets for improved stress tolerance.",Flavonoid Glycosides and Hydroxycinnamic Acid Derivatives in Baby Leaf Rapeseed From White and Yellow Flowering Cultivars With Repeated Harvest in a 2-Years Field Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001295,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"Recently, new annual and biennial cultivars of rapeseed with white flowers have been introduced to the baby leaf market. The white flower trait has been bred into modern cultivars of yellow flowering rapeseed. In baby leaf production, it is common practice to perform several cuts of the same plants, thereby harvesting regrown material. Seven white and yellow flowering annual and biennial rapeseed cultivars were harvested as baby leaves, baby leaf re-growths, and intact plants in order to investigate the content of flavonoid glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The field experiment was conducted over two consecutive years to obtain seasonal differences. The yields and levels of flavonoid glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acids were higher in 2016 than 2017, due to higher temperatures and radiation. Within the growing stage, the effects of flower color, cultivar, and life cycle on flavonoid glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acids varied; however, in general, life cycle was the main influence that resulted in elevated levels of flavonoid glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acids in biennial cultivars, compared to annual cultivars. The effects of the growing stage differed between years, and were influenced by climatic conditions. In conclusion, the choice of life cycle (annual or biennial cultivars) and seasonal effects was of major influence, overruling the effect of developmental stage on the content of flavonoid glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acids.",Methylation at the C-3' in D-Ring of Strigolactone Analogs Reduces Biological Activity in Root Parasitic Plants and Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001294,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"Strigolactones (SLs) regulate plant development and induce seed germination in obligate root parasitic weeds, e.g. Striga spp. Because organic synthesis of natural SLs is laborious, there is a large need for easy-to-synthesize and efficient analogs. Here, we investigated the effect of a structural modification of the D-ring, a conserved structural element in SLs. We synthesized and investigated the activity of two analogs, MP13 and MP26, which differ from previously published AR8 and AR36 only in the absence of methylation at C-3'. The de-methylated MP13 and MP26 were much more efficient in regulating plant development and inducing Striga seed germination, compared with AR8. Hydrolysis assays performed with purified Striga SL receptor and docking of AR8 and MP13 to the corresponding active site confirmed and explained the higher activity. Field trials performed in a naturally Striga-infested African farmer's field unraveled MP13 as a promising candidate for combating Striga by inducing germination in host's absence. Our findings demonstrate that methylation of the C-3' in D-ring in SL analogs has a negative impact on their activity and identify MP13 and, particularly, MP26 as potent SL analogs with simple structures, which can be employed to control Striga, a major threat to global food security.",Architecture and Florogenesis in Female Cannabis sativa Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001293,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"The inflorescence is the main product of medical cannabis. Hundreds of specialized metabolites with potential bioactivity are produced and accumulated in the glandular trichomes that are highly abundant mainly on female inflorescences. Understanding the morphophysiological and genetic mechanisms governing flower and inflorescence development is therefore of high scientific and practical importance. However, in-depth investigations of cannabis florogenesis are limited. Cannabis producers and researchers consider long photoperiod to be ""non-inductive"" or ""vegetative,"" but under these growth conditions, the development of solitary flowers and bracts in shoot internodes clearly indicates that the plant cannot be defined as vegetative or non-inductive in the classical sense. Most probably, induction of solitary flowers is age-dependent and controlled by internal signals, but not by photoperiod. Short photoperiod induces intense branching, which results in the development of a compound raceme. Each inflorescence consists of condensed branchlets with the same phytomer structure as that of the larger phytomers developed under long day. Each phytomer consists of reduced leaves, bracts, one or two solitary flowers, and an axillary shoot (or inflorescence). Therefore, the effect of short photoperiod on cannabis florogenesis is not flower induction, but rather a dramatic change in shoot apex architecture to form a compound racemose inflorescence structure. An understanding of the morphophysiological characteristics of cannabis inflorescence will lay the foundation for biotechnological and physiological applications to modify architecture and to maximize plant productivity and uniformity in medical Cannabis.",The Altered Expression of microRNA408 Influences the Arabidopsis Response to Iron Deficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001291,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 21,"MicroRNAs contribute to the adaptation of plants to varying environmental conditions by affecting systemic mineral nutrient homeostasis. Copper and iron deficiencies antagonistically control the expression of Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA408 (miR408), which post-transcriptionally regulates laccase-like multicopper oxidase family members LAC3, LAC12, and LAC13. In this work, we used miR408 T-DNA insertion mutants (408-KO1 and 408-KO2) and a previously characterized transgenic line overexpressing miR408 (35S:408-14) to explore how miR408 influences copper- and iron-dependent metabolism. We observed that the altered expression of miR408 diminished plant performance and the activation of the iron-regulated genes under iron-deficient conditions. Consistently with the low expression of the miR408-target laccases, we showed that the vascular bundle lignification of the 35S:408-14 plants diminished. The decrease in the phenoloxidase and ferroxidase activities exhibited by wild-type plants under iron deficiency did not occur in the 408-KO1 plants, probably due to the higher expression of laccases. Finally, we observed that the hydrogen peroxide levels under iron starvation were altered in both the 408-KO1 and 35S:408-14 lines. Taken together, these results suggest that Arabidopsis plants with modified miR408 levels undergo multiple deregulations under iron-deficient conditions."

Sterile inflammation occurs after both stroke subtypes and contributes to neuronal injury and damage to the blood-brain barrier with release of brain antigens and a potential induction of autoimmune responses that escape central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. In stroke patients, the detection of T cells and antibodies specific to neuronal antigens suggests a role of humoral adaptive immunity. In experimental models stroke leads to a significant increase of autoreactive T and B cells to CNS antigens. Lesion volume and functional outcome in stroke patients and murine stroke models are connected to antigen-specific responses to brain proteins. In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) a range of antibodies against brain proteins can be detected in serum samples. In this review, we will summarize the role of autoimmunity in post-lesional conditions and discuss the role of B and T cells and their potential neuroprotective or detrimental effects.",Traumatic Injury and Exposure to Mitochondrial-Derived Damage Associated Molecular Patterns Suppresses Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001279,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Major traumatic injury induces significant remodeling of the circulating neutrophil pool and loss of bactericidal function. Although a well-described phenomenon, research to date has only analyzed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission, and the mechanisms that initiate compromised neutrophil function post-injury are therefore poorly understood. Here, we analyzed pre-hospital blood samples acquired from 62 adult trauma patients (mean age 44 years, range 19-95 years) within 1 h of injury (mean time to sample 39 min, range 13-59 min). We found an immediate impairment in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, which persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4-72 h). Reduced NET generation was accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species production, impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and a reduction in neutrophil glucose uptake and metabolism to lactate. Pre-treating neutrophils from healthy subjects with mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), whose circulating levels were significantly increased in our trauma patients, reduced NET generation. This mtDAMP-induced impairment in NET formation was associated with an N-formyl peptide mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis and NET formation. Indeed, activation of AMPK via treatment with the AMP-mimetic AICAR significantly reduced neutrophil lactate production in response to PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that we also observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, the impairment in NET generation induced by mtDAMPs was partially ameliorated by pre-treating neutrophils with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken together, our data demonstrate an immediate trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil anti-microbial function and identify mtDAMP release as a potential initiator of acute post-injury neutrophil dysfunction.",Immunology's Coming of Age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001278,Frontiers in immunology,2019 06 15,"This treatise describes the development of immunology as a scientific discipline with a focus on its foundation. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the study of immunology was founded with the discoveries of phagocytosis by Elias Metchnikoff, as well as by Emil Behring's and Paul Ehrlich's discovery of neutralizing antibodies. These seminal studies were followed by the discoveries of bacteriolysis by complement and of opsonization by antibodies, which provided first evidence for cooperation between acquired and innate immunity. In the years that followed, light was shed on the pathogenic corollary of the immune response, describing different types of hypersensitivity. Subsequently, immunochemistry dominated the field, leading to the revelation of the chemical structure of antibodies in the 1960s. Immunobiology was preceded by transplantation biology, which laid the ground for the genetic basis of acquired immunity. With the identification of antibody producers as B lymphocytes and the discovery of T lymphocytes as regulators of acquired immunity, lymphocytes moved into the center of immunologic research. T cells were shown to be genetically restricted and to regulate different leukocyte populations, including B cells and professional phagocytes. The discovery of dendritic cells as major antigen-presenting cells and their surface expression of pattern recognition receptors revealed the mechanisms by which innate immunity instructs acquired immunity. Genetic analysis provided in-depth insights into the generation of antibody diversity by recombination, which in principle was shown to underlie diversity of the T cell receptor, as well. The invention of monoclonal antibodies not only provided ultimate proof for the unique antigen specificity of the antibody-producing plasma cell, it also paved the way for a new era of immunotherapy. Emil Behring demonstrated cure of infectious disease by serum therapy, illustrating how clinical studies can stimulate basic research. The recent discovery of checkpoint control for cancer therapy illustrates how clinical application benefits from insights into basic mechanisms. Last not least, perspectives on immunology progressed from a dichotomy between cellular-unspecific innate immunity and humoral-specific acquired immunity, toward the concept of complementary binarity.",Osteoimmunology of Bone Loss in Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001277,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Over the past two decades, the field of osteoimmunology has emerged in response to a range of evidence demonstrating the reciprocal relationship between the immune system and bone. In particular, localized bone loss, in the form of joint erosions and periarticular osteopenia, as well as systemic osteoporosis, caused by inflammatory rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, the prototype of inflammatory arthritis has highlighted the importance of this interplay. Osteoclast-mediated resorption at the interface between synovium and bone is responsible for the joint erosion seen in patients suffering from inflammatory arthritis. Clinical studies have helped to validate the impact of several pathways on osteoclast formation and activity. Essentially, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor κB Ligand (RANKL) is, both directly and indirectly, increased by T cells, stimulating osteoclastogenesis and resorption through a crucial regulator of immunity, the Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Furthermore, in rheumatoid arthritis, autoantibodies, which are accurate predictors both of the disease and associated structural damage, have been shown to stimulate the differentiation of osteoclasts, resulting in localized bone resorption. It is now also evident that osteoblast-mediated bone formation is impaired by inflammation both in joints and the skeleton in rheumatoid arthritis. This review summarizes the substantial progress that has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of bone loss in inflammatory rheumatic disease and highlights therapeutic targets potentially important for the cure or at least an alleviation of this destructive process.",Induction of Fc-Mediated Effector Functions Against a Stabilized Inner Domain of HIV-1 gp120 Designed to Selectively Harbor the A32 Epitope Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001276,Frontiers in immunology,2019 06 13,"Recent clinical trials and studies using nonhuman primates (NHPs) suggest that antibody-mediated protection against HIV-1 will require α-HIV envelope humoral immunity beyond direct neutralization to include Fc-receptor (FcR) mediated effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). There is also strong evidence indicating that the most potent ADCC response in humans is directed toward transitional non-neutralizing epitopes associated with the gp41-interactive face of gp120, particularly those within the first and second constant (C1-C2) region (A32-like epitopes). These epitopes were shown to be major targets of ADCC responses during natural infection and have been implicated in vaccine-induced protective immunity. Here we describe the immunogenicity of ID2, an immunogen consisting of the inner domain of the clade A/E 93TH057 HIV-1 gp120 expressed independently of the outer domain (OD) and stabilized in the CD4-bound conformation to harbor conformational A32 region epitopes within a minimal structural unit of HIV-1 Env. ID2 induced A32-specific antibody responses in BALB/c mice when injected alone or in the presence of the adjuvants Alum or GLA-SE. Low α-ID2 titers were detected in mice immunized with ID2 alone whereas robust responses were observed with ID2 plus adjuvant, with the greatest ID2 and A32-specific titers observed in the GLA-SE group. Only sera from groups immunized in the presence of GLA-SE were capable of mediating significant ADCC using NKr cells sensitized with recombinant BaL gp120 as targets and human PBMCs as effectors. A neutralization response to a tier 2 virus was not observed. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that ID2 is highly immunogenic and elicits A32-specific ADCC responses in an animal host. The ID2 immunogen has significant translational value as it can be used in challenge studies to evaluate the role of non-neutralizing antibodies directed at the A32 subregion in HIV-1 protection.",Food-Induced Anaphylaxis: Role of Hidden Allergens and Cofactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001275,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Food anaphylaxis is on the increase, with those who have an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, milk, and seafood at the highest risk of developing such a reaction. However, the diet in many societies is increasingly varied, much of the food consumed is prepared outside the home, and meals are often composed of many different ingredients. Anaphylaxis may occur to a composite food, and it may be unclear whether the reaction is due to contamination or to a culprit allergen present in an added ingredient. Composite foods can contain many allergic proteins present in small amounts, which do not always have to be labeled, unless they feature in European or US labeling regulations. These ""hidden"" allergens include mustard, celery, spices, lupine, pea, natural food colourings, and preservatives, but can occasionally include allergenic material from contaminants such as cereal mites. Hidden allergens can provoke severe reactions to seemingly unconnected foods which might then lead to a diagnosis of idiopathic anaphylaxis. The same problem can arise with two well-known types of food allergy; wheat-dependant exercise induced anaphylaxis and allergy to non-specific Lipid Transfer Protein allergens, both of which might only manifest when linked to a cofactor such as exercise. Many of these risk factors for food anaphylaxis have a common link; the public's engagement with popular concepts of health and fitness. This includes the development of a food and exercise culture involving the promotion and marketing of foods for their health-giving properties i.e., meat substitutes, wheat substitutes, supplements and alternative, or ""natural"" remedies for common ailments. Some of these foods have been reported as the cause of severe allergic reactions, but because they are often viewed as benign unlikely causes of severe allergic reactions, could be considered to be hidden allergens. The best resource to elicit the likelihood of a hidden allergen provoking an allergic reaction is to take a detailed history of the allergic reaction, presence of co-factors, foods suspected, type of food and where it was consumed. A good knowledge of commonly used ingredients, and list of potential hidden allergen suspects are essential tools for the food allergy detective.",Complement Therapeutics in Autoimmune Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001274,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 22,"Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by generation of autoantibodies that bind to host proteins or deposit within tissues as a component of immune complexes. The autoantibodies can activate the complement system, which can mediate tissue damage and trigger systemic inflammation. Complement inhibitory drugs may, therefore, be beneficial across a large number of different autoimmune diseases. Many new anti-complement drugs that target specific activation mechanisms or downstream activation fragments are in development. Based on the shared pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases, some of these complement inhibitory drugs may provide benefit across multiple different diseases. In some antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, however, unique features of the autoantibodies, the target antigens, or the affected tissues may make it advantageous to block individual components or pathways of the complement system. This paper reviews the evidence that complement is involved in various autoimmune diseases, as well as the studies that have examined whether or not complement inhibitors are effective for treating these diseases.",Complement in Metastasis: A Comp in the Camp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001273,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"The complement system represents a pillar of the innate immune response.

The multistep process of metastasis entails the acquisition of advantageous functions required for the formation of secondary tumors. Thus, targeting components of the complement system could impact not only on tumor initiation but also on several crucial steps along tumor dissemination. This novel vulnerability could be concomitantly exploited with current strategies overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression to provide a substantial clinical benefit in the treatment of metastatic disease.

SATB1 plays a crucial role in expression of multiple genes throughout the thymic development and peripheral differentiation of T cells. Although SATB1 function has been subjected to intense investigation, regulation of SATB1 gene expression remains poorly understood. Analysis of RNA-seq data revealed multiple transcription start sites at the upstream regulatory region of SATB1. We further demonstrated that SATB1 gene is expressed via alternative promoters during T-helper (Th) cell differentiation. The proximal promoter ""P1"" is used more by the naïve and activated CD4+ T-cells whereas the middle ""P2"" and the distal ""P3"" promoters are used at a significantly higher level by polarized T-helper cells. Cytokine and TCR signaling play crucial roles toward SATB1 alternative promoter usage. Under Th2 polarization conditions, transcription factor STAT6, which operates downstream of the cytokine signaling binds to the P2 and P3 promoters. Genetic perturbation by knockout and chemical inhibition of STAT6 activation resulted in the loss of P2 and P3 promoter activity. Moreover, chemical inhibition of activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that operates downstream of the TCR signaling, also resulted in reduced P2 and P3 promoter usage. Furthermore, usage of the P1 promoter correlated with lower SATB1 protein expression whereas P2 and P3 promoter usage correlated with higher SATB1 protein expression. Thus, the promoter switch might play a crucial role in fine-tuning of SATB1 protein expression in a cell type specific manner.","Oral Administration of Compound Probiotics Improved Canine Feed Intake, Weight Gain, Immunity and Intestinal Microbiota.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001271,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Probiotics have been used successfully to promote human and animal health, but only limited studies have focused on using probiotics to improve the health of hosts of different age. Canine microbiome studies may be predictive of results in humans because of the high structural and functional similarity between dog and human microbiomes. A total of 90 dogs were divided into three groups based on dog age (elderly group, n = 30; young group, n = 24; and training group, n = 36). Each group was subdivided into two subgroups, with and without receiving daily probiotic feed additive. The probiotic feed additive contained three different bacterial strains, namely Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P-8, and Bifdobacterium animalis subsp. lactis V9. Serum and fecal samples were collected and analyzed at four different time points, i.e., days 0, 30, and 60 of probiotic treatment, and 15 days after ceasing probiotic treatment. The results demonstrated that probiotics significantly promoted the average daily feed intake of the elderly dogs (P < 0.01) and the average daily weight gain of all dogs (P < 0.05), enhanced the level of serum IgG (P < 0.001), IFN-α (P < 0.05), and fecal SIgA (P < 0.001), while reduced the TNF-α (P < 0.05). Additionally, probiotics could change the gut microbial structure of elderly dogs and significantly increased beneficial bacteria (including some Lactobacillus species and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and decreased potentially harmful bacteria (including Escherichia coli and Sutterella stercoricanisin), and the elderly dogs showed the strongest response to the probiotics; the relative abundance of some of these species correlated with certain immune factors and physiological parameters, suggesting that the probiotic treatment improved the host health and enhanced the host immunity by stimulating antibody and cytokine secretion through regulating canine gut microbiota. Furthermore, the gut microbiota of the elderly dogs shifted toward a younger-like composition at day 60 of probiotic treatment. Our findings suggested that the probiotic treatment effects on canine health and immunity were age-related and have provided interesting insights into future development of probiotic-based strategies to improve animal and human health."

We then examine these pieces individually and in combinations using this information to determine the outcome of future similar events and the likelihood of their recurrence. Practically, this attempt to foretell an occurrence and predict its outcomes is evident in multiple disciplines ranging from meteorology to sociologic studies. In this manuscript we share the historical and present-day tools to predict course and outcome in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy including clinical features, testing, and biomarkers. Further we discuss considerations for building more complex predictive models of outcome especially in diseases such as juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy where patients numbers are low. Many of the barriers to developing risk prediction models for juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy outcomes have improved with many remaining challenges being addressed.",A Variant of the Histone-Binding Protein sNASP Contributes to Mouse Lupus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001259,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 22,"The Sle2c1rec1c (rec1c) sublocus is derived from the mouse lupus susceptibility 2 (Sle2) locus identified in the NZM2410 model. Our current study dissected the functional characters and the genetic basis of the rec1c locus relative to lupus when co-expressed with the Fas 
lpr
 mutation, an established inducer of autoimmunity. The rec1c.lpr mice exhibited mild expansion of lymph nodes and had a normal T cell cellularity, but developed significantly kidney and lung inflammation, indicating that the rec1c amplifies lpr-induced autoimmune pathogenesis. A variant of somatic nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (sNASP) was identified from the rec1c interval as a substitution of two consecutive amino acid residues in the histone-binding domain, resulting in an increased binding affinity to histone H4 and H3.1/H4 tetramer. To determine the role of the sNASP rec1c allele in mouse lupus, a novel strain was generated by introducing the rec1c mutations into the B6 genome. In this transgenic model, the sNASP allele synergized with the lpr mutation leading to moderate autoimmune phenotypes and aggravating inflammatory pathology alterations in kidney and lung that were similar to those observed in the rec1c.lpr mice. These results establish that the sNASP allele is a pathogenic genetic element in the rec1c sublocus, which not only promotes autoimmunity, but also exacerbates the inflammation reaction of end organs in mouse lupus pathogenesis. It also shows the complexity of the Sle2c locus, initially mapped as the major locus associated with B1a cell expansion. In addition to Cdkn2c, which regulates this expansion, we have now identified in the same locus a protective allele of Csf3r, a variant of Skint6 associated with T cell activation, and now a variant of sNASP that amplifies autoimmunity and tissue damage.",Proinflammatory Cytokine Gene Polymorphisms in Bullous Pemphigoid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001258,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare autoimmune skin blistering disease, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal autoantigens. Cytokine expression is altered in BP patients, and several of these differently expressed cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α, contribute to disease pathogenesis. Since genetic polymorphisms in the genes of these cytokines might be implicated in susceptibility to BP disease, we aimed at testing this implication in susceptibility to BP in an Iranian cohort. Blood samples were collected from the subjects and genomic DNA was extracted. To detect the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), IL-1α (rs1800587), IL-1β (rs1143627, rs16944, rs1143634), IL-8 (rs4073), and TNF-α (rs1799964, rs1800630, rs1799724, and rs361525) genes were genotyped in BP patients and healthy controls as well as IL-8 (rs4073) in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients. Quantitative gene expression was evaluated by RT-PCR analysis. A significant difference was observed in the distribution of genotypes or alleles of IL-8 SNP between the BP patients and controls. The A-allele of IL-8 SNP is significantly more prevalent in the control individuals compared to the BP patient. To further validate this observation, we included PV patients as an additional control. Again, the A-allele of IL-8 SNP is significantly more prevalent in the PV compared to the BP patients. While we observed a trend toward significant differences regarding alleles of TNF-α rs1799724 as well as alleles of TNF-α rs1799964, this difference was, however, not evident after correction for multiple analysis. There was no significant difference in all other studied SNPs. In contrast to IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α, IL-8 gene expression levels were significantly higher in the patients than that of controls. The minor allele in IL-8 SNP might play a protective role in susceptibility to BP in Iranian patients. Although higher expression levels of IL-8 gene was found in the patients compared with healthy controls, these levels, however, suggest no association with the examined polymorphism. Moreover, further investigation revealed an elevation in gene expression between wild and polymorphic genotypes of IL-1α rs1800587 and TNF-α rs361525 in the patient group and these SNPs are therefore associated with altering the levels of gene expression.",Soluble CD83 Triggers Resolution of Arthritis and Sustained Inflammation Control in IDO Dependent Manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001257,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Interference with autoimmune-mediated cytokine production is a key yet poorly developed approach to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Herein, we show that soluble CD83 (sCD83) enhances the resolution of autoimmune antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) by strongly reducing the expression levels of cytokines such as IL-17A, IFNγ, IL-6, and TNFα within the joints. Noteworthy, also the expression of RANKL, osteoclast differentiation, and joint destruction was significantly inhibited by sCD83. In addition, osteoclasts which were cultured in the presence of synovial T cells, derived from sCD83 treated AIA mice, showed a strongly reduced number of multinuclear large osteoclasts compared to mock controls. Enhanced resolution of arthritis by sCD83 was mechanistically based on IDO, since inhibition of IDO by 1-methyltryptophan completely abrogated sCD83 effects on AIA. Blocking experiments, using anti-TGF-β antibodies further revealed that also TGF-β is mechanistically involved in the sCD83 induced reduction of bone destruction and cartilage damage as well as enhanced resolution of inflammation. Resolution of arthritis was associated with increased numbers of regulatory T cells, which are induced in a sCD83-IDO-TGF-β dependent manner. Taken together, sCD83 represents an interesting approach for downregulating cytokine production, inducing regulatory T cells and inducing resolution of autoimmune arthritis.",Memory T Cells in Pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001255,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Adaptations of the maternal immune response are necessary for pregnancy success. Insufficient immune adaption is associated with pregnancy pathologies such as infertility, recurrent miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, spontaneous preterm birth, and preeclampsia. The maternal immune system is continuously exposed to paternal-fetal antigens; through semen exposure from before pregnancy, through fetal cell exposure in pregnancy, and through microchimerism after pregnancy. This results in the generation of paternal-fetal antigen specific memory T cells. Memory T cells have the ability to remember previously encountered antigens to elicit a quicker, more substantial and focused immune response upon antigen reencounter. Such fetal antigen specific memory T cells could be unfavorable in pregnancy as they could potentially drive fetal rejection. However, knowledge on memory T cells in pregnancy has shown that these cells might play a favorable role in fetal-maternal tolerance rather than rejection of the fetus. In recent years, various aspects of immunologic memory in pregnancy have been elucidated and the relevance and working mechanisms of paternal-fetal antigen specific memory T cells in pregnancy have been evaluated. The data indicate that a delicate balance of memory T cells seems necessary for reproductive success and that immunologic memory in reproduction might not be harmful for pregnancy. This review provides an overview of the different memory T cell subtypes and their function in the physiology and in complications of pregnancy. Current findings in the field and possible therapeutic targets are discussed. The findings of our review raise new research questions for further studies regarding the role of memory T cells in immune-associated pregnancy complications. These studies are needed for the identification of possible targets related to memory mechanisms for studies on preventive therapies.",Donor Allospecific CD44high Central Memory T Cells Have Decreased Ability to Mediate Graft-vs.-Host Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001254,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Data from both animal models and humans have demonstrated that effector memory T cells (TEM) and central memory T cells (TCM) from unprimed donors have decreased ability to induce graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Allospecific TEM from primed donors do not mediate GVHD. However, the potential of alloreactive TCM to induce GVHD is not clear. In this study, we sought to answer this question using a novel GVHD model induced by T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic OT-II T cells. Separated from OT-II mice immunized with OVA protein 8 weeks earlier, the allospecific CD44high TCM were able to mediate skin graft rejection after transfer to naive mice, yet had dramatically decreased ability to induce GVHD. We also found that these allospecific CD44high TCM persisted in GVHD target organs for more than 30 days post-transplantation, while the expansion of these cells was dramatically decreased during GVHD, suggesting an anergic or exhausted state. These observations provide insights into how allospecific CD4+ TCM respond to alloantigen during GVHD and underscore the fundamental difference of alloresponses mediated by allospecific TCM in graft rejection and GVHD settings.",Dual Role of CD4 in Peripheral T Lymphocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001252,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"The interaction of T-cell receptors (TCRs) with self- and non-self-peptides in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) stimulates crucial signaling events, which in turn can activate T lymphocytes. A variety of accessory molecules further modulate T-cell signaling. Of these, the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors make the most critical contributions to T cell sensitivity in vivo. Whereas, CD4 function in T cell development is well-characterized, its role in peripheral T cells remains incompletely understood. It was originally suggested that CD4 stabilizes weak interactions between TCRs and peptides in the MHC and delivers Lck kinases to that complex. The results of numerous experiments support the latter role, indicating that the CD4-Lck complex accelerates TCR-triggered signaling and controls the availability of the kinase for TCR in the absence of the ligand. On the other hand, extremely low affinity of CD4 for MHC rules out its ability to stabilize the receptor-ligand complex. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on CD4 in T cells, with a special emphasis on the spatio-temporal organization of early signaling events and the relevance for CD4 function. We further highlight the capacity of CD4 to interact with the MHC in the absence of TCR. It drives the adhesion of T cells to the cells that express the MHC. This process is facilitated by the CD4 accumulation in the tips of microvilli on the surface of unstimulated T cells. Based on these observations, we suggest an alternative model of CD4 role in T-cell activation.",Soybean Meal-Induced Intestinal Inflammation in Zebrafish Is T Cell-Dependent and Has a Th17 Cytokine Profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001250,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Currently, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a serious public health problem on the rise worldwide. In this work, we utilized the zebrafish to introduce a new model of intestinal inflammation triggered by food intake. Taking advantage of the translucency of the larvae and the availability of transgenic zebrafish lines with fluorescently labeled macrophages, neutrophils, or lymphocytes, we studied the behavior of these cell types in vivo during the course of inflammation. We established two feeding strategies, the first using fish that were not previously exposed to food (naïve strategy) and the second in which fish were initially exposed to normal food (developed strategy). In both strategies, we analyzed the effect of subsequent intake of a control or a soybean meal diet. Our results showed increased numbers of innate immune cells in the gut in both the naïve or developed protocols. Likewise, macrophages underwent drastic morphological changes after feeding, switching from a small and rounded contour to a larger and dendritic shape. Lymphocytes colonized the intestine as early as 5 days post fertilization and increased in numbers during the inflammatory process. Gene expression analysis indicated that lymphocytes present in the intestine correspond to T helper cells. Interestingly, control diet only induced a regulatory T cell profile in the developed model. On the contrary, soybean meal diet induced a Th17 response both in naïve and developed model. In addition, when feeding was performed in rag1-deficient fish, intestinal inflammation was not induced indicating that inflammation induced by soybean meal is T cell-dependent.",Targeted APC Activation in Cancer Immunotherapy to Enhance the Abscopal Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001249,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 22,"In oncology, the ""abscopal effect"" refers to the therapeutic effect on a distant tumor resulting from the treatment of local tumor (e. g., ablation, injection, or radiation). Typically associated with radiation, the abscopal effect is thought to be mediated by a systemic antitumor immune response that is induced by two concurrent changes at the treated tumor: (1) the release of tumor antigens and (2) the exposure of damage-associated molecular patterns. Therapies that produce these changes are associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD). Some interventions have been shown to cause an abscopal effect without inducing the release of tumor antigens, suggesting that release of tumor antigens at baseline plays a significant role in mediating the abscopal effect. With tumor antigens already present, therapies that target activation of APCs alone may be sufficient to enhance the abscopal effect. Here, we discuss two therapies targeted at APC activation, TLR9 and CD40 agonists, and their use in the clinic to enhance the abscopal effect.",Evaluation of in vitro Assays to Assess the Modulation of Dendritic Cells Functions by Therapeutic Antibodies and Aggregates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001248,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 21,"Therapeutic antibodies have the potential to induce immunogenicity leading to the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) that consequently may result in reduced serum drug concentrations, a loss of efficacy or potential hypersensitivity reactions. Among other factors, aggregated antibodies have been suggested to promote immunogenicity, thus enhancing ADA production. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most efficient antigen-presenting cell population and are crucial for the initiation of T cell responses and the subsequent generation of an adaptive immune response. This work focuses on the development of predictive in vitro assays that can monitor DC maturation, in order to determine whether drug products have direct DC stimulatory capabilities. To this end, four independent laboratories aligned a common protocol to differentiate human monocyte-derived DC (moDC) that were treated with either native or aggregated preparations of infliximab, natalizumab, adalimumab, or rituximab. These drug products were subjected to different forms of physical stress, heat and shear, resulting in aggregation and the formation of subvisible particles. Each partner developed and optimized assays to monitor diverse end-points of moDC maturation: measuring the upregulation of DC activation markers via flow cytometry, analyzing cytokine, and chemokine production via mRNA and protein quantification and identifying cell signaling pathways via quantification of protein phosphorylation. These study results indicated that infliximab, with the highest propensity to form aggregates when heat-stressed, induced a marked activation of moDC as measured by an increase in CD83 and CD86 surface expression, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNFα, CCL3, and CCL4 transcript upregulation and release of respective proteins, and phosphorylation of the intracellular signaling proteins Syk, ERK1/2, and Akt. In contrast, natalizumab, which does not aggregate under these stress conditions, induced no DC activation in any assay system, whereas adalimumab or rituximab aggregates induced only slight parameter variation. Importantly, the data generated in the different assay systems by each partner site correlated and supported the use of these assays to monitor drug-intrinsic propensities to drive maturation of DC. This moDC assay is also a valuable tool as an in vitro model to assess the intracellular mechanisms that drive DC activation by aggregated therapeutic proteins."

Soil microbial communities might be significantly affected by elevated temperatures, which influence the functioning of soils within high-alpine ecosystems. To evaluate the potential of the permafrost microbiome to adapt to short-term moderate and extreme warming, we set up an incubation experiment with permafrost and active soil layers from northern and southern slopes of a high-alpine mountain ridge on Muot da Barba Peider in the Swiss Alps. Soils were acclimated to increasing temperatures (4-40°C) for 26 days before being exposed to a heat shock treatment of 40°C for 4 days. Alpha-diversity in all soils increased slightly under gradual warming, from 4 to 25°C, but then dropped considerably at 40°C. Similarly, heat shock induced strong changes in microbial community structures and functioning in the active layer of soils from both northern and southern slope aspects. In contrast, permafrost soils showed only minor changes in their microbial community structures and no changes in their functioning, except regarding specific respiration activity. Shifts in microbial community structures with increasing temperature were significantly more pronounced for bacteria than for fungi, regardless of the soil origin, suggesting higher resistance of high-alpine fungi to short-term warming. Firmicutes, mainly represented by Tumebacillus and Alicyclobacillaceae OTUs, increased strongly at 40°C in active layer soils, reaching almost 50% of the total abundance. In contrast, Saccharibacteria decreased significantly with increasing temperature across all soil samples. Overall, our study highlights the divergent responses of fungal and bacterial communities to increased temperature. Fungi were highly resistant to increased temperatures compared to bacteria, and permafrost communities showed surprisingly low response to rising temperature. The unique responses were related to both site aspect and soil origin indicating that distinct differences within high-alpine soils may be driven by substrate limitation and legacy effects of soil temperatures at the field site.",Akt/AS160 Signaling Pathway Inhibition Impairs Infection by Decreasing Rab14-Controlled Sphingolipids Delivery to Chlamydial Inclusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001235,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, intercepts different trafficking pathways of the host cell to acquire essential lipids for its survival and replication, particularly from the Golgi apparatus via a Rab14-mediated transport. Molecular mechanisms underlying how these bacteria manipulate intracellular transport are a matter of intense study. Here, we show that C. trachomatis utilizes Akt/AS160 signaling pathway to promote sphingolipids delivery to the chlamydial inclusion through Rab14-controlled vesicular transport. C. trachomatis provokes Akt phosphorylation along its entire developmental life cycle and recruits phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) to the inclusion membrane. As a consequence, Akt Substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), also known as TBC1D4, a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) for Rab14, is phosphorylated and therefore inactivated. Phosphorylated AS160 (pAS160) loses its ability to promote GTP hydrolysis, favoring Rab14 binding to GTP. Akt inhibition by an allosteric isoform-specific Akt inhibitor (iAkt) prevents AS160 phosphorylation and reduces Rab14 recruitment to chlamydial inclusions. iAkt further impairs sphingolipids acquisition by C. trachomatis-inclusion and provokes lipid retention at the Golgi apparatus. Consequently, treatment with iAkt decreases chlamydial inclusion size, bacterial multiplication, and infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were found in AS160-depleted cells. By electron microscopy, we observed that iAkt generates abnormal bacterial forms as those reported after sphingolipids deprivation or Rab14 silencing. Taken together, our findings indicate that targeting the Akt/AS160/Rab14 axis could constitute a novel strategy to limit chlamydial infections, mainly for those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",Removal of a Subset of Non-essential Genes Fully Attenuates a Highly Virulent Mycoplasma Strain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001234,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms and cause a number of economically important diseases affecting humans, animals, insects, and plants. Here, we demonstrate that highly virulent Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies capri (Mmc) can be fully attenuated via targeted deletion of non-essential genes encoding, among others, potential virulence traits. Five genomic regions, representing approximately 10% of the original Mmc genome, were successively deleted using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an engineering platform. Specifically, a total of 68 genes out of the 432 genes verified to be individually non-essential in the JCVI-Syn3.0 minimal cell, were excised from the genome. In vitro characterization showed that this mutant was similar to its parental strain in terms of its doubling time, even though 10% of the genome content were removed. A novel in vivo challenge model in goats revealed that the wild-type parental strain caused marked necrotizing inflammation at the site of inoculation, septicemia and all animals reached endpoint criteria within 6 days after experimental infection. This is in contrast to the mutant strain, which caused no clinical signs nor pathomorphological lesions. These results highlight, for the first time, the rational design, construction and complete attenuation of a Mycoplasma strain via synthetic genomics tools. Trait addition using the yeast-based genome engineering platform and subsequent in vitro or in vivo trials employing the Mycoplasma chassis will allow us to dissect the role of individual candidate Mycoplasma virulence factors and lead the way for the development of an attenuated designer vaccine.",Beneficial Effects of Pomegranate Peel Extract and Probiotics on Pre-adipocyte Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001233,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"The beneficial effects of pomegranate are due to the ellagitannins and anthocyanins content, which are protective toward a wide variety of diseases including inflammatory diseases. Many investigators have reported that pomegranate waste (peel and seeds) extracts, made from waste product of industrial processing, show free radical scavenger and a potent antioxidant capacity. Pomegranate extracts (PEs) were also reported to possess noteworty antibacterial, antiviral, hypolipidemic, and anti-inflammatory bioactivities thanks to the polyphenolic compounds content, which includes punicalagins, gallic acid, and ellagic acid derivatives. The focus of the present manuscript was to study the prebiotic potentiality of a PE, soluble in water, and characterized through HPLC-PDA-ESI/MS 
n
 for its phenolic content. Moreover, since it has been reported that pomegranate extracts decreased the level of lipids in the blood and that a number of probiotic strains have been shown to affect adipogenesis in cell culture, this study was also performed to test the in vitro effects of PE and probiotic L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 strain (LGG) on 3T3-L1 cell line. PE and probiotics substantially reduced the triglyceride content and intracellular lipid increase, compared to the control group. However, the combination treatment of PE and LGG filtered spent broth (SB) was the most effective in reducing triglyceride content and intracellular lipid accumulation. The mRNA expression levels of the main transcriptional factors implicated in adipocyte differentiation were substantially lower in 3T3-L1 cells treated with PE and LGG filtered SB. These results evidenced that a synergistic effect of probiotics and polyphenols contained in PE may affect in vitro adipogenesis and may contribute in development of new nutraceutical/probiotic-based remedies to prevent and to treat obesity.",The Majority of Active Rhodobacteraceae in Marine Sediments Belong to Uncultured Genera: A Molecular Approach to Link Their Distribution to Environmental Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001232,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"General studies on benthic microbial communities focus on fundamental biogeochemical processes or the most abundant constituents. Thereby, minor fractions such as the Rhodobacteraceae are frequently neglected. Even though this family belongs to the most widely distributed bacteria in the marine environment, their proportion on benthic microbial communities is usually within or below the single digit range. Thus, knowledge on these community members is limited, even though their absolute numbers might exceed those from the pelagic zone by orders of magnitudes. To unravel the distribution and diversity of benthic, metabolically active Rhodobacteraceae, we have now analyzed an already existing library of bacterial 16S rRNA transcripts. The dataset originated from 154 individual sediment samples comprising seven oceanic regions and a broad variety of environmental conditions. Across all samples, a total of 0.7% of all 16S rRNA transcripts was annotated as Rhodobacteraceae. Among those, Sulfitobacter, Paracoccus, and Phaeomarinomonas were the most abundant cultured representatives, but the majority (78%) was affiliated to uncultured family members. To define them, the 45 most abundant Rhodobacteraceae-OTUs assigned as ""uncultured"" were phylogenetically assembled in new clusters. Their next relatives particularly belonged to different subgroups other than the Roseobacter group, reflecting a large part of the hidden diversity within the benthic Rhodobacteraceae with unknown functions. The general composition of active Rhodobacteraceae communities was found to be specific for the geographical location, exhibiting a decreasing richness with sediment depth. One-third of the Rhodobacteraceae-OTUs significantly responded to the prevailing redox regime, suggesting an adaption to anoxic conditions. A possible approach to predict their physiological properties is to identify the metabolic capabilities of their nearest relatives. Those need to be proven by physiological experiments, as soon an isolate is available. Because many uncultured members of these subgroups likely thrive under anoxic conditions, in future research, a molecular-guided cultivation strategy can be pursued to isolate novel Rhodobacteraceae from sediments.",Diverse Large HIV-1 Non-subtype B Clusters Are Spreading Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in Spain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001231,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"In Western Europe, the HIV-1 epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) is dominated by subtype B. However, recently, other genetic forms have been reported to circulate in this population, as evidenced by their grouping in clusters predominantly comprising European individuals. Here we describe four large HIV-1 non-subtype B clusters spreading among MSM in Spain. Samples were collected in 9 regions. A pol fragment was amplified from plasma RNA or blood-extracted DNA. Phylogenetic analyses were performed via maximum likelihood, including database sequences of the same genetic forms as the identified clusters. Times and locations of the most recent common ancestors (MRCA) of clusters were estimated with a Bayesian method. Five large non-subtype B clusters associated with MSM were identified. The largest one, of F1 subtype, was reported previously. The other four were of CRF02_AG (CRF02_1; n = 115) and subtypes A1 (A1_1; n = 66), F1 (F1_3; n = 36), and C (C_7; n = 17). Most individuals belonging to them had been diagnosed of HIV-1 infection in the last 10 years. Each cluster comprised viruses from 3 to 8 Spanish regions and also comprised or was related to viruses from other countries: CRF02_1 comprised a Japanese subcluster and viruses from 8 other countries from Western Europe, Asia, and South America; A1_1 comprised viruses from Portugal, United Kingom, and United States, and was related to the A1 strain circulating in Greece, Albania and Cyprus; F1_3 was related to viruses from Romania; and C_7 comprised viruses from Portugal and was related to a virus from Mozambique. A subcluster within CRF02_1 was associated with heterosexual transmission. Near full-length genomes of each cluster were of uniform genetic form. Times of MRCAs of CRF02_1, A1_1, F1_3, and C_7 were estimated around 1986, 1989, 2013, and 1983, respectively. MRCA locations for CRF02_1 and A1_1 were uncertain (however initial expansions in Spain in Madrid and Vigo, respectively, were estimated) and were most probable in Bilbao, Spain, for F1_3 and Portugal for C_7. These results show that the HIV-1 epidemic among MSM in Spain is becoming increasingly diverse through the expansion of diverse non-subtype B clusters, comprising or related to viruses circulating in other countries.",Resistance and Resilience of Sulfidogenic Communities in the Face of the Specific Inhibitor Perchlorate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001230,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas, produced by the activity of sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM). Owing to the environmental, economic and human-health consequences of sulfide, there is interest in developing specific inhibitors of SRM. Recent studies have identified perchlorate as a promising emerging inhibitor. The aim of this work is to quantitatively dissect the inhibitory dynamics of perchlorate. Sulfidogenic mixed continuous-flow systems were treated with perchlorate. SRM number, sulfide production and community structure were monitored pre-, during and post-treatment. The data generated was compared to a simple mathematical model, where SRM growth slows as a result of inhibition. The experimental data supports the interpretation that perchlorate largely acts to suppress SRM growth rates, rendering planktonic SRM increasingly susceptible to wash-out. Surface-attachment was identified as an important parameter preventing SRM wash-out and thus governing inhibitory dynamics. Our study confirmed the lesser depletion of surface-attached SRM as compared to planktonic SRM during perchlorate treatment. Indirect effects of perchlorate (bio-competitive exclusion of SRM by dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria, DPRB) were also assayed by amending reactors with DPRB. Indeed, low concentrations of perchlorate coupled with DRPB amendment can drive sulfide concentrations to zero. Further, inhibition in a complex community was compared to that in a pure culture, highlighting similarities and differences between the two scenarios. Finally, we quantified susceptibility to perchlorate across SRM in various culture conditions, showing that prediction of complex behavior in continuous systems from batch results is possible. This study thus provides an overview of the sensitivity of sulfidogenic communities to perchlorate, as well as mechanisms underlying these patterns.",Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Biocontrol Mechanism of Bacillus velezensis F21 Against Fusarium Wilt on Watermelon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001229,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"The watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is one of the most important horticultural crops for fruit production worldwide. However, the production of watermelon is seriously restricted by one kind of soilborne disease, Fusarium wilt, which is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon). In this study, we identified an efficient PGPR strain B. velezensis F21, which could be used in watermelon production for Fon control. The results of biocontrol mechanisms showed that B. velezensis F21 could suppress the growth and spore germination of Fon in vitro. Moreover, B. velezensis F21 could also enhance plant basal immunity to Fon by increasing the expression of plant defense related genes and activities of some defense enzymes, such as CAT, POD, and SOD. To elucidate the detailed mechanisms regulating B. velezensis F21 biocontrol of Fusarium wilt in watermelon, a comparative transcriptome analysis using watermelon plant roots treated with B. velezensis F21 or sterile water alone and in combination with Fon inoculation was conducted. The transcriptome sequencing results revealed almost one thousand ripening-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the process of B. velezensis F21 triggering ISR (induced systemic resistance) to Fon. In addition, the Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment indicated that numerous of transcription factors (TFs) and plant disease resistance genes were activated and validated by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which showed significant differences in expression levels in the roots of watermelon with different treatments. In addition, genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway and phytohormone signaling pathway were analyzed, and the results indicated that B. velezensis F21 could enhance plant disease resistance to Fon through the above related genes and phytohormone signal factors. Taken together, this study substantially expands transcriptome data resources and suggests a molecular framework for B. velezensis F21 inducing systemic resistance to Fon in watermelon. In addition, it also provides an effective strategy for the control of Fusarium wilt in watermelon.",Fungi Originating From Tree Leaves Contribute to Fungal Diversity of Litter in Streams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001228,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Biomass production and decomposition are key processes in ecology, where plants are primarily responsible for production and microbes act in decomposition. Trees harbor foliar microfungi living on and inside leaf tissues, epiphytes, and endophytes, respectively. Early researchers hypothesized that all fungal endophytes are parasites or latent saprophytes, which slowly colonize the leaf tissues for decomposition. While this has been proven for some strains in the terrestrial environment, it is not known whether foliar microfungi from terrestrial origin can survive or perform decomposition in the aquatic environment. On the other hand, aquatic hyphomycetes, fungi which decompose organic material in stream environments, have been suggested to have a plant-associated life phase. Our aim was to study how much the fungal communities of leaves and litter submerged in streams overlap. Ergosterol content on litter, which is an estimator of fungal biomass, was 5-14 times higher in submerged litter than in senescent leaves, indicating active fungal colonization. Leaves generally harbored a different microbiome prior to than after submergence in streams. The Chao1 richness was significantly higher (93.7 vs. 60.7, p = 0.004) and there were more observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (78.3 vs. 47.4, p = 0.004) in senescent leaves than in stream-immersed litter. There were more Leotiomycetes (9%, p = 0.014) in the litter. We identified a group of 35 fungi (65%) with both plant- and water-associated lifestyles. Of these, eight taxa had no previous references to water, such as lichenicolous fungi. Six OTUs were classified within Glomeromycota, known as obligate root symbionts with no previous records from leaves. Five members of Basidiomycota, which are rare in aquatic environments, were identified in the stream-immersed litter only. Overall, our study demonstrates that foliar microfungi contribute to fungal diversity in submerged litter.",Tools and Approaches for Dissecting Protein Bacteriocin Import in Gram-Negative Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001227,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 22,"Bacteriocins of Gram-negative bacteria are typically multi-domain proteins that target and kill bacteria of the same or closely related species. There is increasing interest in protein bacteriocin import; from a fundamental perspective to understand how folded proteins are imported into bacteria and from an applications perspective as species-specific antibiotics to combat multidrug resistant bacteria. In order to translocate across the cell envelope and cause cell death, protein bacteriocins hijack nutrient uptake pathways. Their import is energized by parasitizing intermembrane protein complexes coupled to the proton motive force, which delivers a toxic domain into the cell. A plethora of genetic, structural, biochemical, and biophysical methods have been applied to find cell envelope components involved in bacteriocin import since their discovery almost a century ago. Here, we review the various approaches that now exist for investigating how protein bacteriocins translocate into Gram-negative bacteria and highlight areas of research that will need methodological innovations to fully understand this process. We also highlight recent studies demonstrating how bacteriocins can be used to probe organization and architecture of the Gram-negative cell envelope itself."

These products are the main source of protein in the diet of the low-income population in the region. The fermented milk is prepared by spontaneous fermentation without back-slopping. Whereas, the leaf extract of Calotropis procera is used for curdling the milk to prepare the soft Wagashi cheese. The present study aims to provide in-depth analysis of yeast communities associated with these traditional milk products by high-throughput Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of fungal rRNA genes. A total of 60 samples, 20 samples of fermented milk each from Benin and Niger, and 20 samples of Wagashi cheese from Benin were used for analysis. The metagenomic investigation revealed that Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida parapsilosis, and Sagenomella keratitidis were the predominant yeast species present in the traditional milk products. Furthermore, we noticed a high presence of K. marxianus (61.1% relative abundance) in the Wagashi cheese and S. cerevisiae (28.4% relative abundance) in the fermented milk of Niger. The presence of potential pathogenic yeast C. parapsilosis and S. keratitidis in these African milk products calls for further investigation to assess their safety. The predominant yeast K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae, recognized with generally regarded as safe (GRAS) status, could be further selected as starter culture along with lactic acid bacteria for developing controlled fermentation processes with enhanced product quality and safety.",Structural and Functional Characterization of the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) Needle of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001211,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"The type three secretion system (T3SS) is a macromolecular protein nano-syringe used by different bacterial pathogens to inject effectors into host cells. The extracellular part of the syringe is a needle-like filament formed by the polymerization of a 9-kDa protein whose structure and proper localization on the bacterial surface are key determinants for efficient toxin injection. Here, we combined in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches to characterize the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T3SS needle and its major component PscF. Using a combination of mutagenesis, phenotypic analyses, immunofluorescence, proteolysis, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular modeling, we propose a model of the P. aeruginosa needle that exposes the N-terminal region of each PscF monomer toward the outside of the filament, while the core of the fiber is formed by the C-terminal helix. Among mutations introduced into the needle protein PscF, D76A, and P47A/Q54A caused a defect in the assembly of the needle on the bacterial surface, although the double mutant was still cytotoxic on macrophages in a T3SS-dependent manner and formed filamentous structures in vitro. These results suggest that the T3SS needle of P. aeruginosa displays an architecture that is similar to that of other bacterial needles studied to date and highlight the fact that small, targeted perturbations in needle assembly can inhibit T3SS function. Therefore, the T3SS needle represents an excellent drug target for small molecules acting as virulence blockers that could disrupt pathogenesis of a broad range of bacteria.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa Swarmer Cells Adaptation Toward UVc Radiations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001210,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Swarming is the most rapid surface motility allowing Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria to rapidly colonize new surfaces. However, swarming behavior is affected by environmental factors like ultraviolet irradiation (UVc). UVc radiation is the most disinfection technology usually applied for wastewater and proven to be effective to inactivate microorganisms. However, efficiency against motile bacteria is not yet studied. This study aims to explain the mechanisms of resistance of swarmer P. aeruginosa cells toward UVc exposure. P. aeruginosa liquid cultures were allowed to swarm across a semisolid surface for 18 h and directly exposed to UVc radiations. Emergent swarmer colonies, revealed after re-incubation, were selected to study biofilm formation, fatty acid (FA) composition, and ultrastructure. Our results showed that membrane adaptation to UVc radiations was seen in Pseudomonas cells by an increase of cyclic fatty acid (CFA) content, confirming the role of cyclopropane in radio-resistance of swarmer cells. Furthermore, electron microscopic study confirmed that over production of S-layer is believed to be a protective form adopted by P. aeruginosa swarmer cells to resist after 5 min of UVc exposure. Moreover, membrane disintegration is the lethal effect observed after 15 min of UVc exposure. In the other hand, study of biofilm production showed an enhancement of biofilm formation, of swarmer cells mainly after 15 min of UVc exposure. There results confirmed that swarming process is highly correlated with particular FA composition of P. aeruginosa membrane and that radio-resistance of swarmer cells is highly supported by CFA biosynthesis and S-layer overproduction.","Diversity, Virulence, and Antimicrobial Resistance in Isolates From the Newly Emerging Klebsiella pneumoniae ST101 Lineage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001209,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"The global dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has been largely attributed to a few high-risk sequence types (STs) (ST258, ST11, ST512) associated with human disease. ST101 is an emerging clone that has been identified in different parts of the world with the potential to become a global, persistent public health threat. Recent research suggests the ST101 lineage is associated with an 11% increase in mortality rate in comparison to non-ST101 infections. In this study, we generated a high-quality, near-finished genome assembly of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate from Italy (isolate 4743) that is a single locus variant of ST101 (ST1685). We demonstrate that the 4743 genome contains virulence features such as an integrative conjugative element carrying the yersiniabactin siderophore (ICEKp3), the mannose-resistant Klebsiella-like (type III) fimbriae cluster (mrkABCDFHIJ), the ferric uptake system (kfuABC), the yersiniabactin receptor gene fyuA, a capsular K type K17, and an O antigen type of O1. K. pneumoniae 4743 carries the blaKPC-2 carbapenemase gene along with genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin, macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B. A comparative genomics analysis of 44 ST101 genomes as well as newly sequenced isolate 4743 identified variable antimicrobial resistance (AMR) resistance profiles and incompatibility plasmid types, but similar virulence factor profiles. Using Bayesian methodologies, we estimate the common ancestor for the ST101 lineage emerged in 1990 (95% HPD: 1965 to 2007) and isolates within the lineage acquired blaKPC after the divergence from its parental clonal group and dissemination. The identification of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes acquired by this newly emerging clone provides insight into the reported increased mortality rates and highlights its potential success as a persistent nosocomial pathogen. With a combination of both colistin resistance, carbapenem resistance, and several known virulence factors, the ST101 genetic repertoire may be a ""perfect storm"" allowing for a newly emerging, high-risk, extensively antibiotic resistant clone. This high-risk clone appears adept at acquiring resistance and may perpetuate the dissemination of extensive antimicrobial resistance. Greater focus on the acquisition of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes is crucial for understanding the spread of antibiotic resistance.",A Novel Highly Efficient Device for Growing Micro-Aerophilic Microorganisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001208,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"This work describes a novel, simple and cost-effective culture system, named the Micro-Oxygenated Culture Device (MOCD), designed to grow microorganisms under particularly challenging oxygenation conditions. Two microaerophilic magnetotactic bacteria, a freshwater Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1 and a marine Magnetospira sp. strain QH-2, were used as biological models to prove the efficiency of the MOCD and to evaluate its specifications. Using the MOCD, growth rates of MSR-1 and QH-2 increased by four and twofold, respectively, when compared to traditional growing techniques using simple bottles. Oxystat-bioreactors have been typically used and specifically designed to control low dissolved oxygen concentrations, however, the MOCD, which is far less sophisticated was proven to be as efficient for both MSR-1 and QH-2 cultures with regard to growth rate, and even better for MSR-1 when looking at cell yield (70% increase). The MOCD enables a wide range of oxygenation conditions to be studied, including different O2-gradients. This makes it an innovative and ingenious culture device that opens up new parameters for growing microaerobic microorganisms.","Set3 Is Required for Asexual Development, Aflatoxin Biosynthesis, and Fungal Virulence in Aspergillus flavus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001207,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Aspergillus flavus is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus for both plant and animal that produces carcinogenic toxins termed aflatoxins (AFs). To identify possible genetic targets to reduce AF contamination, in this study, we have characterized a novel A. flavus Set3, and it shares sequence homology with the yeast protein Set3. The set3 deletion mutants present no difference in growth rate but alterations in asexual development and secondary metabolite production when compared to the A. flavus wild type. Specifically, deletion of set3 gene decreases conidiophore formation and conidial production through downregulating expression of brlA and abaA genes. In addition, normal levels of set3 are required for sclerotial development and expression of sclerotia-related genes nsdC and sclR. Further analyses demonstrated that Set3 negatively regulates AF production as well as the concomitant expression of genes in the AF gene cluster. Importantly, our results also display that A. flavus Set3 is involved in crop kernel colonization. Taking together, these results reveal that a novel Set3 plays crucial roles in morphological development, secondary metabolism, and fungal virulence in A. flavus.","Harmful Effect of Rheinheimera sp. EpRS3 (Gammaproteobacteria) Against the Protist Euplotes aediculatus (Ciliophora, Spirotrichea): Insights Into the Ecological Role of Antimicrobial Compounds From Environmental Bacterial Strains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001206,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 21,"Rheinheimera sp. strain EpRS3, isolated from the rhizosphere of Echinacea purpurea, is already known for its ability to produce antibacterial compounds. By use of culture experiments, we verified and demonstrated its harmful effect against the ciliated protist Euplotes aediculatus (strain EASCc1), which by FISH experiments resulted to harbor in its cytoplasm the obligate bacterial endosymbiont Polynucleobacter necessarius (Betaproteobacteria) and the secondary endosymbiont ""Candidatus Nebulobacter yamunensis"" (Gammaproteobacteria). In culture experiments, the number of ciliates treated both with liquid broth bacteria-free (Supernatant treatment) and bacteria plus medium (Tq treatment), decreases with respect to control cells, with complete disappearance of ciliates within 6 h after Tq treatment. Results suggest that Rheinheimera sp. EpRS3 produces and releases in liquid culture one or more bioactive molecules affecting E. aediculatus survival. TEM analysis of control (not treated) ciliates allowed to morphologically characterize both kind of E. aediculatus endosymbionts. In treated ciliates, collected soon after the arising of cell suffering leading to death, TEM observations revealed some ultrastructural damages, indicating that P. necessarius endosymbionts went into degradation and vacuolization after both Supernatant and Tq treatments. Additionally, TEM investigation showed that when the ciliate culture was inoculated with Tq treatment, both a notable decrease of P. necessarius number and an increase of damaged and degraded mitochondria occur. FISH experiments performed on treated ciliates confirmed TEM results and, by means of the specific probe herein designed, disclosed the presence of Rheinheimera sp. EpRS3 both inside phagosomes and free in cytoplasm in ciliates after Tq treatment. This finding suggests a putative ability of Rheinheimera sp. EpRS3 to reintroduce itself in the environment avoiding ciliate digestion.",The Roles of Cholesterol and Its Metabolites in Normal and Malignant Hematopoiesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001203,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 21,"Hematopoiesis is sustained throughout life by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). There is accumulating evidence that cholesterol homeostasis is an important factor in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Increased cholesterol levels are known to promote proliferation and mobilization of HSCs, while hypercholesterolemia is associated with expansion of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood and links hematopoiesis with cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol is a precursor to steroid hormones, oxysterols, and bile acids. Among steroid hormones, 17β-estradiol (E2) induces HSC division and E2-estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling causes sexual dimorphism of HSC division rate. Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol and key substrates for bile acid synthesis and are considered to be bioactive lipids, and recent studies have begun to reveal their important roles in the hematopoietic and immune systems. 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27HC) acts as an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator and induces ERα-dependent HSC mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis. 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25HC) acts as a ligand for Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) and directs migration of B cells in the spleen during the adaptive immune response. Bile acids serve as chemical chaperones and alleviate endoplasmic reticulum stress in HSCs. Cholesterol metabolism is dysregulated in hematologic malignancies, and statins, which inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis, have cytotoxic effects in malignant hematopoietic cells. In this review, recent advances in our understanding of the roles of cholesterol and its metabolites as signaling molecules in the regulation of hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies are summarized.",Effects of Vitamin E-Stabilized Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene on Oxidative Stress Response and Osteoimmunological Response in Human Osteoblast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001202,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 21,"High Crosslink process was introduced in the development of joint prosthetic devices, in order to decrease the wear rate of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), but it also triggers the formation of free radicals and oxidative stress, which affects the physiological bone remodeling, leading to osteolysis. Vitamin E stabilization of UHMWPE was proposed to provide oxidation resistance without affecting mechanical properties and fatigue strength. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antioxidant effect of vitamin E added to UHMWPE on oxidative stress induced osteolysis, focusing in particular on the oxidative stress response in correlation with the production of osteoimmunological markers, Sclerostin and DKK-1, and the RANKL/OPG ratio compared to conventional UHMWPE wear debris. Human osteoblastic cell line SaOS2 were incubated for 96 h with wear particles derived from crosslinked and not crosslinked Vitamin E-stabilized, UHMWPE without Vitamin E, and growth medium as control. Cellular response to oxidative stress, compared to not treat cells, was evaluated in terms of proteins O-GlcNAcylation, cellular levels of OGA, and OGT proteins by immunoblotting. O-GlcNAcylation and its positive regulator OGT levels are increased in the presence of Vitamin E blended UHMWPE, in particular with not crosslinked Vit E stabilized UHMWPE. Conversely, the negative regulator OGA increased in the presence of UHMWPE not blended with Vitamin E. Vitamin E-stabilized UHMWPE induced a decrease of RANKL/OPG ratio compared to UHMWPE without Vitamin E, and the same effect was observed for Sclerostin, while DKK-1 was not significantly affected. In conclusion, Vitamin E stabilization of UHMWPE increased osteoblast response to oxidative stress, inducing a cellular mechanism aimed at cell survival. Vitamin E antioxidant effect influences the secretion of osteoimmunological factors, shifting the bone turnover balance toward bone protection stimuli. This suggests that Vitamin E-Stabilization of UHMWPE could contribute to reduction of oxidation-induced osteolysis and the consequent loosening of the prosthetic devices, therefore improving the longevity of total joint replacements.",Long-Term Follow Up of the Erectile Function of Testicular Cancer Survivors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001201,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 21,"The diagnosis of testicular cancer (TC) can have a considerable and persistent impact on a patient's sexuality, especially given its location. The high prevalence of TC in young adults, and the good prognosis, explain the great interest in sexual dysfunction and its influence on post-treatment quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the diagnosis and treatments (inguinal orchiectomy and chemotherapy) on sex life. For this purpose, we recruited 241 TC patients attending the Laboratory of Seminology-Sperm Bank ""Loredana Gandini"" for sperm cryopreservation (mean age 31.3 ± 6.9 years) and 223 cancer-free healthy men who were undergoing andrological screening (mean age 32.0 ± 7.7 years). The IIEF-15 questionnaire was administered at the baseline (post-orchiectomy, pre-chemotherapy-T0) and at 6 (T1), 12 (T2), 18 (T3), 24 (T4), 48 months (T5) and >5 years (T6, median 96 months) after chemotherapy to all patients, to evaluate the following domains: erectile function (EF), orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), intercourse satisfaction (IS) and overall satisfaction (OS). A subgroup of patients also underwent blood sex hormone analysis for further correlations with IIEF scores. At the baseline, 37.7% of patients had erectile dysfunction (EF score <26) and all IIEF domains except OF showed significantly lower scores than in controls (p < 0.001). Long-term follow-up revealed persistently lower scores in TC survivors than in controls for EF, SD, IS, and OS. Furthermore, most IIEF domains did not improve significantly in TC patients during the duration of the follow-up, with the exception of EF, which showed a significant improvement from T2. Finally, no significant correlation was found between hormone levels (gonadotropin and testosterone) and IIEF-15 scores. In conclusion, TC and its treatment have a significant effect on sexuality. The absence of a clear correlation with biochemical hypogonadism suggests that this may to a large extent be due to the surgical procedure itself, or to the psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis."

Methods: We established a score classification workflow based on evidence of pathogenicity to adapt the classification of DS-related SCN1A missense variants. In addition, we compiled the variants reported in the literature and our cohort and assessed the proposed pathogenic classification criteria. We combined information regarding previously established pathogenic amino acid changes, mode of inheritance, population-specific allele frequencies, localization within protein domains, and deleterious effect prediction analysis. Results: Our meta-analysis showed that 46% (506/1,101) of DS-associated SCN1A variants are missense. We applied the score classification workflow and 56.5% (286/506) of the variants had their classification changed from VUS: 17.8% (90/506) into ""pathogenic"" and 38.7% (196/506) as ""likely pathogenic."" Conclusion: Our results indicate that using multimodal analysis seems to be the best approach to interpret the pathogenic impact of SCN1A missense changes for the molecular diagnosis of patients with DS.

This is based on an integrative graviceptive input from the vertical semicircular canals and the otolith organs. Methods: The special focus is on human psychophysics, neurophysiological and imaging data on the adjustments of subjective visual vertical (SVV) and the subjective postural vertical. Furthermore, examples of mathematical modeling of specific vestibular cell functions for orientation in space in rodents and in patients are briefly presented. Results: Pathological tilts of the SVV in the roll plane are most sensitive and frequent clinical vestibular signs of unilateral lesions extending from the labyrinths via the brainstem and thalamus to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex. Due to crossings of ascending graviceptive fibers, peripheral vestibular and pontomedullary lesions cause ipsilateral tilts of the SVV; ponto-mesencephalic lesions cause contralateral tilts. In contrast, SVV tilts, which are measured in unilateral vestibular lesions at thalamic and cortical levels, have two different characteristic features: (i) they may be ipsi- or contralateral, and (ii) they are smaller than those found in lower brainstem or peripheral lesions. Motor signs such as head tilt and body lateropulsion, components of ocular tilt reaction, are typical for vestibular lesions of the peripheral vestibular organ and the pontomedullary brainstem (vestibular nucleus). They are less frequent in midbrain lesions (interstitial nucleus of Cajal) and rare in cortical lesions. Isolated body lateropulsion is chiefly found in caudal lateral medullary brainstem lesions. Vestibular function in the roll plane and its disorders can be mathematically modeled by an attractor model of angular head velocity cell and head direction cell function. Disorders manifesting with misperception of the body vertical are the pusher syndrome, the progressive supranuclear palsy, or the normal pressure hydrocephalus; they may affect roll and/or pitch plane. Conclusion: Clinical determinations of the SVV are easy and reliable. They indicate acute unilateral vestibular dysfunctions, the causative lesion of which extends from labyrinth to cortex. They allow precise topographical diagnosis of side and level in unilateral brainstem or peripheral vestibular disorders. SVV tilts may coincide with or differ from the perception of body vertical, e.g., in isolated body lateropulsion.",Apologies Repair Trust via Perceived Trustworthiness and Negative Emotions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001183,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"The present study examined whether perceptions of a transgressor's trustworthiness mediates the relationship between apologies and repaired trust, and the moderating role of negative emotions within this process. Chinese undergraduate students (N = 221) completed a trust game where they invested tokens in their counterpart, and either experienced no trust violation (i.e., half of the tokens returned), a trust violation (i.e., no tokens returned), or a trust violation followed by an apology. Participant's trust behavior was measured by the number of tokens they re-invested in their counterpart in a second round of the game. Participants also completed measures to assess perceptions of the transgressor's trustworthiness and emotional state. Results revealed that participants who received an apology were more likely to trust in their counterpart, compared to those who did not receive an apology, and this relationship was mediated by perceptions of the transgressor's trustworthiness. Further, the relationship between apologies and perceptions of the transgressors trustworthiness was moderated by negative emotions; apologies only improved perceptions of trustworthiness for participants who experienced less negative emotions.",Diazepam Reduces Escape and Increases Closed-Arms Exploration in Gerbils After 5 min in the Elevated Plus-Maze.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001181,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"Despite the wide implementation of the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test to assess anxiety-related behaviors in rodents, the interpretation of these measures in gerbils has received limited attention. Here, male gerbils were treated with vehicle or diazepam, followed by a 20-min EPM session. EPM data were subjected to minute-by-minute, 5-min bins and factor analyses. During the first 5-min, gerbils avoided the closed arms in favor of the open arms and diazepam increased open-arms entries; furthermore, a single factor (escape behavior) explained all the analyzed measures. Only after 5-min, gerbils reduced open-arms exploration and three independent factors emerged for each subsequent 5-min bin. These findings suggest that EPM data from gerbils should be analyzed in at least two 5-min bins. Measures from the standard 5-min session seem to be related to an escape response from the EPM through the open arms. Once habituated, measures from the second 5-min bin seem to be related to a conflictive situation: keep trying to escape unsuccessfully (due to open-arms height) or seek protection in the closed arms (unsafe places). Diazepam seems to reduce this conflict by mitigating the escape response (Factor 1 - Anxiety) and increasing closed-arms approach (Factor 2) and risk assessment (Factor 3). Unlike mice and rats, a decrease in open-arms exploration and an increase in risk assessment could be interpreted as an anxiolytic-like effect in gerbils.","Instrumental Technique, Expressivity, and Communication. A Qualitative Study on Learning Music in Individual and Collective Settings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001179,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"In this paper, we present a qualitative study comparing individual and collective music pedagogies from the point of view of the learner. In doing so, we discuss how the theoretical tools of embodied cognitive science (ECS) can provide adequate resources to capture the main properties of both contexts. We begin by outlining the core principles of ECS, describing how it emerged in response to the information-processing approach to mind, which dominated the cognitive sciences for the latter half of the 20th century. We then consider the orientation offered by ECS and its relevance for music education. We do this by identifying overlapping principles between three tenets of ECS, and three aspects of pedagogical practice. This results in the categories of ""instrumental technique,"" ""expressivity,"" and ""communication,"" which we adopted to examine and categorize the data emerging from our study. In conclusion, we consider the results of our study in light of ECS, discussing what implications can emerge for concrete pedagogical practices in both individual and collective settings.",Earthquake Exposure and Post-traumatic Stress Among Nepalese Mothers After the 2015 Earthquakes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001178,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"Introduction: Nepal suffered from major earthquakes in April 2015 resulting in great damage to the society. The objective of the current study is to describe the earthquake exposure, the impact on family's daily life and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their association in Nepalese mothers 20 months following the earthquakes. Methods: In a clinical trial in Bhaktapur, Nepal, 558 mothers responded to an inventory on earthquake exposure and the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) 20 months after the earthquakes. In multiple linear regression models, we estimated the associations between the earthquake exposure and the impact on the families' life and the IES-R score. Results: Over 60% reported that the earthquakes had a great deal of negative impact on their family's life. In 4.7%, close family members died, and in 10.5%, family members were injured. 24% had IES-R scores indicating PTSD symptoms within clinical concern or a possible diagnosis. Lower levels of education were associated with higher scores on the total IES-R. Mothers who report that the earthquakes had a great deal of negative impact had higher total IES-R scores [9.8, 95% CI (5.9, 13.6)] compared to mothers that reported no such negative impact. Mothers with family members who were killed had higher IES-R scores [3.6, 95% CI (1.6, 5.5)] than those with no family members who died. Mothers assisting in rescue efforts had lower IES-R scores [2.8, 95% CI (0.8, 4.8)] than those not assisting. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates high levels of exposure to traumatic events, large negative impact on the everyday life of the families, and a high level of PTSD symptoms. There was a consistent and graded association between the exposure variables and PTSD symptoms. The large impact of the earthquakes on these Nepalese mothers underscore the importance of awareness of mental disorders following major natural catastrophes for marginalized families.",Statistical Differences in Set Analysis in Badminton at the RIO 2016 Olympic Games.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001177,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"The aim of the present study was to determine statistical differences in a set of badminton competition matches in five different modalities with regard to competition level (Group Phase vs. Eliminatory Phase). Data from 453 sets (125 in men's singles; 108 sets in women's singles; 77 sets in men's doubles; 73 in women's doubles and 70 in mixed doubles) from the RIO 2016 Olympics Games were recorded and classified in two groups of variables to analyze variables related to match (5) and set (15). A descriptive analysis and univariate test (Mann-Whitney U) for non-parametric data were conducted. The results show in men's and women's singles all the variables related to match were higher in the Elimination Phase than in the Group Phase (p < 0.01). In Sets 1 and 3, the longest set duration, rally and average rally were found in the Elimination Phase than Group Stage (p < 0.05). In women's singles, these differences were also recorded in Set 2. For doubles, the results are more stable among groups. Men's doubles had a longer duration of the match and set (sets 1 and set 2) (p < 0.01), and also scored highest for average rally strokes (sets 1 3) (p < 0.05) and shuttles used in the Elimination Phase vs. the Group Phase along the match (p < 0.01). In women's doubles, more shuttles were used in a match in the Elimination than in the Group Phase. Moreover, the same results are established for Set 2, including for average rally. Mixed doubles saw no match going to three sets. However, the greatest differences showed a longer rally and average rally being registered in the Elimination than in the Group Phase. In conclusion, the timing factors of the badminton singles and doubles games were different in the Elimination and Group Phases. This information may help players and coaches prepare and administer different types of workouts or, more specifically, competition schedules adapted to the characteristics of modern badminton.",Language Origins Viewed in Spontaneous and Interactive Vocal Rates of Human and Bonobo Infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001176,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 22,"From the first months of life, human infants produce ""protophones,"" speech-like, non-cry sounds, presumed absent, or only minimally present in other apes. But there have been no direct quantitative comparisons to support this presumption. In addition, by 2 months, human infants show sustained face-to-face interaction using protophones, a pattern thought also absent or very limited in other apes, but again, without quantitative comparison. Such comparison should provide evidence relevant to determining foundations of language, since substantially flexible vocalization, the inclination to explore vocalization, and the ability to interact socially by means of vocalization are foundations for language. Here we quantitatively compare data on vocalization rates in three captive bonobo (Pan paniscus) mother-infant pairs with various sources of data from our laboratories on human infant vocalization. Both humans and bonobos produced distress sounds (cries/screams) and laughter. The bonobo infants also produced sounds that were neither screams nor laughs and that showed acoustic similarities to the human protophones. These protophone-like sounds confirm that bonobo infants share with humans the capacity to produce vocalizations that appear foundational for language. Still, there were dramatic differences between the species in both quantity and function of the protophone and protophone-like sounds. The bonobo protophone-like sounds were far less frequent than the human protophones, and the human protophones were far less likely to be interpreted as complaints and more likely as vocal play. Moreover, we found extensive vocal interaction between human infants and mothers, but no vocal interaction in the bonobo mother-infant pairs-while bonobo mothers were physically responsive to their infants, we observed no case of a bonobo mother vocalization directed to her infant. Our cross-species comparison focuses on low- and moderate-arousal circumstances because we reason the roots of language entail vocalization not triggered by excitement, for example, during fighting or intense play. Language appears to be founded in flexible vocalization, used to regulate comfortable social interaction, to share variable affective states at various levels of arousal, and to explore vocalization itself.",Do Emotional Faces Affect Inhibition of Return? An ERP Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001175,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"Inhibition of Return (IOR) refers to an individual's slowed localization or discrimination performance for targets that appear in previously cued versus uncued location after a relatively long delay after cue (∼300-500 ms). The current study adopted a cue-target paradigm and used behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures to investigate whether IOR would be modulated by emotional faces during an emotion recognition task. For reaction time measure, we found IOR effect and the magnitude of IOR effect were comparable for fearful face target and neutral face target. For ERP measures, valid cues were associated with smaller P1 and larger N1 waveform than that for invalid cues. Fearful faces were associated with a larger N170 than neutral faces. The onset latency of the stimulus-locked lateralised readiness potential (LRP) in the valid cue condition was longer than that in the invalid cue condition, while there was no significant difference on the onset latency of the response-locked LRP between the valid cue and invalid cue condition. These results support the notion that, regardless the emotion component of the stimulus, the inhibitory bias of attention to previous visited location before response contributes to the IOR.",Environment-Specific vs. General Knowledge and Their Role in Pro-environmental Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001174,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 21,"Environmental knowledge has been established as a behavior-distal, but necessary antecedent of pro-environmental behavior. The magnitude of its effect is difficult to estimate due to methodological deficits and variability of measures proposed in the literature. This paper addresses these methodological issues with an updated, comprehensive and objective test of environmental knowledge spanning a broad variety of current environment related topics. In a multivariate study (n = 214), latent data modeling was employed to explore the internal factor structure of environmental knowledge, its relationship with general knowledge and explanatory power on pro-environmental behavior. We tested competing factor models and uncovered a general factor of environmental knowledge. The main novel finding of the study concerns its relationship with general knowledge. Employing an established test of general knowledge to measure crystallized intelligence revealed a near perfect relationship between environmental and general knowledge. This general knowledge (including the environmental domain) accounted for 7% of the variance in environmentally significant behavior. Age, additionally to acquired education, emerged as a common predictor for both general knowledge and environmentally significant behavior. We discuss the consequences of the strong relation between general and environmental knowledge and provide a possible explanation for the positive age-environmental conservation relationship reported in the literature."
