Despite seemingly diverse charge transport mechanisms and device set-ups, various molecular electronics systems can benefit from the same fundamental principles of physical organic chemistry, based upon the electronic structure and geometry of their molecular building blocks and the intermolecular interactions between them. This is not an exhaustive review of organic electronics, but rather a focused account of primarily our own recent efforts aimed at developing a unified approach to understanding and designing conductive molecular species for diverse electronic applications.",What Can We Learn from First Principles Multi-Scale Models in Catalysis? The Role of the Ni/Al₂O₃ Interface in Water-Gas Shift and Dry Reforming as a Case Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975250,Chimia,2019 05 01,"Computational first principles models based on density functional theory (DFT) have emerged as an important tool to address reaction mechanisms and active sites in metal nanoparticle catalysis. However, the common evaluation of potential energy surfaces for selected reaction steps contrasts with the complexity of reaction networks under operating conditions, where the interplay of adsorbate populations and competing routes at reaction conditions determine the most relevant states for catalyst activity and selectivity. Here, we discuss how the use of a multi-scale first principles approach combining DFT calculations at the atomistic level with kinetic models may be used to understand reactions catalyzed by metal nanoparticles. The potential of such an approach is illustrated for the case of Al₂O₃-supported Ni nanoparticle catalysts in the water-gas shift and dry reforming reactions. In these systems, both Ni nanoparticle (metal) as well as metal/oxide interface sites are available and may play a role in catalysis, which depends not only on the energy for critical reaction steps, as captured by DFT, but also on the reaction temperature and adsorbate populations, as shown by microkinetic modelling and experiments.",Quantifying Isotopic Signatures of N₂O Using Quantum Cascade Laser Absorption Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975249,Chimia,2019 05 08,"Nitrous oxide, N₂O, is the environmentally most relevant constituent of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Human activities, e.g. the agricultural use of mineral fertilizers, accelerate nitrogen transformations, leading to higher emissions of this strong greenhouse gas. Investigating the stable isotopic composition of N₂O provides a better understanding of formation mechanisms to disentangle its variable source and sink processes. Mid-infrared (mid-IR) laser spectroscopy is a highly attractive technique to analyze N₂O isotopocules based on their specific ro-vibrational absorption characteristics. Specifically, quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) in combination with preconcentration has shown to be powerful for simultaneous and high-precision analysis of the main N₂O isotopocules. Recently, in the scope of my PhD project, we have been advancing this analytical technique for the analysis of the very rare doubly substituted N₂O isotopic species 15N14N18O, 14N15N18O, and 15N15N16O, also known as clumped isotopes. Currently, we are investigating the potential of these novel isotopic tracers to track the complex N₂O production and consumption pathways. Improved understanding of the nitrogen cycle will be a major step towards N₂O emission reduction.",Dirac States of 2D Topological Insulators: Effect of Heterovalent Dopant-Content.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975247,"Microscopy and microanalysis : the official journal of Microscopy Society of America, Microbeam Analysis Society, Microscopical Society of Canada",2019 04 12,"We have studied Bi2Se3 at its 2D-limit using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Bulk Bi2Se3 is a well-known topological insulator having gapless surface states. In the 2D limit, the interior of the material exhibits a band gap, whereas the periphery shows a gapless metallic state having a Dirac point. We demonstrate a method to tune the Fermi energy and hence the Dirac point of Bi2Se3 nanoplates through doping at the anionic site. For this purpose, STS measurements were carried out on the Bi2Se3 system. We have used bromide as a dopant, which turns the material to n-type in nature. As a result, STS studies infer that the Fermi energy (EF) shifted toward the conduction band and consequently the Dirac point could be found to move away from Fermi energy. Through STS measurements, we have demonstrated a correlation between the shift of Dirac point position and the dopant content. The size, shape, and compositions of Bi2Se3 nanoflakes and concentration of bromine in the doped nanostructures were determined using transmission electron microscopy, associated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, and X-ray diffraction.",Meta-analytic comparison of robotic and transoral laser surgical procedures in supraglottic carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975246,The Journal of laryngology and otology,2019 06 11,To assess published reports of oncological surgical success rates in patients who underwent transoral laser supraglottic surgery and robotic surgery for supraglottic cancer.,Beliefs about safety behaviours in the prediction of safety behaviour use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975244,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,2019 04 12,"Safety behaviours are ubiquitous across anxiety disorders and are associated with the aetiology, maintenance and exacerbation of anxiety.

This qualitative study compares policy and practice for involving the public in major service changes across the UK's four health systems (England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland). We analysed policy documents, and conducted interviews with officials, stakeholders, NHS staff and public campaigners (total number of interviewees = 47). Involving the public in major service change was acknowledged as a policy challenge in all four systems. Despite ostensible similarities, there were some clear differences between the four health systems' processes for involving patients and the public in major changes to health services. The extent of central Government oversight, the prescriptiveness of Government guidance, the role for intermediary bodies and arrangements for independent scrutiny of contentious decisions all vary. We analyse how health policy in the four systems has used 'sticks' and 'sermons' to promote particular approaches, and conclude that both policy and the wider system context within which health care organisations try to effect change are significant, and understudied aspect of contemporary practice.",Estimating the Attributable Disease Burden and Effects of Interhospital Patient Sharing on Clostridium difficile Infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975242,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,2019 05 20,To estimate the burden of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) due to interfacility patient sharing at regional and hospital levels.,Questionnaire survey on helminth control practices in horse farms in Ireland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975241,Parasitology,2019 06 14,"Knowledge regarding helminth control strategies and nematode infection of horses in Ireland is limited and only one study has been published recently. This present study was designed to investigate the current helminth control strategies followed by horse owners in Ireland. A questionnaire was formulated to collect data on general grazing, pasture management and deworming strategies including the use of fecal egg counts. Questionnaires were emailed to 700 members of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Horse Sport Ireland. Only 78 questionnaires were returned. Respondents indicated that horses are grazed for 16-24 h day-1 during the summer and autumn (89% and 65%, respectively). Removing feces from the pasture was implemented by 37.6% of respondents. Few (22.2%) owners kept horses off pasture after worming. Overall, ivermectin and moxidectin were the most commonly administered anthelmintics in 2014 by 75% and 62% of respondents, respectively. Benzimidazole and pyrantel drugs were used by 53% and 35% of respondents, respectively. The majority of farms (81.4%) treated horses 4-5 times per year and 74.2% only estimated the weight of the horses visually. The findings of this study illustrates that many stud managers/owners do not follow best practice with regard to helminth control and more education is needed."

Since humans have limited ability for EPA and DHA synthesis, these must be obtained from the diet, primarily from oily fish. Dietary EPA and DHA intakes are constrained by the size of fish stocks and by food choice. Seed oil from transgenic plants that synthesise EPA and DHA represents a potential alternative source of these fatty acids, but this has not been tested in humans. We hypothesised that incorporation of EPA and DHA into blood lipids from transgenic Camelina sativa seed oil (CSO) is equivalent to that from fish oil. Healthy men and women (18 to 30 years or 50 to 65 years) consumed 450 mg EPA plus DHA from either CSO or commercial blended fish oil (BFO) in test meals in a double blind, postprandial cross-over trial. There were no significant differences between test oils or sexes in EPA and DHA incorporation into plasma triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine or non-esterified fatty acids over 8 hours. There were no significant differences between test oils, age groups or sexes in postprandial VLDL, LDL or HDL sizes or concentrations. There were no significant differences between test oils in postprandial plasma TNFα, interleukin 6 or 10, or soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 concentrations in younger participants. These findings show that incorporation into blood lipids of EPA and DHA consumed as CSO was equivalent to BFO and that such transgenic plant oils are a suitable dietary source of EPA and DHA in humans.",Positive relationship between consumption of specific fish type and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk of Hong Kong lactating mothers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975227,The British journal of nutrition,2019 04 12,"Residents of Hong Kong have undergone a dietary transition from a traditional Chinese diet that is high in seafood to a more western diet. This may have affected the nutritional composition of breast milk of Hong Kong mothers. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between the dietary pattern and the fatty acid profile of the breast milk of lactating women in Hong Kong. Seventy-three volunteering healthy Hong Kong lactating mothers participated in the study. Their dietary intakes were assessed by using a 3-day dietary record and food frequency questionnaire. The mean ω-3 fatty acid levels were approximately 0.4% (EPA) and 0.9% (DHA) of total fatty acids in the breast milk of lactating mothers who had exclusively breastfed their infants aged 2 - 6 months. Maternal dietary intakes of omega-3 fatty acids were positively associated with their levels in the breast milk. The levels of maternal intakes of freshwater and saltwater fish, especially the consumption of salmon, croaker and mandarin fish, were significantly correlated with the content of DHA in breast milk. This study is among the very few in literature to determine the fatty acid profile of breast milk in Hong Kong populations and verify certain dietary factors that influence this profile. High levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA, were observed in the breast milk of Hong Kong lactating women. The findings may serve as a dietary reference for lactating mothers to optimize the fatty acid profile of their breast milk.",Development of a nutrient quality score for the complementary diets of Indonesian infants and relationships with linear growth and stunting: a longitudinal analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975226,The British journal of nutrition,2019 04 12,"Reducing multifactorial stunting is a priority for the 2025 World Health Organization Global Nutrition Target. In the plant-based complementary diets of low income countries, deficits in several growth-limiting micronutrients may contribute to stunting. Hence the intercorrelation between multiple micronutrients in terms of their intake and impact is important. Therefore, our aim was to develop a nutrient quality score using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a sample of Indonesian infants at 6, 9, and 12 months of age and to evaluate the association of the scores with linear growth and stunting. At 6 months, 217 mothers and infants were recruited from Sumedang District, West Java, with 195 and 189 followed at aged 9 and 12 months, respectively. Complementary food intakes were assessed using 2-day weighed food records. Eight correlated nutrients (vitamin A, ascorbic acid, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, and zinc) were summarized using PCA into a single nutrient pattern that explained 56% - 65% of the total variability. Nutrient quality scores were related to demographic, inflammation, and complementary food indicator variables in hypothesised directions. While no significant relationships were apparent with linear growth, the odds of being stunted at aged 9 and 12 months was lower for infants with a higher nutrient quality score at 9 months (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.95 and OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.88), respectively for the fully adjusted models.

However, in the Electronic Health Record, data related to many social risk factors are primarily recorded in free-text clinical notes, rather than as more readily computable structured data, and hence cannot currently be easily incorporated into automated assessments of health. In this paper, we present Moonstone, a new, highly configurable rule-based clinical natural language processing system designed to automatically extract information that requires inferencing from clinical notes. Our initial use case for the tool is focused on the automatic extraction of social risk factor information - in this case, housing situation, living alone, and social support - from clinical notes. Nursing notes, social work notes, emergency room physician notes, primary care notes, hospital admission notes, and discharge summaries, all derived from the Veterans Health Administration, were used for algorithm development and evaluation.",Recent advances of therapeutic targets based on the molecular signature in breast cancer: genetic mutations and implications for current treatment paradigms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975222,Journal of hematology & oncology,2019 04 23,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women all over the world.

When used to estimate the effects of treatments and interventions, an important limitation of these databases is the lack of information on important confounding variables. The high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) is an algorithm that generates a large number of empirically-derived covariates using administrative healthcare databases. The hdPS has been described as enabling adjustment by proxy, in which a large number of empirically-derived covariates may serve as proxies for unmeasured confounding variables. We examined the validity of this assumption using samples of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), for whom both administrative data and detailed clinical data were available. We considered three treatments in AMI patients: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins, while the first two treatments were also considered in CHF patients. We considered three propensity scores: (a) one derived using detailed clinical data; (b) the hdPS derived from administrative data; and (c) one derived from administrative data using expert opinion. Using each propensity score, we estimated inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weights. For each sample and treatment combination, and for each of the two propensity scores derived using administrative data, there were clinical variables not measured in administrative data that remained imbalanced after incorporating the IPT weights. However, the propensity score derived using clinical data always resulted in all clinical variables being balanced. When estimating hazard ratios, for some samples and treatment combinations, the hazard ratios estimated using the hdPS were more similar to those obtained using the clinical propensity score than were those obtained using the expert-derived propensity score. However, for other combinations, the effects estimated using the expert-derived propensity score were more similar to those obtained using the clinical propensity score than were those derived using the hdPS.",Cross-Cultural Comparison of Firefighters' Perception of Mobility and Occupational Injury Risks Associated with Personal Protective Equipment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975043,International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,2019 04 15,The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of personal protective equipment (PPE) on firefighters' perception of mobility and their experienced occupational injury risks between China and the United States.,Improving life after stroke needs global efforts to implement evidence-based physical activity pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975042,International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2019 04 12,"There is an urgent need to improve life after stroke across the world-especially in low-income countries-through methods that are effective, equitable and sustainable.

Participants performed a delayed free recall task and following each list reported which strategies they may have used on the prior list. Individual differences in effective encoding strategy use were positively correlated with overall recall performance. Examining recall dynamics suggested that variation in effective encoding strategy use was associated with greater recall, particularly on non-primacy items and slightly more organised recall in terms of recall transitions. However, no differences were found for recall of items at the first serial position, in recall initiation, or in how quickly participants recalled items. Collectively, the results are consistent with the notion that effective encoding strategies increase the strength of items, resulting in a higher likelihood of recovering the items during recall. Individual differences in control processes in the form of effective encoding strategies are critically important for understanding normal variation in memory abilities.",Divided attention and the encoding effects of retrieval.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975038,Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006),2019 05 13,"Retrieving from memory both reveals as well as modifies memory. It is important to understand how these encoding effects of retrieval differ from other forms of encoding. One possible difference relates to attention: divided attention is well known to disrupt memory encoding but typically has much less impact on memory retrieval. However, less is known about the relative attentional demands of the encoding consequences of retrieval. The current experiments examined retrieval-based encoding using free recall, a retrieval task purported to require substantial attentional resources. In three experiments, participants studied common category exemplars (Phase 1), restudied or freely recalled the exemplars (Phase 2), and then took a final free-recall test (Phase 3). Phase 2 occurred under full attention (FA) or divided attention (DA). In all three experiments, the negative effect of DA on final recall was significant in the restudy but not retrieval condition. The pattern persisted with short (Experiment 1) or long study lists (Experiment 2), requiring lesser or greater retrieval effort, and with multiple Phase 2 tests, permitting the development of more elaborate retrieval strategies (Experiment 3). The encoding effects of retrieval appear resilient to distraction, even using a memory task that is more effortful and easily disrupted by DA (i.e., free recall). In addition, these results are inconsistent with elaboration and effort accounts of retrieval-based learning.",Challenges to Traditional Narratives of Intractable Conflict Decrease Ingroup Glorification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975037,Personality & social psychology bulletin,2019 04 12,"Conflict narratives are cornerstones of group identity, but often facilitate violence by framing the group's actions in ways that foster defensive forms of group identification (i.e., glorification). Three experiments tested whether alternative narratives inclusive of the ingroup's and the adversarial group's suffering can reduce glorification. Israeli Jews (Study 1) and Americans (Study 2) reported less glorification after reading inclusive narratives rather than narratives that dismiss the outgroup's suffering. Study 3 found that through reducing glorification, inclusive narratives indirectly weakened support for retributive justice and militaristic policies and strengthened support for reconciliation. These effects were specific to people high in both (preexisting) glorification and attachment-people identified by prior research as the strongest supporters of violent approaches to conflict. These findings suggest that alternative narratives can reduce glorification by challenging the myopic focus of traditional conflict narratives on ingroup victimization, helping societies move beyond intractable conflict toward lasting peace.","Clinics as spaces of costly disclosure: HIV/STI testing and anticipated stigma among gay, bisexual and queer men.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975036,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 04 12,"Gay, bisexual and queer men in Singapore are disproportionately represented in prevalent HIV infections, relative to the general population. While anticipated stigma has been found to be a barrier to HIV/STI testing among gay, bisexual and queer men, little effort has been made to contextualise such stigma within the broader sociocultural milieu. We conducted 35 in-depth interviews with a purposively recruited sample of men in Singapore with a focus on topics such as sexual identity development, formative sexual experiences and HIV/STI testing experience. Interviews were analysed through thematic analysis using techniques borrowed from a grounded theory approach. Participants drew on their past interactions with family, friends, religion, the gay, bisexual and queer men's community and the wider society to construct meanings of deviance in the context of their sexuality. Participants articulated how anticipated stigma was rooted in such deviance, and how clinics or other HIV/STI-related health services served as physical spaces of costly disclosure by exposing or imposing 'deviant' identities on individuals who access these physical spaces, which were otherwise concealed. Findings from the study provide a framework for actions and interventions to address the roots of anticipated stigma in the context of HIV/STI testing among gay, bisexual and queer men.",Normative nursing ethics: A literature review and tentative recommendations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975035,Nursing ethics,2019 04 12,"We describe the results and implications of a literature review that identifies the number of normative and empirical articles, respectively, that have appeared in Nursing Ethics in each year from 1994 to 2017. The results of our analysis suggest a powerful trend away from normative scholarship and toward empirical investigation within the field of nursing ethics, both overall and comparatively. We argue that there are several important negative consequences of this trend, and we propose some potential solutions to address them."

We tested this claim across four studies (total N = 541) by examining associations between social dominance orientation (SDO)-a measure of preference for social hierarchy-and support for intergroup apologies. We found that higher SDO scores, and specifically the antiegalitarianism subdimension (social dominance orientation-egalitarianism [SDO-E]), predicted less apology support among U.S. residents in both domestic (Study 1) and international (Study 2) contexts. In Study 3, we found that the effect generalizes to an Australian cultural context. In Study 4, we demonstrated that the negative effect of SDO-E can extend to third-party contexts and is only observed when apologizing would be hierarchy attenuating. These studies show that the desire to maintain social hierarchies is an important driver of opposition to hierarchy-attenuating intergroup apologies.",Parental Warmth and Interpersonal Empathy as Predictors of Sexual Assault Bystander Intervention Efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975022,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 04 12,"Sexual victimization rates of women in the United States remain worryingly high. Much research has focused on the reduction of sexual violence with varying levels of success. One promising avenue of sexual violence reduction research provides evidence that bystanders who intervene appropriately can effectively contribute to a reduction in sexual assault. The Ecological Model for Bystander Intervention provides a conceptual framework for investigating what motivates and what inhibits bystanders. Empirical evidence on various levels of the model has been garnered; however, little is known about the association between particular developmental variables and bystander intervention efficacy situated in the microsystem. The goal of this study was to explore developmental predictors of bystander intervention efficacy. We predicted perceived parental warmth would be related to bystander intervention efficacy and that the relation would be mediated by empathy. University students (mean age = 19.2 years) completed anonymous online self-report measures of perceived maternal and paternal warmth, empathy, and bystander efficacy. The mediation model was supported by the data. As predicted, the path from parental warmth to empathy was significant ( p < .001) and the path from empathy to bystander intervention efficacy was significant ( p < .001). The indirect effect of parental warmth on bystander efficacy through empathy was significant ( p = .001). One implication of these findings is that characteristics that are related to bystander tendencies may develop early in the family environment. Efforts to increase bystander intervention may benefit from the recognition that empathy may be founded in earlier life experiences. Limitations and future directions are discussed.","The Overall Awareness and Impact of the WIXX Multimedia Communication Campaign, 2012-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975021,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 04 29,"Background: Evidence regarding the impact of physical activity (PA) communication campaigns among children is scarce. This study was aimed at examining the reach of the WIXX campaign and its impact on children's PA beliefs and behaviors. Methods: This study adopted a pre-posttest design. Children (9-13 y old) were recruited using a random digit dialing procedure. Self-reported outcomes included PA beliefs, trying new PAs, and meeting PA guidelines. WIXX awareness and survey periods were the treatment variables. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the main effect of treatment variables and the time-specific impact of WIXX. Results: The campaign reached 80.3% of the children. Fully adjusted results showed that girls with high (odd ratio = 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.0) and moderate (odd ratio = 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.8) awareness were more likely to have tried new PAs. Results from the sensitivity analyses suggested that this positive result was due to strategies implemented during the second year of the campaign. No other significant association between exposure and outcomes was observed. Conclusions: The WIXX campaign was successful in reaching a significant proportion of children. Although some encouraging results were observed among girls, WIXX awareness was not associated with changes on the examined outcomes among boys.",What Psychosocial Factors Determine the Physical Activity Patterns of University Students?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975020,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 04 29,"Background: Although levels of physical activity (PA) have been researched, no information on how university students organize their PA across different life domains is available. The purpose of this study is to explore if and how students organize their PA across transport and recreational domains, and to identify the psychosocial factors related to these patterns. Methods: Students from 31 Irish universities completed a supervised online survey measuring participant characteristics, psychosocial factors, and PA. Two-step cluster analysis was used to identify specific PA patterns in students. Binary logistic regressions identified factors associated with cluster membership while controlling for age, sex, household income, and perceived travel time to a university. Results: Analysis was performed on 6951 students (50.7% male; 21.51 [5.55] y). One Low Active cluster emerged. Four clusters containing a form of PA emerged including Active Commuters, Active in University, Active Outside University, and High Active. Increases in motivation and planning improved the likelihood of students being categorized in a cluster containing PA. Conclusion: One size does not fit all when it comes to students PA engagement, with 5 patterns identified. Health professionals are advised to incorporate strategies for increasing students' motivation, action planning, and coping planning into future PA promotion efforts.",Why Residuals Are Important in the Self-Efficacy-Performance Relationship Analysis: A Study Across 12 Cycling Sessions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975018,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 05,"Background: The positive role of self-efficacy in directing a wide range of health-related interventions has been well documented, including those targeting an increase in physical activity. However, rarely do researchers control the influence of past performance and past self-efficacy perception ratings when exploring the interaction of self-efficacy and performance, allowing for a refined understanding of this relationship and the unique contribution of each factor. Methods: A residualized past performance, residualized self-efficacy hierarchical regression model was used to examine the effect of prior past performance and pre-exercise self-efficacy on performance with a health-related task (12 aerobic exercise cycling sessions). Results: The previous day's residualized performance was a significant predictor of performance, as was same-day residualized self-efficacy (P < .001). However, residualized self-efficacy became a stronger predictor over time. Conclusions: While maintaining a consistent level of moderate-vigorous physical activity over 12 exercise sessions, participants increased their ratings of task self-efficacy, explaining an increasing portion of the variance in the self-efficacy-performance relationship days 9 to 12.",In Vitro Evaluation of the Gore Viabahn Balloon-Expandable Stent-Graft for Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975017,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,2019 05 20,To evaluate the safety and integrity of a new stent-graft as a potential bridging device in fenestrated stent-grafts using an in vitro fenestrated model.,Visfatin is involved in the cisplatin resistance of osteosarcoma cells via upregulation of Snail and Zeb1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975015,Cancer biology & therapy,2019 04 23,"Understanding the mechanisms of chemoresistance in osteosarcoma (OS) cell is important for drug development. By establishment of cisplatin (CDDP) resistant OS cells, we found that the levels of visfatin in OS/CDDP cells were significantly greater than that in their parental cells. The CDDP resistant OS cells showed greater migration and invasion capability than that of parental cells. Knockdown of visfatin can rescue the CDDP sensitivity of resistant OS cells. Among the detected epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs), visfatin can increase the expression of Snail and Zeb-1 in OS cells. Overexpression of Snail and Zeb1 can attenuate si-visfatin reduced CDDP resistance of OS cells. Mechanistical studies indicated that visfatin can increase the mRNA expression of Snail and therefore upregulate its expression via HIF-1α induced transcription. As to Zeb1, visfatin had no effect on its mRNA expression, while significantly increased its protein stability. Furthermore, the upregulation of ATM, which can phosphorylate and stabilize Zeb1, was involved in visfatin-induced Zeb1 expression in OS cells. Collectively, our revealed that visfatin was involved in CDDP resistance of OS cells via upregulation of Snail and Zeb1, suggesting that inhibition of visfatin might be a potential pathway for OS treatment.",Autophagy in Xenopus laevis rod photoreceptors is independently regulated by phototransduction and misfolded RHOP23H.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975014,Autophagy,2019 04 12,"We previously reported autophagic structures in rod photoreceptors expressing a misfolding RHO (rhodopsin) mutant (RHOP23H), suggesting that autophagy may play a role in degrading the mutant RHO and/or be involved in photoreceptor cell death. To further examine autophagy in normal and diseased rods, we generated transgenic Xenopus laevis tadpoles expressing the dually fluorescent autophagy marker mRFP-eGFP-LC3 in rods, which changes from green to yellow and finally red as autophagic structures develop and mature. Using transgenic lines with constitutive and inducible expression, we determined the time-course of autophagy in rod photoreceptors: autophagosomes last for 6 to 8 hours before fusing with lysosomes, and acidified autolysosomes last for about 28 hours before being degraded. Autophagy was diurnally regulated in normal rods, with more autophagic structures generated during periods of light, and this regulation was non-circadian. We also found that more autophagosomes were produced in rods expressing the misfolding RHOP23H mutant. The RHO chromophore absorbs photons to initiate phototransduction, and is consumed in this process; it also promotes RHO folding. To determine whether increased autophagy in light-exposed normal rods is caused by increased RHO misfolding or phototransduction, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the RPE65 and GNAT1 genes, which are essential for chromophore biosynthesis and phototransduction respectively. Both knockouts suppressed light-induced autophagy, indicating that although light and misfolded rhodopsin can both induce autophagy in rods, light-induced autophagy is not due to misfolding of RHO, but rather due to phototransduction.

Therefore, the hospital incidence and in-hospital mortality of patients undergoing open or endovascular surgery for type A ADs ( TAADs ) and type B ADs ( TBADs ) in Germany were analyzed on a nationwide basis between 2006 and 2014. Methods and Results A secondary data analysis of the nationwide diagnosis-related group statistics, compiled by the German Federal Statistical Office, was performed for patients who were surgically/interventionally treated for AD ( International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, German Modification [ ICD -10- GM] codes I71.00-I71.07; n=20 533). By using specific procedure codes, a distinction between TAAD (n=14 911/72.6%) and TBAD (n=5622/27.4%) could be made. The standardized hospital incidence of surgically/interventionally treated AD was 2.7/100 000 per year, comprising 2.0/100 000 per year for TAAD and 0.7/100 000 per year for TBAD . The in-hospital mortality of TAAD was 19.5%; and of TBAD, 9.3%. Both the incidence and in-hospital mortality increased over the 9-year period. The share of endovascularly treated TBAD increased steadily during the same time interval. A multilevel multivariable analysis revealed that, for TAAD , age and comorbidity were significantly associated with a higher mortality risk. The latter was also true for TBAD . Sex was not significantly associated with mortality. A significant association between higher annual center volume and mortality was found for TAAD , but not for TBAD . Conclusions This is the first report on hospital incidence and mortality for surgically/interventionally treated AD on a nationwide basis. Overall, in Germany, hospital incidence and mortality of TAAD and TBAD increased over time. In addition, TAAD is performed more safely in high-volume centers.",Does Public Health Insurance Coverage Lead to Better Health Outcomes? Evidence From Chinese Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975010,"Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2019 04 26,"This article examines the impacts of public health insurance on the health of adults through use of data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We use the endogenous treatment effects model to infer the causal effects of public health insurance on health. We find that public health insurance significantly improves the physical and mental health status of health insurance beneficiaries after controlling for other covariates. Among the 2 types of voluntary public health insurance, the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance has the greater impact in improving health than the New Cooperative Medical Scheme. Moreover, the health effect appears to be stronger for middle-aged individuals, the elderly, and those with lower incomes than for their counterparts. The positive health effects may result from few channels, including the increase of health care utilization, the improvement of health-related behaviors, and the fact that individuals with public health insurance are more likely to use higher level care providers. This study provides implications on reforming China's health care system."

 h. TQ pretreatment reduced levels of serum aminotransferases and increased hepatic glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activities via inhibiting CYP2E1 expression. TQ inhibited JNK, ERK and P38 phosphorylation induced by APAP. Meanwhile, TQ inhibited PI3K/mTOR signaling activation and activated AMPK phosphorylation. Moreover, TQ prevented APAP-induced hepatocytes apoptosis regulated by Bcl-2 and Bax. Furthermore, TQ inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation on APAP-induced acute liver injury.

Currently, temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent that induces DNA strand breaks, is considered the frontline chemotherapeutic agent for GBM. Despite its frontline status, GBM patients commonly exhibit resistance to TMZ treatment. We have recently established and characterized TMZ-resistant human glioma cells. The aim of this study is to investigate whether curcumin modulates cell apoptosis through the alternation of the connexin 43 (Cx43) protein level in TMZ-resistant GBM. Overexpression of Cx43, but not ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), was observed (approximately 2.2-fold) in TMZ-resistant GBM cells compared to the Cx43 levels in parental GBM cells. Furthermore, at a concentration of 10

Concomitant treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) exerted additional effects on Cx43 degradation. Treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (methyladenine) did not affect the curcumin-induced Cx43 degradation. Interestingly, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal) significantly negated the curcumin-induced Cx43 degradation, which suggests that curcumin-induced Cx43 degradation occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",Scutellaria Radix Promotes Apoptosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells via Induction of AMPK-Dependent Autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974965,The American journal of Chinese medicine,2019 05 24,"Scutellaria Radix (SR) is an herb traditionally used in Asian countries to treat inflammatory diseases. Recent studies report that SR exhibits anticancer activities in various types of tumors. In this study, we investigated the apoptotic and autophagic effect of SR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of cancer-associated death. Treatment of SR in two NSCLC cell lines, H358 and H2087 cells resulted in suppressed cell viability. Western blot assays showed increased expressions of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), key factors of apoptosis. Co-treatment of SR with a caspase inhibitor Z-VAD led to nullification of the antiproliferative effect, suggesting the role of apoptosis in the action mechanism of SR. Further experiments revealed autophagy was involved in the effect of SR. SR-treated NSCLC cells expressed increased ratio of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II/LC3-I. When chloroquine was co-treated with SR, this ratio was further increased, indicating SR treatment induced autophagy in NSCLC cells. Interestingly, loss of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) co-treatment suppressed SR-induced apoptosis.

 and P70-S6 kinase in SR-treated H358 and H2087 cells. Under AMPK-inhibited conditions by compound C, SR treatment failed to induce both autophagy and apoptosis. Taken together, this study identifies the positive effect of SR in H358 and H2087 cells by inducing apoptosis via AMPK-dependent autophagy. Thus, our results suggest the potential use of SR as a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients.",Maternal Depression and Breastfeeding Practices in the Maldives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974963,Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2019 04 12,To assess associations between maternal depression and breastfeeding practices in mothers in the Maldives.,High concentration of plasma methoxytyramine: dopamine-producing tumour or Parkinson's disease therapy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974961,Annals of clinical biochemistry,2019 04 12,"Levodopa (L-DOPA) provided to patients with Parkinson's disease causes an increase in dopamine and methoxytyramine blood concentration which may lead to erroneous diagnosis of dopamine-producing tumours based on a plasma fractionated metanephrines and methoxytyramine assay. Considering that oral L-DOPA is mainly transformed in the gut wall into dopamine and methoxytyramine, we hypothesize that patients treated with L-DOPA produce predominantly sulphated methoxytyramine, whereas dopamine-producing tumours, devoid of sulfotransferase, will secrete free methoxytyramine. These metabolic differences may allow for discrimination between the two groups of patients through methoxytyramine plasma concentration.",Ways of coping and HIV disclosure among people living with HIV: mediation of decision self-efficacy and moderation by sex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974958,AIDS care,2019 06 13,"Individuals living with HIV/AIDS face several stressors and use varying strategies to cope. Disclosure (or nondisclosure) of HIV serostatus is an important consideration among individuals living with HIV. However, studies examining the association between coping and HIV disclosure are lacking, and more research examining potential mediators and moderators is needed. The transactional model of stress and coping and the theory of planned behavior may help in understanding the mediating relationship between coping, decision self-efficacy, and HIV disclosure. Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the association between coping and HIV disclosure to sexual partners, assess the mediating role of decision self-efficacy, and examine moderation by sex. Baseline data from 262 individuals living with HIV who participated in a disclosure intervention were used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to assess sociodemographic characteristics. Principal component analysis was used to operationalize coping. Path analysis was then used to determine the mediating role of decision self-efficacy in the association between overall, adaptive, distancing, and attack/escape avoidance coping and HIV disclosure to sexual partners. After adjusting for age and time since diagnosis, direct associations between coping and decision self-efficacy, and decision self-efficacy and disclosure behavior varied by sex. Among the overall study population, decision self-efficacy mediated the associations between adaptive coping (β = 0.064, p = 0.003), attack/escape avoidance coping (β = -0.052, p = 0.009) and disclosure behavior. Disclosure intervention programs geared towards populations living with HIV should include decision self-efficacy and adaptive coping, and attenuate attack/escape avoidance coping.",The clinical- and cost-effectiveness of functional electrical stimulation and ankle-foot orthoses for foot drop in Multiple Sclerosis: a multicentre randomized trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974955,Clinical rehabilitation,2019 04 12,To compare the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) over 12 months in people with Multiple Sclerosis with foot drop.,Age- and sex-specific first health care use for migraine in 2016 in children and adolescents from prospectively collected health insurance data in Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974953,Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,2019 04 12,Migraine in children and adolescents is associated with significant disability and a high risk of persistence into adulthood.,Auricular Reconstructive Surgery Improvement to the Firmin Technique for Placing an Earring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974952,The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association,2019 04 12,"Microtia has an incidence of 1 in 7000 to 8000 births.

Although good practices for characterization have already been discussed, little is known about how assays are affected by specific conjugation parameters. Results: Here we developed, characterized and screened a toolset of bioconjugates that provided new insights about the optimization of conjugated critical reagent attributes. Biotinylated and sulfo-tagged trastuzumab were utilized as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, in an antidrug antibody (ADA) assay. The optimal conjugation window was identified by functional assessment. Excess of unlabeled biotin, but not sulfo-tag, affected the assay performance. An increase in the assay baseline was observed when sulfo-tagged trastuzumab underwent increasing freeze-thaw cycles. Conclusion: Upfront systematic screening and characterization of conjugated critical reagent attributes benefit assay robustness."

These ligands are exchanged on CdSe NPLs with halides that act as X-L-type ligands. These CdSe NPLs are costabilized by amines to provide colloidal stability in nonpolar solvents. The hydrogen from the amine can participate in a hydrogen bond with the lone pair electrons of surface halides. After ligand exchange, the optical features are red-shifted. Thus, ligand tuning is another way, in addition to confinement, to tune the optical features of NPLs. The improved surface passivation leads to an increase in the fluorescence quantum efficiency of up to 70% in the case of bromide. However, for chloride and iodide, the surface coverage is incomplete, and thus, the fluorescence quantum efficiency is lower. This ligand exchange is associated with a decrease in stress that leads to unfolding of the NPLs, which is particularly noticeable for iodide-capped NPLs.","Stable, Efficient Near-Infrared Light-Emitting Diodes Enabled by α/δ Phase Modulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974937,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 05 02,"Although formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite shows excellent prospects in the field of optoelectronics, it is limited by the conversion of the black perovskite phase (α-FAPbI3) to the yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-FAPbI3). Here, we first introduce diamine cations [EDBE, 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine)] into FAPbI3 for stable and efficient near-infrared perovskite light-emitting diodes (NIR PeLEDs). By rationally regulating the α/δ phase, we have successfully prepared a NIR PeLED with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ≤11.40%. In addition, the perovskite film has excellent stability and does not undergo any significant change after being in air for 270 days. These results show that the introduction of EDBE reduces the formation energy of α-FAPbI3 perovskite and the hydrogen bonds formed between adjacent EDBE molecules increase the stability of the perovskite devices. This work could help guide the phase transition mechanism of FAPbI3 and further improve the performance of LEDs.",A Natural 2D Heterostructure [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4][Au xTe2- x] with Large Transverse Nonsaturating Negative Magnetoresistance and High Electron Mobility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974936,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 08,"We report the two-dimensional (2D) natural heterostructure [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4][Au xTe2- x] ( x = 0.52-0.36) which shows anomalous, transverse nonsaturating negative magnetoresistance (MR). For x = 0.52, the material has a commensurately modulated structure with alternating [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4] rocksalt layers and atomically thin [Au xTe2- x] sheets, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction using a (3 + 1)-dimensional space group; for other x compositions, the modulated structure is absent and the Au and Te atoms are disordered. The transport properties in this system at low temperature (<100 K) are dominated by an unusual 2D hopping mechanism, while at room temperature a high carrier mobility of ∼1352 cm2 V-1 s-1 is obtained ( x = 0.36). The confined electrons within the [Au xTe2- x] layers are also exposed to interlayer coupling with the insulating [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4] layers, and as a result, the properties of the heterostructures emerge not only from the constituent layers but also the interactions between them. Furthermore, the various Au and Te coordination patterns found in the [Au xTe2- x] sheets as a function of x further contribute to a unique electronic structure that leads to the anomalous nonsaturating negative MR with different field dependent behaviors. First-principles calculations indicate that the [Au xTe2- x] sheets are responsible for the unusual electrical transport properties in this 2D system.",Photoinduced Doping To Enable Tunable and High-Performance Anti-Ambipolar MoTe2/MoS2 Heterotransistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974935,ACS nano,2019 05 29,"van der Waals (vdW) p-n heterojunctions formed by two-dimensional nanomaterials exhibit many physical properties and deliver functionalities to enable future electronic and optoelectronic devices.

The device demonstrates a high on/off ratio of 105 with a large on-state current of several micro-amps. The peak position of the drain-source current in the transfer curve can be adjusted through the doping level across a large dynamic range.

The microelectrodes are utilized to study the effect of carboxylic acid side-chain length on the conductivity curve profiles in aqueous buffer with different pH. The conductivity shifts due to the buffer pH are effected by the length of the carboxylic acid side-chains. The shifts can be explained by the carboxylic acid dissociation property (pKa) at the solid-liquid interface, self-doping effect, and effective conjugation length.

The nanocellulose were obtained through acid hydrolysis. The properties of the different nanobiocomposites were comparatively evaluated, including their barrier and mechanical properties. The nanocrystals obtained for coconut shell (CS), corn husk (CH), and corncob (CC) presented a length / diameter ratio of 40.18, 40.86, and 32.19, respectively.

One commonality shared among these pathogens is their ubiquitous presence, robust host-colonization and most importantly, resistance to antibiotics. A significant number of two-component systems (TCSs) exist in these pathogens, which are involved in regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals such as antibiotic exposure. While the development of antimicrobial resistance is a complex phenomenon, it has been shown that TCSs are involved in sensing antibiotics and regulating genes associated with antibiotic resistance. In this review, we aim to interpret current knowledge about the signaling mechanisms of TCSs in these three pathogenic bacteria.

Previous studies have suggested that the prokaryotic cellulose synthase gene (CesA) was horizontally transferred into the genome of a tunicate ancestor. However, no convenient tools have been devised to determine whether only tunicates harbor CesA. ORTHOSCOPE is a recently developed tool used to identify orthologous genes and to examine the phylogenic relationship of molecules within major metazoan taxa. The present analysis with this tool revealed the presence of CesA orthologs in all sequenced tunicate genomes but an absence in other metazoan genomes.

ER stress sensors PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 play a central role in the initiation and regulation of the UPR; they inhibit novel protein synthesis and upregulate ER chaperones, such as protein disulfide isomerase, to remove unfolded proteins. However, when recovery from ER stress is difficult, the UPR pathway is activated to eliminate unhealthy cells. This signaling transition is the key event of many human diseases. However, the precise mechanisms are largely unknown. Intriguingly, reactive electrophilic species (RES), which exist in the environment or are produced through cellular metabolism, have been identified as a key player of this transition. In this review, we focused on the function of representative RES: nitric oxide (NO) as a gaseous RES, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as a lipid RES, and methylmercury (MeHg) as an environmental organic compound RES, to outline the relationship between ER stress and RES. Modulation by RES might be a target for the development of next-generation therapy for ER stress-associated diseases."

Among these we selected highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergenic, and immunogenic B-cell epitopes. Five epitopes (2, 6, 8, 10, and 11 corresponding to Pla regions 52-60, 146-150, 231-234, 286-295, and 306-311, respectively) could be the first choice for the development of the new generation of target-peptide-based vaccine against plague. The partial residues of omptin epitopes 6, 8, and 10 (regions 136-145, 227-230, and 274-285) could be promising targets for the multi-pathogen vaccine against a group of enterobacterial infections. The comparative analysis and 3D modeling of amino acid sequences of several omptin family proteases, such as Pla (Yersinia pestis), PgtE (Salmonella enterica), SopA (Shigella flexneri), OmpT, and OmpP (Escherichia coli), confirmed their high cross-homology with respect to the identified epitope clusters and possible involvement of individual epitopes in host-pathogen interaction.",An Analysis of the Attitude Estimation Errors Caused by the Deflections of Vertical in the Integration of Rotational INS and GNSS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974890,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"This paper investigates the attitude estimation errors caused by the deflections of vertical (DOV) in the case of a rotational inertial navigation system (INS) integrated with a global satellite navigation system (GNSS). It has been proved theoretically and experimentally that the DOV can introduce a tilt error to the INS/GNSS integration, whereas less attention has been given to its effect to the heading estimation. In fact, due to the intercoupling characteristic of attitude errors, the heading estimation of an INS/GNSS integrated navigation system can also be affected. In this paper, first, the attitude estimation errors caused by DOV were deduced based on the INS's error propagation functions. Then, the corresponding simulations were conducted and the results were well consistent with the theoretical analysis. Finally, a real shipborne marine test was organized with the aimed to verify the effect of DOV on attitude estimation in the rotational INS/GNSS integration, whereas the global gravity model was used for DOV compensation. The results with DOV compensation were compared with the corresponding results where the compensation was not used and showed that the heading estimation errors caused by DOV could exceed 20 arcsecs, which must be considered in high-precision application cases.",Low-Temperature Vapor-Phase Synthesis of Single-Crystalline Gold Nanostructures: Toward Exceptional Electrocatalytic Activity for Methanol Oxidation Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974889,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Au nanostructures (Au NSs) have been considered promising materials for applications in fuel cell catalysis, electrochemistry, and plasmonics. For the fabrication of high-performance Au NS-based electronic or electrochemical devices, Au NSs should have clean surfaces and be directly supported on a substrate without any mediating molecules. Herein, we report the vapor-phase synthesis of Au NSs on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate at 120 °C and their application to the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). By employing AuCl as a precursor, the synthesis temperature for Au NSs was reduced to under 200 °C, enabling the direct synthesis of Au NSs on an FTO substrate in the vapor phase. Considering that previously reported vapor-phase synthesis of Au NSs requires a high temperature over 1000 °C, this proposed synthetic method is remarkably simple and practical. Moreover, we could selectively synthesize Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nanoplates by adjusting the location of the substrate, and the size of the Au NPs was controllable by changing the reaction temperature. The synthesized Au NSs are a single-crystalline material with clean surfaces that achieved a high methanol oxidation current density of 14.65 mA/cm² when intimately supported by an FTO substrate. We anticipate that this novel synthetic method can widen the applicability of vapor-phase synthesized Au NSs for electronic and electrochemical devices.",Silicon Isotope Geochemistry: Fractionation Linked to Silicon Complexations and Its Geological Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974887,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"The fundamental advances in silicon isotope geochemistry have been systematically demonstrated in this work. Firstly, the continuous modifications in analytical approaches and the silicon isotope variations in major reservoirs and geological processes have been briefly introduced. Secondly, the silicon isotope fractionation linked to silicon complexation/coordination and thermodynamic conditions have been extensively stressed, including silicate minerals with variable structures and chemical compositions, silica precipitation and diagenesis, chemical weathering of crustal surface silicate rocks, biological uptake, global oceanic Si cycle, etc. Finally, the relevant geological implications for meteorites and planetary core formation, ore deposits formation, hydrothermal fluids activities, and silicon cycling in hydrosphere have been summarized. Compared to the thermodynamic isotope fractionation of silicon associated with high-temperature processes, that in low-temperature geological processes is much more significant (e.g., chemical weathering, biogenic/non-biogenic precipitation, biological uptake, adsorption, etc.). The equilibrium silicon isotope fractionation during the mantle-core differentiation resulted in the observed heavy isotope composition of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). The equilibrium fractionation of silicon isotopes among silicate minerals are sensitive to the Si-O bond length, Si coordination numbers (CN), the polymerization degrees of silicate unites, and the electronegativity of cations in minerals. The preferential enrichment of different speciation of dissoluble Si (DSi) (e.g., silicic acid H₄SiO₄⁰ (H4) and H₃SiO₄- (H3)) in silica precipitation and diagenesis, and chemical weathering, lead to predominately positive Si isotope signatures in continental surface waters, in which the dynamic fractionation of silicon isotope could be well described by the Rayleigh fractionation model. The role of complexation in biological fractionations of silicon isotopes is more complicated, likely involving several enzymatic processes and active transport proteins. The integrated understanding greatly strengthens the potential of δ30Si proxy for reconstructing the paleo terrestrial and oceanic environments, and exploring the meteorites and planetary core formation, as well as constraining ore deposits and hydrothermal fluid activity.",Immunoproteomic Lessons for Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine Design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974886,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Accurate antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses require prior recognition of antigenic peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Both the helper and the cytotoxic immune responses are critical for the control and the clearance of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection, which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infected pediatric, immunocompromised and elderly populations. In this article we review the immunoproteomics studies which have defined the general antigen processing and presentation rules that determine both the immunoprevalence and the immunodominance of the cellular immune response to HRSV. Mass spectrometry and functional analyses have shown that the HLA class I and II cellular immune responses against HRSV are mainly focused on three viral proteins: fusion, matrix, and nucleoprotein. Thus, these studies have important implications for vaccine development against this virus, since a vaccine construct including these three relevant HRSV proteins could efficiently stimulate the major components of the adaptive immune system: humoral, helper, and cytotoxic effector immune responses.",Bayes Factor-Based Regulatory Gene Network Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Study of Economic Traits in a Purebred Swine Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974885,Genes,2019 06 10,": Early stage prediction of economic trait performance is important and directly linked to profitability of farm pig production. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been applied to find causative genomic regions of traits. This study established a regulatory gene network using GWAS for critical economic pig characteristics, centered on easily measurable body fat thickness in live animals. We genotyped 2,681 pigs using Illumina Porcine SNP60, followed by GWAS to calculate Bayes factors for 47,697 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of seven traits. Using this information, SNPs were annotated with specific genes near genome locations to establish the association weight matrix. The entire network consisted of 226 nodes and 6,921 significant edges. For in silico validation of their interactions, we conducted regulatory sequence analysis of predicted target genes of transcription factors (TFs). Three key regulatory TFs were identified to guarantee maximum coverage: AT-rich interaction domain 3B (ARID3B), glial cell missing homolog 1 (GCM1), and GLI family zinc finger 2 (GLI2). We identified numerous genes targeted by ARID3B, associated with cellular processes. GCM1 and GLI2 were involved in developmental processes, and their shared target genes regulated multicellular organismal process. This system biology-based function analysis might contribute to enhancing understanding of economic pig traits.",Enhancement of Light Extraction Efficiency for InGaN/GaN Light-Emitting Diodes Using Silver Nanoparticle Embedded ZnO Thin Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974884,Micromachines,2019 06 10,"In this study, we propose a liquid-phase-deposited silver nanoparticle embedded ZnO (LPD-Ag NP/ZnO) thin film at room temperature to improve the light extraction efficiency (LEE) for InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The treatment solution for the deposition of the LPD-Ag/NP ZnO thin film comprised a ZnO-powder-saturated HCl and a silver nitrate (AgNO₃) aqueous solution. The enhanced LEE of an InGaN/GaN LED with the LPD-Ag NP/ZnO window layer can be attributed to the surface texture and localized surface plasmon (LSP) coupling effect. The surface texture of the LPD-Ag/NP ZnO window layer relies on the AgNO₃ concentration, which decides the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the thin film. The LSP resonance or extinction wavelength also depends on the concentration of AgNO₃, which determines the Ag NP size and content of Ag atoms in the LPD-Ag NP/ZnO thin film. The AgNO₃ concentration for the optimal LEE of an InGaN/GaN LED with an LPD-Ag NP/ZnO window layer occurs at 0.05 M, which demonstrates an increased light output intensity that is approximately 1.52 times that of a conventional InGaN/GaN LED under a 20-mA driving current.",Secretory Nanoparticles of Neospora caninum Profilin-Fused with the Transmembrane Domain of GP64 from Silkworm Hemolymph.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974883,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Neosporosis, which is caused by Neospora caninum, is a well-known disease in the veterinary field. Infections in pregnant cattle lead to abortion via transplacental (congenitally from mother to fetus) transmission. In this study, a N. caninum profilin (NcPROF), was expressed in silkworm larvae by recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) bacmid and was purified from the hemolymph. Three NcPROF constructs were investigated, native NcPROF fused with an N-terminal PA tag (PA-NcPROF), PA-NcPROF fused with the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori (bx-PA-NcPROF), and bx-PA-NcPROF with additional C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV (bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM). All recombinant proteins were observed extra- and intracellularly in cultured Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was partly abnormally secreted, even though it has the transmembrane domain, and only it was pelleted by ultracentrifugation, but PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. Additionally, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified from silkworm hemolymph by anti-PA agarose beads while PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. The purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM protein bound to its receptor, mouse Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR-11), and formed unique nanoparticles. These results suggest that profilin fused with GP64TM was secreted as a nanoparticle with binding affinity to its receptor and this nanoparticle formation is advantageous for the development of vaccines to N. caninum.","The Comprehensive Roles of ATRANORIN, A Secondary Metabolite from the Antarctic Lichen Stereocaulon caespitosum, in HCC Tumorigenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974882,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly genetic diseases, but surprisingly chemotherapeutic approaches against HCC are only limited to a few targets. In particular, considering the difficulty of a chemotherapeutic drug development in terms of cost and time enforces searching for surrogates to minimize effort and maximize efficiency in anti-cancer therapy. In spite of the report that approximately one thousand lichen-derived metabolites have been isolated, the knowledge about their functions and consequences in cancer development is relatively limited. Moreover, one of the major second metabolites from lichens, Atranorin has never been studied in HCC. Regarding this, we comprehensively analyze the effect of Atranorin by employing representative HCC cell lines and experimental approaches. Cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis using the compound consistently show the inhibitory effects of Atranorin. Moreover, cell death determination using Annexin-V and (Propidium Iodide) PI staining suggests that it induces cell death through necrosis. Lastly, the metastatic potential of HCC cell lines is significantly inhibited by the drug. Taken these together, we claim a novel functional finding that Atranorin comprehensively suppresses HCC tumorigenesis and metastatic potential, which could provide an important basis for anti-cancer therapeutics.",Early Blood Biomarkers to Improve Sepsis/Bacteremia Diagnostics in Pediatric Emergency Settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974881,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 10,"Background: Sepsis is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Early recognition and treatment are essential for preventing progression to lethal outcomes. CRP and Complete Blood Count (CBC) are the initial preferred tests to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. Specific early diagnostic markers are still missing. Aim: To investigate diagnostic value of Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) and Platelet-MPV ratio (PLT/MPV) to distinguish sepsis/bacteremia and viral infection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of case records of 115 children from 1 month to 5 years of age. All cases were divided into two groups-sepsis/bacteremia (n = 68) and viral (n = 47) patients, and further subdivided according to the time of arrival into early or late (≤12 or 12-48 h post the onset of fever, respectively). Analysis of CBC and CRP results was performed. NLR and PLT/MPV were calculated. Results: Sepsis/bacteremia group demonstrated higher absolute platelets count (370.15 ± 134.65 × 10⁸/L versus 288.91 ± 107.14 × 10⁸/L; p = 0.001), NLR (2.69 ± 2.03 versus 1.83 ± 1.70; p = 0.006), and PLT/MPV (41.42 ± 15.86 versus 33.45 ± 17.97; p = 0.001). PLT/MPV was increased in early arrival sepsis/bacteremia infants (42.70 ± 8.57 versus 31.01 ± 8.21; p = 0.008). NLR and MPV were significantly lower in infants (≤12 months) with viral infection on late arrival (1.16 ± 1.06 versus 1.90 ± 1.25, p = 0.025 for NLR and 8.94 ± 0.95fl versus 9.44 ± 0.85fl, p = 0.046 for MPV). Conclusion: Together with standard blood biomarkers, such as CRP, neutrophils, or platelets count, PLT/MPV is a promising biomarker for clinical practice to help discriminate between viral disease or sepsis/bacteremia in all children, especially in early onset of symptoms. NLR and MPV could support exclusion of sepsis/bacteremia in late arrival cases."

Recent advances in bioimaging techniques have enabled to visualize ERK activity in real-time at the single-cell level. Emerging evidence from such approaches suggests unexpectedly complex spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK activity in living cells and animals and their crucial roles in determining cellular responses.

Their bizarre morphology, together with conflicting results of molecular studies, has nevertheless made their classification ambiguous. Furthermore, their limited dispersal capability (due to the primarily absence of wings) and their euedaphic lifestyle have greatly complicated species-level identification. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers have been applied herein to investigate and summarize proturan systematics at different hierarchical levels. Two new mitochondrial genomes are described and included in a phylum-level phylogenetic analysis, but the position of Protura could not be resolved with confidence due to an accelerated rate of substitution and extensive gene rearrangements. Mitochondrial and nuclear loci were also applied in order to revise the intra-class systematics, recovering three proturan orders and most of the families/subfamilies included as monophyletic, with the exception of the subfamily Acerentominae. At the species level, most morphologically described species were confirmed using molecular markers, with some exceptions, and the advantages of including nuclear, as well as mitochondrial, markers and morphology are discussed. At all levels, an enlarged taxon sampling and the integration of data from different sources may be of significant help in solving open questions that still persist on the evolutionary history of Protura.",Microbes in Cahoots with Plants: MIST to Hit the Jackpot of Agricultural Productivity during Drought.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974865,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Drought conditions marked by water deficit impede plant growth thus causing recurrent decline in agricultural productivity. Presently, research efforts are focussed towards harnessing the potential of microbes to enhance crop production during drought. Microbial communities, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) buddy up with plants to boost crop productivity during drought via microbial induced systemic tolerance (MIST). The present review summarizes MIST mechanisms during drought comprised of modulation in phytohormonal profiles, sturdy antioxidant defence, osmotic grapnel, bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) or AMF glomalin production, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), expression of fungal aquaporins and stress responsive genes, which alters various physiological processes such as hydraulic conductance, transpiration rate, stomatal conductivity and photosynthesis in host plants. Molecular studies have revealed microbial induced differential expression of various genes such as ERD15 (Early Response to Dehydration 15), RAB18 (ABA-responsive gene) in Arabidopsis, COX1 (regulates energy and carbohydrate metabolism), PKDP (protein kinase), AP2-EREBP (stress responsive pathway), Hsp20, bZIP1 and COC1 (chaperones in ABA signalling) in Pseudomonas fluorescens treated rice, LbKT1, LbSKOR (encoding potassium channels) in Lycium, PtYUC3 and PtYUC8 (IAA biosynthesis) in AMF inoculated Poncirus, ADC, AIH, CPA, SPDS, SPMS and SAMDC (polyamine biosynthesis) in PGPR inoculated Arabidopsis, 14-3-3 genes (TFT1-TFT12 genes in ABA signalling pathways) in AMF treated Solanum, ACO, ACS (ethylene biosynthesis), jasmonate MYC2 gene in chick pea, PR1 (SA regulated gene), pdf1.2 (JA marker genes) and VSP1 (ethylene-response gene) in Pseudomonas treated Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, the key role of miRNAs in MIST has also been recorded in Pseudomonas putida RA treated chick pea plants.",Microrna-130a Downregulates HCV Replication through an atg5-Dependent Autophagy Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974864,Cells,2019 06 10,"We previously identified that miR-130a downregulates HCV replication through two independent pathways: restoration of host immune responses and regulation of pyruvate metabolism. In this study, we further sought to explore host antiviral target genes regulated by miR-130a. We performed a RT² Profiler™ PCR array to identify the host antiviral genes regulated by miR-130a. The putative binding sites between miR-130a and its downregulated genes were predicted by miRanda. miR-130a and predicted target genes were over-expressed or knocked down by siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA. Selected gene mRNAs and their proteins, together with HCV replication in JFH1 HCV-infected Huh7.5.1 cells were monitored by qRT-PCR and Western blot. We identified 32 genes that were significantly differentially expressed more than 1.5-fold following miR-130a overexpression, 28 of which were upregulated and 4 downregulated. We found that ATG5, a target gene for miR-130a, significantly upregulated HCV replication and downregulated interferon stimulated gene expression. miR-130a downregulated ATG5 expression and its conjugation complex with ATG12. ATG5 and ATG5-ATG12 complex affected interferon stimulated gene (ISG) such as MX1 and OAS3 expression and subsequently HCV replication. We concluded that miR-130a regulates host antiviral response and HCV replication through targeting ATG5 via the ATG5-dependent autophagy pathway.","Differences in Eye Health, Access to Eye Care Specialists and Use of Lenses among Immigrant and Native-Born Workers in Spain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974863,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Latin American immigrants make up 49% of the total immigrant population in Spain, yet little is known about their eye health. The aim of this study is to determine if there are differences in self-perceived eye health, access to eye care specialists, and use of lenses between a sample of Latin American immigrant workers from Colombia and Ecuador, and native-born workers in Spain. We used data from the PELFI cohort (Project for Longitudinal Studies of Immigrant Families). The sample consisted of 179 immigrant workers born in Colombia or Ecuador, and 83 Spanish-born workers. The outcome variables were self-perceived eye health, access to eye specialists, and use of lenses. A descriptive analysis of the sample was carried out, and the prevalence of the three outcome variables in immigrants and natives was calculated and adjusted for explanatory variables. Random effects logistic regression models examined eye health outcomes by workers' country of birth. Immigrants are less likely to report poor self-perceived eye health than native-born (ORc 0.46; CI 95%, 0.22-0.96). Furthermore, they have less access to specialists (ORc 2.61; CI 95%, 1.32-5.15) and a higher probability of needing lenses but not having them (ORc 14.14; CI 95%, 1.77-112.69). This latter variable remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (ORa 34.05; CI 95%, 1.59-729.04). Latin American immigrants may not value the use of lenses, despite eye care specialists indicating that they need them.

Their function is controlled by core gene networks whose misregulation can result in aberrant stem cell function and defects of regeneration or neoplasia. HOX genes are master regulators of cell identity and cell fate during embryonic development. They play a crucial role in embryonic stem cell differentiation into specific lineages and their expression is maintained in adult stem cells along differentiation hierarchies. Aberrant HOX gene expression is found in several cancers where they can function as either oncogenes by sustaining cell proliferation or tumor-suppressor genes by controlling cell differentiation. Emerging evidence shows that abnormal expression of HOX genes is involved in the transformation of adult stem cells into cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells have been identified in most malignancies and proved to be responsible for cancer initiation, recurrence, and metastasis. In this review, we consider the role of HOX genes in normal and cancer stem cells and discuss how the modulation of HOX gene function could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target cancer stem cells to halt tumor initiation, progression, and resistance to treatment.",LC/MS-Based Polar Metabolite Profiling Identified Unique Biomarker Signatures for Cervical Cancer and Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Using Global and Targeted Metabolomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974861,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Cervical cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers among females worldwide. Therefore, it is important to discover new biomarkers for early diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, preferably non-invasive ones. In the present study, we aimed to identify unique metabolic signatures for CINs and cervical cancers using global and targeted metabolomic profiling. Plasma samples (69 normal, 55 CIN1, 42 CIN2/3, and 60 cervical cancer) were examined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Metabolic pathways were analyzed using the integrated web-based tool MetaboAnalyst. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the combined association of metabolites and human papillomavirus (HPV) status with the risk of cervical carcinogenesis. A total of 28 metabolites exhibiting discriminating levels among normal, CIN, and cervical cancer patients (Kruskal-Wallis test p < 0.05) were identified in the global profiling analysis. The pathway analysis showed significantly altered alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolic pathways (FDR p-value < 0.05) in both the discovery and validation phases. Seven metabolites (AMP, aspartate, glutamate, hypoxanthine, lactate, proline, and pyroglutamate) were discriminated between CINs and cervical cancer versus normal (area under the curve (AUC) value > 0.8). The levels of these metabolites were significantly high in patients versus normal (p < 0.0001) and were associated with increased risk of developing CIN2/3 and cervical cancer. Additionally, elevated levels of the seven metabolites combined with positive HPV status were correlated with substantial risk of cancer progression. These results demonstrated that metabolomics profiling is capable of distinguishing CINs and cervical cancers from normal and highlighted potential biomarkers for the early detection of cervical carcinogenesis.",Effect of Dietary Incorporation of Linseed Alone or Together with Tomato-Red Pepper Mix on Laying Hens' Egg Yolk Fatty Acids Profile and Health Lipid Indexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974860,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"This study evaluated the effect of linseed incorporation in laying hens' feed (alone or along with a tomato-red pepper mix) on laying hens' egg yolk fatty acids profile, as well as on their atherogenic (IA) and thrombogenic (IT) health lipid indexes, and the ratio between the hypocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (HH). Sixty 27 weeks-old Novogen White laying hens were divided into three groups and given 100 g/hen/day of a standard diet (Control, C) containing 4.5% of ground linseed (Linseed diet, L), containing 1% of dried tomato paste and 1% sweet red pepper (Lineseeds-Tomato-Pepper, LTP). The linseed dietary inclusion significantly reduced the egg yolk content of palmitic acid from 25.41% (C) to 23.43% (L) and that of stearic acid from 14.75% (C) to 12.52% (L). Feeding 4.5% ground linseed did not affect the egg yolk content of α-Linolenic acid but significantly increased the egg yolk concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from 0.011% (C) to 0.047% (L) and that of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from 1.94% (C) to 2.73% (L). The IA and the HH were not affected (p > 0.05) by the dietary addition of linseed, whereas the IT decreased (p < 0.05) from 1.16 (C) to 0.86 (L).

As such, it has attracted attention from medical, automatic, and aerospace fields. In this paper, the influence of short carbon fibers (SCFs) and the orthogonal building orientation on the flexural properties of printed polyether ether ketone (PEEK) composites are systematically studied. The results show that the addition of SCFs raises the uniform nucleation process of PEEK during 3D printing, decreases the layer-to-layer bonding strength, and greatly changes the fracture mode. The flexural strength of vertically printed PEEK and its CF-reinforced composites show strengths that are as high as molded composites. X-ray micro-computed tomography reveals the microstructure of the printed composites and the transformation of pores during bending tests, which provides evidence for the good mechanical properties of the vertically printed composites. The effect of multi-scale factors on the mechanical properties of the composites, such as crystallization in different positions, layer-by-layer bonding, and porosity, provide a successful interpretation of their fracture modes. This work provides a promising and cost-effective method to fabricate 3D printed composites with tailored, orientation-dependent properties.",Phylogenetic Community Structure and Niche Differentiation in Termites of the Tropical Dry Forests of Colombia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974858,Insects,2019 06 10,"The mechanisms that structure species communities are still debated.

Using biodiversity and environmental data, combined with phylogenetic community analyses, trait mapping, and stable isotopes studies, we investigated the termite community composition of three protected dry forests in Colombia. Our data suggest that the structuring mechanisms differed between sites. Phylogenetic overdispersion of termite assemblages correlated with decreasing rainfall and elevation and increasing temperature. Food niche traits-classified as feeding groups and quantified by δ15N‰ and δ13C‰ isotope signatures-were phylogenetically conserved. Hence, the overdispersion pattern implies increasing interspecific competition with decreasing drier and warmer conditions, which is also supported by fewer species occurring at the driest site. Our results are in line with a hypothesis that decreased biomass production limits resource availability for termites, which leads to competition. Along with this comes a diet shift: termites from drier plots had higher δ13C signatures, reflecting higher δ13C values in the litter and more C4 plants. Our study shows how a phylogenetic community approach combined with trait analyses can contribute to gaining the first insights into mechanisms structuring whole termite assemblages."

This is a retrospective and descriptive cohort study of 8162 NTS positive samples collected in 0-17-year-olds from the Queensland public hospital pathology database (Auslab) over a 20-year period from 1997 to 2016. There were 2951 (36.2%) positive NTS samples collected in tropical zones and 5211 (63.8%) in the sub-tropical zones of Queensland, with a total of 8162 over the region. The tropical zone contributed a disproportionately higher number of positive NTS samples by population sub-analysis. Of the specimens collected, 7421 (90.92%) were faecal, 505 (6.2%) blood, 161 (1.97%) urine, 13 (0.16%) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 62 of other origin. Other categories of specimen types isolated include swab, fluid, aspirate, lavage, bone, tissue, isolate and pus, and these were not included in sub-analysis. The most commonly identified serovars were Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Virchow and Salmonella Saintpaul.

We explored whether NLR predicted the survival of patients with HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and developed a predictive model. In total, 1697 patients with HCC undergoing TACE as first-line therapy at two university hospitals were enrolled (derivation set n = 921, internal validation set n = 395, external validation set n = 381). The tumor size, tumor number, AFP level, vascular invasion, Child-Pugh score, objective response after TACE, and NLR, selected as predictors of overall survival (OS) via multivariate Cox's regression model, were incorporated into a 14-point risk prediction model (SNAVCORN score). The time-dependent areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for OS at 1, 3, and 5 years predicted by the SNAVCORN score were 0.812, 0.734, and 0.700 in the derivation set. Patients were stratified into three risk groups by SNAVCORN score (low, 0-4; intermediate, 5-9; high, 10-14). Compared with the low-risk group, the intermediate-risk (HR 3.10, p < 0.001) and high-risk (HR 7.37, p < 0.001) groups exhibited significantly greater mortality. The prognostic performance of the SNAVCORN score including NLR in patients with HCC treated with TACE was remarkable, much better than those of the conventional scores. The SNAVCORN score will guide future HCC treatment decisions.",Sesbania Gum-Supported Hydrophilic Electrospun Fibers Containing Nanosilver with Superior Antibacterial Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974842,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this contribution, we report for the first time on a new strategy for developing sesbania gum-supported hydrophilic fibers containing nanosilver using electrospinning (SG-Ag/PAN electrospun fibers), which gives the fibers superior antibacterial activity. Employing a series of advanced technologies-scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle testing-we characterized the as-synthesized SG-Ag/PAN electrospun fibers in terms of morphology, size, surface state, chemical composition, and hydrophilicity. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, in particular the feed ratio of sesbania gum (SG) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to Ag nanoparticles (NPs), we regulated the morphology and size of the as-electrospun fibers. The fibers' antibacterial properties were examined using the colony-counting method with two model bacteria: Escherichia coli (a Gram-negative bacterium) and Staphylococcus aureus (a Gram-positive bacterium). Interestingly, compared to Ag/PAN and SG-PAN electrospun fibers, the final SG-Ag/PAN showed enhanced antibacterial activity towards both of the model bacteria due to the combination of antibacterial Ag NPs and hydrophilic SG, which enabled the fibers to have sufficient contact with the bacteria. We believe this strategy has great potential for applications in antibacterial-related fields.","Calreticulin as A Novel Potential Metastasis-Associated Protein in Myxoid Liposarcoma, as Revealed by Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974841,Proteomes,2019 04 12,"Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is a mesenchymal malignancy. To identify innovate seeds for clinical applications, we examined the proteomes of primary tumor tissues from 10 patients with MLS with different statuses of postoperative metastasis. The protein expression profiles of tumor tissues were created, and proteins with differential expression associated with postoperative metastasis were identified by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. The validation was performed using specific antibodies and in vitro analyses. Using 2D-DIGE, we observed 1726 protein species and identified proteins with unique expression levels in metastatic MLS. We focused on the overexpression of calreticulin in metastatic MLS. The higher expression of calreticulin was confirmed by Western blotting, and gene silencing assays demonstrated that reduced expression of calreticulin inhibited cell growth and invasion. Our findings suggested the important roles of calreticulin in MLS metastasis and supported its potential utility as a prognostic biomarker in MLS. Further investigations of the functional properties of calreticulin and other proteins identified in this study will improve our understanding of the biology of MLS and facilitate novel clinical applications.",Surface-Modified Biochar with Polydentate Binding Sites for the Removal of Cadmium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974840,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"In this study, a surface chemical-modified rice husk biochar with abundant amino groups and disulfide bonds for the removal of cadmium was prepared using cystamine dihydrochloride as a modification ligand and glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. The biochars were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), and nitrogen sorption (BET) before and after modification. The adsorption properties of the modified biochars for Cd (II) were investigated in detail via adsorption isotherm models, adsorption kinetics models, and selective adsorption experiments. The surfaces of the cystamine-modified biochars with granular nanopolymers of sufficient functional groups of primary amine and disulfide linkage rendered the biochar surface more conducive to electrostatic attraction and surface complexation. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of the modified biochars (81.02 mg g-1) was almost 10-fold greater than that of the raw biochars (8.347 mg g-1) for Cd (II). Besides, the cystamine-modified biochars had a better affinity for Cd (II) compared to other heavy metals (Zn, As, Cd, Co, Ni, Cr), showing six-fold greater affinity for Cd (II) than Zn2+. The results of this study indicate that the modification of biochars derived from rice husks shows great potential in the removal of Cd (II) from contaminated water.",A Multiscale Model of Oxidation Kinetics for Cu-Based Oxygen Carrier in Chemical Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974839,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Copper oxide is one of the promising oxygen carrier materials in chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) technology, cycling between Cu₂O and CuO. In this study, a multiscale model was developed to describe the oxidation kinetics of the Cu-based oxygen carrier particle with oxygen, including surface, grain, and particle scale. It was considered that the solid product grows with the morphology of disperse islands on the grain surface, and O₂ contacts with two different kinds of grain surfaces in the grain scale model, that is, Cu₂O surface (solid reactant surface) and CuO surface (solid product surface). The two-stage behavior of the oxidation reaction of the Cu-based oxygen carrier was predicted successfully using the developed model, and the model results showed good agreement with experimental data in the literature. The effects of oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and particle structure on the oxidation performance were analyzed. The modeling results indicated that the transition of the conversion curve occurs when product islands cover most part of the grain surface. The oxygen partial pressure and particle structure have an obvious influence on the duration time of the fast reaction stage. Furthermore, the influence of the external mass transfer and the change of effectiveness factor during the oxidation reaction process were discussed to investigate the controlling step of the reaction. It was concluded that the external mass transfer step hardly affects the reaction performance under the particle sizes normally used in CLOU. The value of the effectiveness factor increases as the reaction goes by, which means the chemical reaction resistance at grain scale increases resulting from the growing number of product islands on the grain surface.",Recent Advances on Metal-Based Near-Infrared and Infrared Emitting OLEDs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974838,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"During the past decades, the development of emissive materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) in infrared region has focused the interest of numerous research groups as these devices can find interest in applications ranging from optical communication to defense.

In this review, an overview of the different metal complexes used in OLEDs and enabling to get an infrared emission is provided.","Characterization of the Chloroplast Genome of Trentepohlia odorata (Trentepohliales, Chlorophyta), and Discussion of its Taxonomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974837,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Trentepohliales is an aerial order of Chlorophyta with approximately 80 species distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The taxonomy of this genus is quite difficult and presents a challenge for many phycologists. Although plentiful molecular data is available, most of the sequences are not identified at the species level. In the present study, we described a new specimen with detailed morphological data and identified it as Trentepohlia odorata. A phylogenetic analysis showed T. odorata as a novel lineage in Trentepohliales. T. odorata has the closest relationship with T. annulata, which is expected since sporangia of both species are without stalk cell and with dorsal pore. Species with such morphological characteristics may represent deep lineages in Trentepohliales. Although an increasing number of chloroplast genomes of Ulvophyceae have been reported in recent years, the whole plastome of Trentepohliales has not yet been reported. Thus, the chloroplast genome of Trentepohlia odorata was reported in the present study. The whole plastome was 399,372 bp in length, with 63 predicted protein-coding genes, 31 tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs. Additionally, we annotated 95 free-standing open reading frames, of which seven were annotated with plastid origins, 16 with eukaryotic genome origins, and 33 with bacterial genome origins. Four rpo genes (rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, and rpoC2) were annotated within ORF clusters. These four genes were fragmented into several (partial) ORFs by in-frame stop codons. Additionally, we detected a frame shift mutation in the rpoB gene. The phylogenetic analysis supported that Trentepohliales clustered with Dasycladales and nested into the BDT clade (Bryopsidales, Dasycladales and Trentepohliales). Our results present the first whole chloroplast genome of a species of Trentepohliales and provided new data for understanding the evolution of the chloroplast genome in Ulvophyceae.",Potential Protective Mechanisms of Ketone Bodies in Migraine Prevention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974836,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"An increasing amount of evidence suggests that migraines are a response to a cerebral energy deficiency or oxidative stress levels that exceed antioxidant capacity. The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet mimicking fasting that leads to the elevation of ketone bodies (KBs), is a therapeutic intervention targeting cerebral metabolism that has recently shown great promise in the prevention of migraines. KBs are an alternative fuel source for the brain, and are thus likely able to circumvent some of the abnormalities in glucose metabolism and transport found in migraines. Recent research has shown that KBs-D-β-hydroxybutyrate in particular-are more than metabolites. As signalling molecules, they have the potential to positively influence other pathways commonly believed to be part of migraine pathophysiology, namely: mitochondrial functioning, oxidative stress, cerebral excitability, inflammation and the gut microbiome. This review will describe the mechanisms by which the presence of KBs, D-BHB in particular, could influence those migraine pathophysiological mechanisms. To this end, common abnormalities in migraines are summarised with a particular focus on clinical data, including phenotypic, biochemical, genetic and therapeutic studies. Experimental animal data will be discussed to elaborate on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of elevated KBs in migraine pathophysiology, with a particular focus on the actions of D-BHB. In complex diseases such as migraines, a therapy that can target multiple possible pathogenic pathways seems advantageous. Further research is needed to establish whether the absence/restriction of dietary carbohydrates, the presence of KBs, or both, are of primary importance for the migraine protective effects of the KD.",Kinase Regulation of HOX Transcription Factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974835,Cancers,2019 06 10,"The HOX genes are a group of homeodomain-containing transcription factors that play important regulatory roles in early development, including the establishment of cell and tissue identity. HOX expression is generally reduced in adult cells but is frequently re-established as an early event in tumour formation and supports an oncogenic phenotype. HOX transcription factors are also involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, along with normal adult physiological process including stem cell renewal. There have been extensive studies on the mechanism by which HOX proteins regulate transcription, with particular emphasis on their interaction with cofactors such as Pre-B-cell Leukaemia Homeobox (PBX) and Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 (MEIS). However, significantly less is known of how the activity of HOX proteins is regulated. There is growing evidence that phosphorylation may play an important role in this context, and in this review, we draw together a number of important studies published over the last 20 years, and discuss the relevance of phosphorylation in the regulation and function of HOX proteins in development, evolution, cell cycle regulation, and cancer."

However, approaches to assessing the risks of the pressure-related aural discomfort have not been reported until recently. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hazards of interior pressure transients of high-speed train on human ears combining the effects of operation speed and seal index. Moving model tests were conducted to obtain the pressure transients when the model train runs in the tunnel. The recorded data were transformed into the interior pressures by empirical formula. Furthermore, the aural sensations were divided into four levels hierarchically and the range for each level was derived by logistic regression analysis method and represented by three biomechanical metrics. Furthermore, a human middle ear finite element (FE) model was used to simulate its dynamics under the interior pressures. The results indicate that lifting operation speed from 250 km/h to 350 km/h in tunnel will prolong the duration of ear complaints by more than two times whereas improving the seal index from 4 s to 12 s will reduce the incidences of the onset of tinnitus and hearing loss by more than ten times. In addition, the duration of aural comfort shortens from the head car to the tail car against the running direction. It is desirable that enhancing the seal index improve the aural sensations of the passengers and crew members considering the lifting operation speed of high-speed train.",Early-Life Exposure to the Chinese Famine and Risk of Cognitive Decline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974821,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Previous studies on the Chinese famine suggested long-term effects of early-life famine exposure on health conditions. This study aims to investigate the association between exposure to the Chinese famine of 1959-1961 at different early-life stages and the risk of cognitive decline in adulthood. A total of 6417 adults born between 1952 and 1964 in the 2015 survey data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study were included in this study. Cognitive performance was estimated through a series of comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS-10), word recall, and pentagon drawing. Multiple generalized linear model (GLM) was employed to detect the association between multi-stage early-life famine exposure and late-life cognitive performance. Compared with the unexposed group, respondents exposed to famine in the fetal period performed worse in the TICS (difference -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.93 to -0.10), word recall (difference -0.46, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.19), and general cognition (difference -1.05, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.47). Furthermore, we also found negative effects of famine exposure on performance of word recall and pentagon drawing in the early (word recall difference -0.56, 95% CI: -1.00 to -0.11; pentagon drawing difference -0.76, 95% CI: -1.40 to -0.12), mid (word recall difference -0.46, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.11; pentagon drawing difference -0.66, 95% CI: -1.16 to -0.16), and late (word recall difference -0.30, 95% CI: -0.55 to -0.04; pentagon drawing difference -0.75, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.37) childhood-exposed groups. Early-life famine exposure in different stages is positively associated with late-life cognitive decline. Fetal famine exposure might affect the overall cognitive status in adulthood, and childhood famine exposure has potential adverse effects on visuospatial episodic memory.",Synthetic Biodegradable Aliphatic Polyester Nanocomposites Reinforced with Nanohydroxyapatite and/or Graphene Oxide for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974820,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This paper provides review updates on the current development of bionanocomposites with polymeric matrices consisting of synthetic biodegradable aliphatic polyesters reinforced with nanohydroxyaptite (nHA) and/or graphene oxide (GO) nanofillers for bone tissue engineering applications. Biodegradable aliphatic polyesters include poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and copolymers of PLA-PGA (PLGA). Those bionanocomposites have been explored for making 3D porous scaffolds for the repair of bone defects since nHA and GO enhance their bioactivity and biocompatibility by promoting biomineralization, bone cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, thus facilitating new bone tissue formation upon implantation. The incorporation of nHA or GO into aliphatic polyester scaffolds also improves their mechanical strength greatly, especially hybrid GO/nHA nanofilllers. Those mechanically strong nanocomposite scaffolds can support and promote cell attachment for tissue growth. Porous scaffolds fabricated from conventional porogen leaching, and thermally induced phase separation have many drawbacks inducing the use of organic solvents, poor control of pore shape and pore interconnectivity, while electrospinning mats exhibit small pores that limit cell infiltration and tissue ingrowth. Recent advancement of 3D additive manufacturing allows the production of aliphatic polyester nanocomposite scaffolds with precisely controlled pore geometries and large pores for the cell attachment, growth, and differentiation in vitro, and the new bone formation in vivo.","Rectal and Vaginal Eradication of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) in Pregnant Women by Using Lactobacillus salivarius CECT 9145, A Target-specific Probiotic Strain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974819,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococci, GBS) can cause severe neonatal sepsis. The recto-vaginal GBS screening of pregnant women and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to positive ones is one of the main preventive options. However, such a strategy has some limitations and there is a need for alternative approaches. Initially, the vaginal microbiota of 30 non-pregnant and 24 pregnant women, including the assessment of GBS colonization, was studied. Among the Lactobacillus isolates, 10 Lactobacillus salivarius strains were selected for further characterization. In vitro characterization revealed that L. salivarius CECT 9145 was the best candidate for GBS eradication. Its efficacy to eradicate GBS from the intestinal and vaginal tracts of pregnant women was evaluated in a pilot trial involving 57 healthy pregnant women. All the volunteers in the probiotic group (n = 25) were GBS-positive and consumed ~9 log10 cfu of L. salivarius CECT 9145 daily from week 26 to week 38. At the end of the trial (week 38), 72% and 68% of the women in this group were GBS-negative in the rectal and vaginal samples, respectively. L. salivarius CECT 9145 seems to be an efficient method to reduce the number of GBS-positive women during pregnancy, decreasing the number of women receiving IAP during delivery.",Can Gossip Buffer the Effect of Job Insecurity on Workplace Friendships?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974818,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Although previous research has documented a host of negative consequences of job insecurity, workplace interpersonal relationships have rarely been considered. This omission might be caused by the application of broad stress theories to the job insecurity literature without taking a nuanced perspective to understand the nature of job insecurity. To address this issue, we conceptualized job insecurity as a threat to employee social acceptance by their employer. This conceptualization, therefore, allows us to apply the multimotive model of social rejection to investigate a previously-overlooked outcome of job insecurity-workplace friendships. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between both job feature insecurity and job loss insecurity with workplace friendships. Based on stress coping theory and the fundamental differences between job feature insecurity and job loss insecurity, we further proposed that employees' tendency to engage in positive gossip buffers the negative impact of job feature insecurity on workplace friendships, whereas employees' tendency to engage in negative gossip buffers the negative impact of job loss insecurity on workplace friendships. Data collected from 286 working adults from Mturk supported our hypotheses. Our study opens the door for future research to take a more nuanced approach when examining nontraditional consequences of job insecurity.",Classification of Hydration in Clinical Conditions: Indirect and Direct Approaches Using Bioimpedance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974817,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Although the need to assess hydration is well recognized, laboratory tests and clinical impressions are impractical and lack sensitivity, respectively, to be clinically meaningful. Different approaches use bioelectrical impedance measurements to overcome some of these limitations and aid in the classification of hydration status. One indirect approach utilizes single or multiple frequency bioimpedance in regression equations and theoretical models, respectively, with anthropometric measurements to predict fluid volumes (bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy-BIS) and estimate fluid overload based on the deviation of calculated to reference extracellular fluid volume. Alternatively, bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) uses direct phase-sensitive measurements of resistance and reactance, measured at 50 kHz, normalized for standing height, then plotted on a bivariate graph, resulting in a vector with length related to fluid content, and direction with phase angle that indexes hydration status. Comparison with healthy population norms enables BIVA to classify (normal, under-, and over-) and rank (change relative to pre-treatment) hydration independent of body weight. Each approach has wide-ranging uses in evaluation and management of clinical groups with over-hydration with an evolving emphasis on prognosis. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of BIS and BIVA for hydration assessment with comments on future applications.",Hierarchical Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974816,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Deep learning models combining spectral and spatial features have been proven to be effective for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, most spatial feature integration methods only consider a single input spatial scale regardless of various shapes and sizes of objects over the image plane, leading to missing scale-dependent information. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with auxiliary classifiers (HMCNN-AC) to learn hierarchical multi-scale spectral-spatial features for HSI classification. First, to better exploit the spatial information, multi-scale image patches for each pixel are generated at different spatial scales. These multi-scale patches are all centered at the same central spectrum but with shrunken spatial scales. Then, we apply multi-scale CNNs to extract spectral-spatial features from each scale patch. The obtained multi-scale convolutional features are considered as structured sequential data with spectral-spatial dependency, and a bidirectional LSTM is proposed to capture the correlation and extract a hierarchical representation for each pixel. To better train the whole network, weighted auxiliary classifiers are employed for the multi-scale CNNs and optimized together with the main loss function. Experimental results on three public HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over some state-of-the-art methods.",Policy and Science for Global Health Security: Shaping the Course of International Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974815,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 12,"The global burden of infectious diseases and the increased attention to natural, accidental, and deliberate biological threats has resulted in significant investment in infectious disease research. Translating the results of these studies to inform prevention, detection, and response efforts often can be challenging, especially if prior relationships and communications have not been established with decision-makers. Whatever scientific information is shared with decision-makers before, during, and after public health emergencies is highly dependent on the individuals or organizations who are communicating with policy-makers. This article briefly describes the landscape of stakeholders involved in information-sharing before and during emergencies. We identify critical gaps in translation of scientific expertise and results, and biosafety and biosecurity measures to public health policy and practice with a focus on One Health and zoonotic diseases. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways of improving communication and funding, both of which help to address the identified gaps.

The expression of sod genes was determined by promoter-xylE transcriptional fusion assay and qRT-PCR. SodA2 and sodB expressions were proportional to the bacterial logarithmic growth, but unaffected by menadione (MD), iron, or manganese challenges. SodA1 was intrinsically unexpressed and inducibly expressed by MD. Complementary expression of sodA1 was observed when sodA2 was inactivated. The individual or combined sod deletion mutants were constructed using the gene replacement strategy. The functions of SODs were assessed by evaluating cell viabilities of different sod mutants in MD, low iron-stressed, and/or low manganese-stressed conditions. Inactivation of SodA1 or SodA2 alone did not affect bacterial viability; however, simultaneously inactivating sodA1 and sodA2 significantly compromised bacterial viability in both aerobic growth and stressed conditions. SodA1 can either rescue or support SodA2 when SodA2 is defective or insufficiently potent. The presence of two MnSODs gives S. maltophilia an advantage against superoxide stress.",Polymyxins: To Combine or Not to Combine?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974813,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 12,"Polymyxins have been a mainstay for the treatment of extensively drug resistant (XDR) Gram-negative bacteria for the past two decades. Many questions regarding the clinical use of polymyxins have been answered, but whether the administration of polymyxins in combination with other antibiotics leads to better outcomes remains unknown. This review discusses the limitations of observational studies that suggest a benefit of combinations of colistin and carbapenems to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), especially Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae, and summarizes the results of randomized controlled trials in which treatment with colistin in combination with meropenem or rifampin does not lead to better clinical outcomes than colisitn monotherapy in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). Although the introduction of new antibiotics makes it possible to treat certain strains of CRE and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) with polymyxin-sparing regimens, the use of polymyxins is, for now, still necessary in CRAB and in CRE and CRPA harboring metallo-beta-lactamases. Therefore, strategies must be developed to optimize polymyxin-based treatments, informed by in vitro hollow fiber models, careful clinical observations, and high-quality evidence from appropriately designed trials."

Meanwhile, thickness-insensitive and environment-friendly water/alcohol soluble processing are two essential requirements for large-scale roll-to-roll commercial application. Based on this, we designed and synthesized two new n-type ETLs with tetraethylene pentamine or butyl sulfonate sodium substituted tetraethylene pentamine as the branched side chains and high electron affinities perylene diimide (PDI) as the central core, named as PDIPN and PDIPNSO₃Na. Encouragingly, both PDIPN and PDIPNSO₃Na can effectively reduce the interfacial barrier and improve the interfacial contact. In addition, both of them can exhibit strong n-type self-doping effects, especially the PDIPN with higher density of negative charge. Consequently, compared to bare ITO, the PCE of the devices with ITO/PDIPN and ITO/PDIPNSO₃Na ETLs has increased to 3-4 times. Our research results indicate that n-type self-doping PDI-based ETL PDIPN and PDIPNSO₃Na could be promising candidates for ETL in environment-friendly water/alcohol soluble processing large-scale PSCs.","Genome-Wide Characterization, Evolution, and Expression Profiling of VQ Gene Family in Response to Phytohormone Treatments and Abiotic Stress in Eucalyptus grandis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974801,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"VQ genes play important roles in plant development, growth, and stress responses. However, little information regarding the functions of VQ genes is available for Eucalyptus grandis. In our study, genome-wide characterization and identification of VQ genes were performed in E. grandis. Results showed that 27 VQ genes, which divided into seven sub-families (I-VII), were found, and all but two VQ genes showed no intron by gene structure and conserved motif analysis. To further identify the function of EgrVQ proteins, gene expression analyses were also developed under hormone treatments (brassinosteroids, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid) and abiotic conditions (salt stress, cold 4 °C, and heat 42 °C). The results of a quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the EgrVQs were variously expressed under different hormone treatments and abiotic stressors. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of VQ genes in E. grandis, which will be beneficial in the molecular breeding of E. grandis to promote its resistance to abiotic stressors; the results also provide a basis from which to conduct further investigation into the functions of VQ genes in E. grandis.",Enzymatic Weight Update Algorithm for DNA-Based Molecular Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974800,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Recent research in DNA nanotechnology has demonstrated that biological substrates can be used for computing at a molecular level. However, in vitro demonstrations of DNA computations use preprogrammed, rule-based methods which lack the adaptability that may be essential in developing molecular systems that function in dynamic environments. Here, we introduce an in vitro molecular algorithm that 'learns' molecular models from training data, opening the possibility of 'machine learning' in wet molecular systems. Our algorithm enables enzymatic weight update by targeting internal loop structures in DNA and ensemble learning, based on the hypernetwork model. This novel approach allows massively parallel processing of DNA with enzymes for specific structural selection for learning in an iterative manner. We also introduce an intuitive method of DNA data construction to dramatically reduce the number of unique DNA sequences needed to cover the large search space of feature sets. By combining molecular computing and machine learning the proposed algorithm makes a step closer to developing molecular computing technologies for future access to more intelligent molecular systems.",The Thermal Effects of Water Immersion on Health Outcomes: An Integrative Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974799,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Hydrotherapy is widely used for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients, but it can also be applied to prevent diseases in healthy people. This review investigates the health effects of water immersion, a form of hydrotherapy, and the mechanisms by which the properties of water elicit such an effect. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. Various factors of water immersion were investigated in the 13 selected articles, including water temperature, immersion height, and application area. With respect to health effects, warm and cold water immersion affects the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems, respectively. Nine articles focused on the effects of warm water immersion, explaining its thermal effect in relation to changes in disease-related serum substance levels and hemodynamic changes. While the sample population in most studies comprised young adults, two articles applied partial water immersion to the legs of elderly subjects to assess its effect on sleep. Because the water immersion protocols applied in the 13 articles were inconsistent, the health benefits could not be clearly explained. However, we expect the present findings to be beneficial for providing research guidelines for studies on the application of water immersion.",Gastric Microbiota in Helicobacter pylori-Negative and -Positive Gastritis Among High Incidence of Gastric Cancer Area.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974798,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) related chronic gastritis is a well-known major etiological factor for gastric cancer development. However, H. pylori-negative gastritis (HpN) is not well described. We aimed to examine gastric mucosal microbiota in HpN compared to H. pylori-positive gastritis (HpP) and H. pylori-negative non-gastritis group (control). Here, we studied 11 subjects with HpN, 40 with HpP and 24 controls. We performed endoscopy with six gastric biopsies. Comparison groups were defined based on strict histological criteria for the disease and H. pylori diagnosis. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to profile the gastric microbiota according to comparison groups. These results demonstrate that the HpP group had significantly lower bacterial richness by the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts, and Shannon and Simpson indices as compared to HpN or controls. The linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis showed the enrichment of Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria at phylum level in the HpN group. In the age-adjusted multivariate analysis, Streptococcus sp. and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were at a significantly increased risk for HpN (odds ratio 18.9 and 12.3, respectively) based on abundance. Treponema sp. was uniquely found in HpN based on occurrence. In this paper, we conclude that Streptococcus sp., Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Treponema sp. are candidate pathogenic bacterial species for HpN. These results if confirmed may have important clinical implications.","Novel Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Techniques for DNA, Protein and Drug Detection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974797,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a vibrational spectroscopic technique in which the Raman scattering signal strength of molecules, absorbed by rough metals or the surface of nanoparticles, experiences an exponential growth (10³-10⁶ times and even 1014-1015 times) because of electromagnetic or chemical enhancements. Nowadays, SERS has attracted tremendous attention in the field of analytical chemistry due to its specific advantages, including high selectivity, rich informative spectral properties, nondestructive testing, and the prominent multiplexing capabilities of Raman spectroscopy. In this review, we present the applications of state-of-the-art SERS for the detection of DNA, proteins and drugs.

Herein, an electrospinning technique was used to produce new asymmetric membranes. The protective layer was composed of a blending solution between polycaprolactone and polylactic acid, whereas the underlying layer was comprised of methacrylated gelatin and chitosan. The chemical/physical properties, the in vitro hemo- and biocompatibility of the nanofibrous membranes were evaluated. The results obtained reveal that the produced membranes exhibited a wettability able to provide a moist environment at wound site. Moreover, the membranes' hemocompatibility and fibroblast cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation at the surface of the membranes were also noticed in the in vitro assays. Such results highlight the suitability of these asymmetric membranes for wound dressing applications.",Expression and Activity of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in the Intervertebral Disc: Association with Inflammation and Matrix Remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974795,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have emerged as potential sensors and transducers of inflammatory pain. The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the expression of TRP channels in intervertebral disc (IVD) cells in normal and inflammatory conditions and (2) the function of Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in IVD inflammation and matrix homeostasis. RT-qPCR was used to analyze human fetal, healthy, and degenerated IVD tissues for the gene expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1. The primary IVD cell cultures were stimulated with either interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) alone or in combination with TRPA1/V1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, 3 and 10 µM), followed by analysis of calcium flux and the expression of inflammation mediators (RT-qPCR/ELISA) and matrix constituents (RT-qPCR). The matrix structure and composition in caudal motion segments from TRPA1 and TRPV1 wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice was visualized by FAST staining. Gene expression of other TRP channels (A1, C1, C3, C6, V1, V2, V4, V6, M2, M7, M8) was also tested in cytokine-treated cells. TRPA1 was expressed in fetal IVD cells, 20% of degenerated IVDs, but not in healthy mature IVDs. TRPA1 expression was not detectable in untreated cells and it increased upon cytokine treatment, while TRPV1 was expressed and concomitantly reduced. In inflamed IVD cells, 10 µM AITC activated calcium flux, induced gene expression of IL-8, and reduced disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) and collagen 1A1, possibly via upregulated TRPA1. TRPA1 KO in mice was associated with signs of degeneration in the nucleus pulposus and the vertebral growth plate, whereas TRPV1 KO did not show profound changes. Cytokine treatment also affected the gene expression of TRPV2 (increase), TRPV4 (increase), and TRPC6 (decrease). TRPA1 might be expressed in developing IVD, downregulated during its maturation, and upregulated again in degenerative disc disease, participating in matrix homeostasis. However, follow-up studies with larger sample sizes are needed to fully elucidate the role of TRPA1 and other TRP channels in degenerative disc disease.",A Microfluidic Chip Embracing a Nanofiber Scaffold for 3D Cell Culture and Real-Time Monitoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974794,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Recently, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture and tissue-on-a-chip application have attracted attention because of increasing demand from the industries and their potential to replace conventional two-dimensional culture and animal tests.

A electrospun nanofiber scaffold can provide 3D cell culture conditions to a microfluidic chip environment, and its perfusion method in the chip can allow real-time monitoring of cell status based on the conditioned culture medium. To justify the applicability of the developed chip to 3D cell culture and real-time monitoring, HepG2 cells were cultured in the chip for 14 days.

The variation of the SMFL signal of the steel bar with the tensile force indicates that the curve of the SMFL signal has a significant extreme point when the tensile force reaches about 65% of the yield tension, of which the first derivative curve has extreme points in the elastic and yielding stages, respectively. To study the variation of SMFL signal with the axial position of the steel bar under different tensile forces, a parameter reflecting the fluctuation of the SMFL signal along the steel bar is proposed. The linear relationship between this parameter and the tensile force can be used to quantitatively calculate the tensile force of steel bar. The method in this paper provides significant application prospects for the internal force detection of steel bar in the actual engineering."

The common advantages of I-FOGs with closed-loop compensation are linearized output characteristics and insensitivity to the light source power, including its time and thermal-induced fluctuations. Whereas closed-loop operation is normally achieved via ramp modulation requiring an electro-optic modulator, all-fiber architectures with a piezoelectric modulator are mostly limited to open loop. Nevertheless, such setups can more conveniently utilize a less expensive single-mode fiber with depolarized light and do not require any custom-made components. The proposed method allows us to combine the advantages of both approaches. Closed-loop compensation is ensured by adding further sinusoidal modulation to the common biasing modulation, such that the Sagnac phase shift is compensated solely at the sampling instants. We describe and experimentally demonstrate the proposed approach, utilizing a test setup to compare our closed-loop solution with open-loop operation. The results denote that the method provides a cost-efficient manner of performance improvement compared to the open-loop I-FOGs based on a piezoelectric modulator.",Technology to Support Aging in Place: Older Adults' Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974780,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 12,"The U.S. population over 65 years of age is increasing. Most older adults prefer to age in place, and technologies, including Internet of things (IoT), Ambient/Active Assisted Living (AAL) robots and other artificial intelligence (AI), can support independent living. However, a top-down design process creates mismatches between technologies and older adults' needs. A user-centered design approach was used to identify older adults' perspectives regarding AAL and AI technologies and gauge interest in participating in a co-design process. A survey was used to obtain demographic characteristics and assess privacy perspectives. A convenience sample of 31 retirement community residents participated in one of two 90-min focus group sessions. The semi-structured group interview solicited barriers and facilitators to technology adoption, privacy attitudes, and interest in project co-design participation to inform technology development. Focus group sessions were audiotaped and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were reviewed and coded to identify themes and patterns. Descriptive statistics were applied to the quantitative data. Identified barriers to technology use included low technology literacy, including lack of familiarity with terminology, and physical challenges, which can make adoption difficult. Facilitators included an eagerness to learn, interest in co-design, and a desire to understand and control their data. Most participants identified as privacy pragmatics and fundamentalists, indicating that privacy is important to older adults. At the same time, they also reported a willingness to contribute to the design of technologies that would facilitate aging independently. There is a need to increase technology literacy of older adults along with aging literacy of technologists.",Performance Investigation on Different Designs of Superhydrophobic Surface Texture for Composite Insulator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974779,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"To investigate the superhydrophobic properties of different surface textures, nine designs of textures with micro-nanostructures were produced successfully using the laser engraving technique on the surfaces of composite insulator umbrella skirt samples made of silicon rubber. The optimal parameters of the texture designs to give rise to the best hydrophobicity were determined. The surface morphology, abrasion resistance, corrosion resistance, self-cleaning and antifouling property of the different textured surfaces as well as water droplets rolling on the textured surfaces were studied experimentally using a contact angle meter, scanning electron microscope, three-dimensional topography meter and high-speed camera system. It was found that the diamond column design with optimal parameters has the best superhydrophobicity and overall performance. The most remarkable advantage of the optimal diamond column design is its robustness and long-term superhydrophobicity after repeated de-icing in harsh conditions.

The diversity and unequal geographical prevalence of rotavirus genotypes have been linked to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in different human populations. In order to evaluate the role of HBGAs in rotavirus infections in our population, secretor status (FUT2+), ABO blood group, and Lewis antigens were determined in children attended for rotavirus gastroenteritis in Valencia, Spain. During three consecutive years (2013-2015), stool and saliva samples were collected from 133 children with rotavirus infection. Infecting viral genotypes and HBGAs were determined in patients and compared to a control group and data from blood donors. Rotavirus G9P[8] was the most prevalent strain (49.6%), followed by G1P[8] (20.3%) and G12P[8] (14.3%). Rotavirus infected predominantly secretor (99%) and Lewis b positive (91.7%) children. Children with blood group A and AB were significantly more prone to rotavirus gastroenteritis than those with blood group O. Our results confirm that a HBGA genetic background is linked to rotavirus P[8] susceptibility. Rotavirus P[8] symptomatic infection is manifestly more frequent in secretor-positive (FUT2+) than in non-secretor individuals, although no differences between rotavirus G genotypes were found.",Forms of Damage of Bricks Subjected to Cyclic Freezing and Thawing in Actual Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974775,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The paper presents the characteristics of damage of bricks in masonry structures of significant historical value as a result of cyclic freezing and thawing. Based on extensive investigation, which included macroscopic description, determination of compressive strength and tensile strength, determination of the mineral composition, scanning microscopy observation and determination of the porosity structure of bricks, three forms of frost damage were distinguished, termed as powdering, flaking and cracking. Bricks were collected from existing historical buildings 70 years after their construction. It was observed that the particular form of frost damage of bricks is highly correlated with the structure of porosity. Additional factors affecting the form of frost destruction are the strength of the material, its mineral composition and the spatial arrangement of the texture elements. Taking the above into account, it is possible to evaluate frost resistance of bricks and specify the form of damage. Predicting frost resistance and forms of damage based on low-destructive methods using small samples is the expected solution in the case of heritage facilities.",Single-Image Depth Inference Using Generative Adversarial Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974774,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Depth has been a valuable piece of information for perception tasks such as robot grasping, obstacle avoidance, and navigation, which are essential tasks for developing smart homes and smart cities. However, not all applications have the luxury of using depth sensors or multiple cameras to obtain depth information. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several depth estimation works.",Long Term Outcomes and Effects of Surgery on Degenerative Spinal Deformity: A 14-Year National Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974773,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Degenerative spinal deformity (DSD) has become a prevalent cause of disability and pain among the aging population worldwide. Though surgery has emerged as a promising option for DSD, the natural course, outcomes, and effects of surgery on DSD have remained elusive. This cohort study used a national database to comprehensively follow up patients of DSD for all-cause mortality, respiratory problems, and hip fracture-related hospitalizations. All patients were grouped into an operation or a non-operation group for comparison. An adjustment of demographics, comorbidities, and propensity-score matching was conducted to ameliorate confounders. A Cox regression hazard ratio (HR) model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were also applied. The study comprised 21,810 DSD patients, including 12,544 of the operation group and 9266 of the non-operation group. During the 14 years (total 109,591.2 person-years) of follow-up, the operation group had lower mortality (crude hazard ratio = 0.40), lower respiratory problems (cHR = 0.45), and lower hip fractures (cHR = 0.63) than the non-operation group (all p < 0.001). After adjustment, the risks for mortality and respiratory problems remained lower (adjusted HR = 0.60 and 0.65, both p < 0.001) in the operation than the non-operation group, while hip fractures were indifferent (aHR = 1.08, p > 0.05). Therefore, surgery for DSD is invaluable since it could reduce the risks of mortality and of hospitalization for respiratory problems.",Effects of Palm Oil Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction (TRF) and Carotenes in Ovalbumin (OVA)-Challenged Asthmatic Brown Norway Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974772,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Synthetic therapeutic drugs for asthma, a chronic airway inflammation characterised by strong eosinophil, mast cell, and lymphocyte infiltration, mucus hyper-production, and airway hyper-responsiveness, exhibit numerous side effects.

Here, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of TRF, carotene, and dexamethasone in ovalbumin-challenged allergic asthma in Brown Norway rats. Asthmatic symptoms fully developed within 8 days after the second sensitization, and were preserved throughout the time course via intranasal ovalbumin re-challenge. Asthmatic rats were then orally administered 30 mg/kg body weight TRF or carotene. TRF-treated animals exhibited reduced inflammatory cells in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. TRF- and carotene-treated rats exhibited notable white blood cell reduction comparable to that from dexamethasone. TRF- and carotene-treatment also downregulated pro-inflammatory markers (IL-β, IL-6, TNF-α), coincident with anti-inflammatory marker IL-4 and IL-13 upregulation. Treatment significantly reduced asthmatic rat plasma CRP and IgE, signifying improved systemic inflammation. Asthmatic lung histology displayed severe edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in the bronchial wall, whereas treated animals retained healthy, normal-appearing lungs. The phytonutrients tocotrienol and carotene thus exhibit potential benefits for consumption as nutritional adjuncts in asthmatic disease."

ERF/AP2 transcription factors are a major group of proteins that are often involved in regulating stress-responses and developmental programs. Some ERF/AP2 proteins are targets of CULLIN3-based E3 ligases that use BTB/POZ-MATH proteins as substrate receptors. These receptors bind the transcription factor and facilitate their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome. Here, we show tissue and stress-dependent expression patterns for three Brassica rapa ERF/AP2 proteins that are closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana AtRAP2.4. Cloning of the Brassica genes showed that the corresponding proteins can assemble with a BPM protein and CULLIN3, and that they are instable in a 26S proteasome dependent manner. This work demonstrates the conserved nature of the ERF/AP2-CULLIN3-based E3 ligase interplay, and represents a first step to analyze their function in a commercially relevant crop plant.",Bacterial Resistance in Pneumonia in Developing Countries-A Role for Iron Chelation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974759,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 12,"Pneumonia represents one of the major infectious diseases in developing countries and is associated with high mortality, in particular in children under the age of five. The main causative bacterial agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B, accounting for 33% and 16%, respectively, of the mortality in under-fives. Iron modulates the immune response in infectious diseases and increased iron levels can lead to complications such as sepsis and multiorgan failure. This review will look into the use of iron chelators in order to reduce microbial growth and attenuate a dysregulated immune response during infection. Our hypothesis is that temporary restriction of iron will lessen the incidence and complication rate of infections like pneumonia and result in a decrease of mortality and morbidity.",Family Functioning and Psychological Health of Children with Mentally Ill Parents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974758,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Parental mental illness can be linked to reduced family functioning, which is associated with more conflicts, less adaptability and cohesion as well as a disorganized pattern of everyday planning. Concurrently, family functioning is an important moderator for the influence of parental mental disorders on the development of the children. Consequently, the current study addresses the correlation of family functioning in families with mentally ill parents and the psychological health of the children. The sample consists of 67 mentally ill parents. Both parents and therapists completed questionnaires related to family functioning and the psychological health of the children. Family functioning was rated as dysfunctional in 38% of the families. The psychological health of the children was classified as clinical or subclinical in 43% of the cases. 52% of the children were rated to have no psychological problems. In families with good family functioning, children were assessed to have less psychological problems than in families with poor functioning. Children outside the clinical range lived in families with good family functioning and vice versa. Significant positive correlations were found between the FB-A scales, the CBCL/4-18 syndrome scales and the CBCL/4-18 total score. Results indicate that family functioning and psychological health of children in families with mentally ill parents correlate closely and represent potential targets for future family interventions.",3D Printed Sensors for Biomedical Applications: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974757,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"This paper showcases a substantial review on some of the significant work done on 3D printing of sensors for biomedical applications.

Across the literature there is an absence of device version reporting and a failure to recognize that device validity is not maintained when firmware and software updates can, and do, change device performance and parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose the use of tractable methods to assess devices at their current version and provide an example empirical approach. Experimental results for heart rate and step count acquisitions during walking and everyday living activities from Garmin Vivosmart 3 (v4.10) wristband monitors are presented and analyzed, and the reliability issues of optically-acquired heart rates, especially during periods of activity, are demonstrated and discussed.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in three greater Jakarta neighborhoods where informal ULAB recycling occurs. Venous BLLs among 279 children were analyzed using portable blood lead testing machines. Demographic, child activities, and sources of lead exposure inside and outside homes were assessed. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with the prevalence of BLLs. Forty-seven percent of children had BLLs ≥ 5 µg/dL and 9% had BLLs ≥ 10 µg/dL.

APC also modulates cellular homeostasis by exhibiting potent cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory signaling activities. The beneficial cytoprotective effects of APC have been extensively studied and confirmed in a number of preclinical disease and injury models including sepsis, type-1 diabetes and various ischemia/reperfusion diseases. It is now well-known that APC modulates downstream cell signaling networks and transcriptome profiles when it binds to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) to activate protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) on various cell types. However, despite much progress, details of the downstream signaling mechanism of APC and its crosstalk with other signaling networks are far from being fully understood. In this review, we focus on the cardioprotective properties of APC in ischemic heart disease and heart failure with a special emphasis on recent discoveries related to the modulatory effect of APC on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), PI3K/AKT, and mTORC1 signaling pathways. The cytoprotective properties of APC might provide a novel strategy for future therapies in cardiac diseases."

Under further stress, the crack propagates and leads to severe structural damage. To avoid such damage, the identification of the crack tips, and monitoring of the surrounding stress and strain fields, are very important. In this work, the location of, and strain distribution monitoring around, the crack tip are achieved using a dense ultra-short (DUS) fiber Bragg grating (FBG) array together with an improved optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) interrogator. The adjacent grating interference correlation algorithm helps overcome the limitation on the demodulation precision, which is imposed by the inherently broad reflection spectra of individual ultra-short gratings. High spatial resolution measurement of the strain profile around the crack tip is performed at different levels of induced strain. Furthermore, the vertical-crossed layout is adopted to avoid the omission of cracks, which usually occurs in the case of the one direction layout. We achieve 1 mm spatial resolution and 7.5 m detection distance. Location of a single crack, multiple cracks, and an oblique crack was realized experimentally by locating the crack tips. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analysis, verifying the feasibility of the DUS-FBG system for high-density distributed crack tip sensing.",Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase STK16.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974739,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"STK16 (Ser/Thr kinase 16, also known as Krct/PKL12/MPSK1/TSF-1) is a myristoylated and palmitoylated Ser/Thr protein kinase that is ubiquitously expressed and conserved among all eukaryotes.

Accumulating evidence suggests a significant association of increased MAOA expression and advanced high-grade prostate cancer (PCa) progression and metastasis. Herein, a series of novel conjugates combining the MAOA inhibitor isoniazid (INH) and tumor-targeting near-infrared (NIR) heptamethine cyanine dyes were designed and synthesized. The synthesized compounds G1⁻G13 were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells using the MTT assay, and molecular docking studies were performed. Results showed that most tested compounds exhibited improved antitumor efficacy compared with INH. Moreover, conjugates G10 and G11 showed potent anticancer activity with IC50 values (0.85 and 0.4 μM respectively) comparable to that of doxorubicin (DOX). This may be attributable to the preferential accumulation of these conjugates in tumor cells. G10, G11, and G12 also demonstrated moderate MAOA inhibitory activities. This result and the results of molecular docking studies were consistent with their cytotoxicity activities. Taken together, these data suggest that a combination of the MAOA inhibitor INH with tumor-targeting heptamethine cyanine dyes may prove to be a highly promising tool for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.",Traffic Light Recognition Based on Binary Semantic Segmentation Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974735,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"A traffic light recognition system is a very important building block in an advanced driving assistance system and an autonomous vehicle system. In this paper, we propose a two-staged deep-learning-based traffic light recognition method that consists of a pixel-wise semantic segmentation technique and a novel fully convolutional network. For candidate detection, we employ a binary-semantic segmentation network that is suitable for detecting small objects such as traffic lights. Connected components labeling with an eight-connected neighborhood is applied to obtain bounding boxes of candidate regions, instead of the computationally demanding region proposal and regression processes of conventional methods. A fully convolutional network including a convolution layer with three filters of (1 × 1) at the beginning is designed and implemented for traffic light classification, as traffic lights have only a set number of colors. The simulation results show that the proposed traffic light recognition method outperforms the conventional two-staged object detection method in terms of recognition performance, and remarkably reduces the computational complexity and hardware requirements. This framework can be a useful network design guideline for the detection and recognition of small objects, including traffic lights.",The Effect of Cation Disorder on Ferroelectric Properties of SrxBa1-xNb₂O₆ Tungsten Bronzes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974734,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The versatile crystal structure of tetragonal tungsten bronzes (A1₂A2₄C₄B10O30) can accommodate complex stoichiometries including cations in different valence states and vacant cation sites.

SBNX (x = 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.61) ceramics, prepared by conventional solid-state synthesis, were annealed at varying temperatures and subsequently quenched to room temperature. The Curie temperature of all the SBNX materials increased with higher quenching temperatures, accompanied with ferroelectric hardening. The variation in thermal history also caused structural changes, specifically a contraction of the a lattice parameter and a minor elongation of the c parameter. These effects are discussed in relation to recent first principles calculations of the energy landscape of the cation-vacancy configurations and experimental evidence of thermally induced cation-vacancy disordering.","The Laser Vegetation Detecting Sensor: A Full Waveform, Large-Footprint, Airborne Laser Altimeter for Monitoring Forest Resources.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974733,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The use of satellite-borne large-footprint LiDAR (light detection and ranging) systems allows for the acquisition of forest monitoring data.

Data from LVDS were used to calculate the mean height of forest trees on sample plots using data collected in the Hunan province of China. The results show that the full waveform data obtained by LVDS has the ability to accurately characterize forest height. The mean absolute percentage error of mean forest height per plot in flat areas was 6.8%, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.78 m. The airborne LVDS system provides prototype data sets and a platform for instrument proof-of-concept studies for China's Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Monitoring (TECM) mission, which is an Earth remote sensing satellite due for launch in 2020.

It consists of a substrate with a curved channel and a hollow waveguide. The hollow waveguide is curved into the channel and works as a gas absorption cell as well as a transmission medium for mid-infrared light. Owing to the low loss property of the hollow waveguide, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was improved for the sensing system. A polycarbonate (PC) base tube was used to obtain flexibility in the fabrication of the hollow waveguide. A silver (Ag) layer and a silver iodide (AgI) layer were inner-coated to ensure a low loss property at the fingerprint wavelength of methane gas. A sensing system was established using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), an external detector, and an eHWG. Experimental investigations were carried on the sensing performance of eHWGs with various channel shapes. Comparison studies were made on eHWGs embedded with Ag-coated or Ag- and AgI-coated hollow waveguides. The Ag- and AgI-coated hollow waveguides with inner diameters of 0.7, 1.4, and 2.0 mm were used in the eHWGs. The large bore waveguide had low loss but high bending additional loss. The large bore waveguide had a low detection limit due to high coupling efficiency with the light source.

In this case study, Process Mining is used to determine which activities, sub-processes, interactions, and characteristics of episodes explain why some episodes have a longer duration. The employed method and the results obtained are described in detail to serve as a guide for future performance analysis in this domain. It was discovered that the main cause of the increment in the episode duration is the occurrence of a loop between the Examination and Treatment sub-processes. It was also found out that as the episode severity increases, the number of repetitions of the Examination-Treatment loop increases as well. Moreover, the episodes in which this loop is more common are those that lead to Hospitalization as discharge destination. These findings might help to reduce the occurrence of this loop, in turn lowering the episode duration and, consequently, providing faster attention to more patients.",Cherry Extract from Prunus avium L. to Improve the Resistance of Endothelial Cells to Oxidative Stress: Mucoadhesive Chitosan vs. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30974730,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Polyphenolic compounds contained in cherry extract (CE) are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Unfortunately, most of these natural compounds have low oral bioavailability, reducing their widespread use. Here, different concentrations of polyphenol-rich CE from Tuscany (Italy), encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), were compared with those encapsulated in two NP types, different from each other in terms of mucoadhesivity, obtained with chitosan derivatives (Ch-der), regarding CE gastrointestinal (GI) permeability and protective effect on oxidative stress. Different NP systems were physico-chemically characterized, and the antioxidant GI permeability was evaluated in a triple-cell co-culture model (Caco-2/HT29-MTX/Raji B), resembling the intestine. PLGA NPs efficiently entrapped CE (up to 840 µg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/mL) without altering size (210 nm), polydispersity index (0.05), or zeta potential (-10.7 mV). Such NPs promoted permeation of encapsulated CE at a CE polyphenolic concentration of at least 2 µg GAE/mL. More mucoadhesive NPs from Ch-der, coded quaternary ammonium S-protected thiolated chitosan (QA-Ch-S-pro) NP, promoted CE GI permeation of 0.5 µg GAE/mL. At higher concentrations of Ch-der polymers, the resulting NPs containing CE were toxic toward Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells. CE protected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from oxidative stress and maintained its activity when entrapped in PLGA NPs. CE encapsulated in QA-Ch-S-pro NP protected HUVECs from oxidative stress, even more effectively than non-encapsulated CE. Furthermore, mucoadhesive NPs from Ch-der were more effective antioxidant protectors than PLGA NPs, but less cytotoxic PLGA NPs could be more useful when comparatively high therapeutic antioxidant doses are needed."
