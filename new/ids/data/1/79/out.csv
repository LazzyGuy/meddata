The main characteristics are generalized exanthema and a monoclonal gammopathy with IgM. Other clinical features include fever, muscle, bone and/or joint pain, and lymphadenopathy. About 15-20% of patients with Schnitzler syndrome develop lymphoproliferative diseases and, in rare cases, amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis can occur if the disease is not treated. Activation of the innate immune system, especially interleukin(IL)-1β, is central in the pathogenesis of the disease. Consequently, complete control of disease symptoms can be achieved in 80% of patients by treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.",Water supplementation after dehydration improves judgment and decision-making performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666412,Psychological research,2019 01 22,"Previous research has shown that dehydration and water supplementation affect mood and cognitive performance in both adults and children on a variety of tasks that assess memory, attention, executive function, and speeded responses. Given the varied effects of water on cognition, this study explored potential effects of water supplementation, hydration status, and thirst on thinking and decision-making tasks. 29 adult participants undertook a battery of cognitive tests on two separate occasions after having fasted from the previous night. On one occasion, they were offered 500 ml of water to drink prior to testing. Measures of urine osmolality confirmed the group-level effectiveness of the dehydration manipulation. Water supplementation was found to improve performance on tasks measuring cognitive reflection in judgement and decision-making. This increase in performance was associated with differences in tasks implicated in inhibition processes. Drinking water after a 12-h dehydration period increased performance in judgement and decision-making tasks, and this was not explained by differences in subjective thirst or attentiveness.",Effects of a highly intensive clean and jerk exercise on blood pressure and arterial stiffness in experienced non-professional weight lifters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666411,European journal of applied physiology,2019 03 29,"Weight lifting training has gained much popularity in recent years and is frequently used in non-professional and professional settings.

Schott (Lamiaceae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666408,Planta,2019 05 13,"In vitro culture conditions and kinetin induced quantitative modifications in the production of the major volatile constituents in Micromeria croatica plantlets. Antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts obtained from micropropagated and wild-growing plants was evaluated. Micromeria spp. are aromatic plants, many of which were shown to exhibit various biological effects. The present study aimed to determine the content and the composition of the essential oil of in vitro-cultured Micromeria croatica (Pers.) Schott and to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of its methanolic extract, in order to compare its phytochemical profile and biological activity with wild-growing plants. Shoots regenerated on MS medium without plant growth regulators (PGRs) or supplemented with kinetin were used for phytochemical analysis. Essential oils from both native plant material and in vitro-cultivated M. croatica plants, with a total of 44 identified constituents, were dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes. Borneol was the main component detected in wild-growing plants (25.28%) and micropropagated plants grown on PGR-free medium (20.30%). Kinetin treatment led to increased oil yield and favored the production of oxygenated monoterpenes, dominated by geranial (33.53%) and cis-p-mentha-1(7),8-dien-ol (23.69%). The percentage of total sesquiterpenoids in micropropagated plant material was considerably lower than in wild-growing plants. In vitro culture conditions and PGRs affected the production of essential oils, inducing quantitative modifications in the production of the major volatile constituents in M. croatica plantlets. The antimicrobial activity of M. croatica methanolic extracts was investigated using the broth microdilution method. Extracts obtained from in vitro cultures generally exhibited greater antibacterial potential, compared to wild-growing plants. Among six bacterial strains tested, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were the most sensitive microorganisms. The present study provided evidence that in vitro culture conditions might favorably affect the antimicrobial activity of M. croatica methanolic extracts.","Epidemiological screening and xenomonitoring for human lymphatic filariasis infection in select districts in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666407,Parasitology research,2019 04 16,"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-transmitted tropical neglected parasitic infection that currently affects over 120 million people around the world and another 856 million people are at risk of acquiring the infection. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) spearheaded by the World Health Organization is the only current strategy to control this infection in endemic areas. In this study, we performed an epidemiological survey in select regions in the southern parts of India to determine the current status of LF infection in subjects. Night blood samples were collected from 916 subjects after proper consent and were screened for the presence of circulating microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti in their peripheral blood. Our results showed the presence of 51 (5.56%) cases of human LF infection in the surveyed areas including new cases for LF, which were not recorded previously. Given the presence of new cases of LF infections, we trapped mosquitoes from these regions and screened for the presence of W. bancrofti L3 specific Ssp1 DNA repeat sequences by PCR. Our results confirmed the presence of LF infection in the mosquitoes collected from six out of nine districts that we surveyed. These findings confirm active transmission of LF infection in all of the areas that we surveyed, despite several years of MDA treatment. The findings in this study suggest potential reemergence of LF infection in most of the areas we surveyed and warrants for a more stringent strategy for controlling LF in these endemic areas.","Preoperative T staging of colon cancer using CT colonography with multiplanar reconstruction: new diagnostic criteria based on ""bordering vessels"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666406,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 04 17,"Preoperative T staging of colon cancer, in particular, for distinguishing T3 from T2 and T4, has been a challenge.

Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 26,"We review and propose easily implemented and affordable indicators to assess the genetic diversity and the potential of a breeding population and propose solutions for its long-term management. Successful plant breeding programs rely on balanced efforts between short-term goals to develop competitive cultivars and long-term goals to improve and maintain diversity in the genetic pool. Indicators of the sustainability of response to selection in breeding pools are of key importance in this context. We reviewed and proposed sets of indicators based on temporal phenotypic and genotypic data and applied them on an early maize grain program implying two breeding pools (Dent and Flint) selected in a reciprocal manner. Both breeding populations showed a significant positive genetic gain summing up to 1.43 qx/ha/year but contrasted evolutions of genetic variance. Advances in high-throughput genotyping permitted the identification of regions of low diversity, mainly localized in pericentromeric regions. Observed changes in genetic diversity were multiple, reflecting a complex breeding system. We estimated the impact of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and of allelic diversity on the additive genetic variance at a genome-wide and chromosome-wide scale. Consistently with theoretical expectation under directional selection, we found a negative contribution of LD to genetic variance, which was unevenly distributed between chromosomes. This suggests different chromosome selection histories and underlines the interest to recombine specific chromosome regions. All three sets of indicators valorize in house data and are easy to implement in the era of genomic selection in every breeding program.",B-cell peripheral neurolymphomatosis: MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666391,Skeletal radiology,2019 06 10,To examine the MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging characteristics of peripheral neurolymphomatosis.,Characterization of glenoid bone remodeling in professional baseball pitchers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666390,Skeletal radiology,2019 06 10,"To characterize the appearance, location, severity, and prevalence of focal glenoid retroversion on shoulder MRI in professional baseball pitchers versus age-matched controls.",Occurence and Prioritization of Pharmaceutical Active Compounds in Domestic/Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666389,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 04 05,"In this study, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were analyzed in the influent and effluent of a domestic wastewater treatment plant in Turkey and a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany and the toxicity of these wastewaters were estimated using a toxic unit (TU) approach. A total of 21 and 32 PhACs were detected in the domestic wastewater and the municipal wastewater, respectively. The TUs estimated for PhACs in municipal wastewater were higher than the TUs estimated for PhACs present in domestic wastewater. The levels of the anti-anxiety drug, oxazepam were estimated to be in the high risk category (HQ > 10) in both wastewaters. In bench-scale tests with ozonation, the removals of four PhACs in the municipal wastewater were investigated. At a dose of 2 mg/L ozone, 97%-98% of diclofenac and carbamazepine were removed.

Both the length and width of elytra and pronotum were compared. Females of all species from the polluted area were smaller than those from the control site with the average difference of 2.7% (range 0.7%-6%). In contrast, males responded less consistently among species: A. stercorosus showed lower size of elytra and pronotum at the polluted area, while in C. arcensis only the elytra length and pronotum width were smaller. C. violaceus males exhibited smaller elytra length and pronotum length and width at the polluted area. In contrast, no differences between the two sites were found for S. capitatum males. Sex differences may originate from different energy investment strategies in females and males related to the reproduction needs. Even if the observed differences in body size were small, the smaller body size in females of all studied species, irrespectively of the guild, is striking and may indicate on lower fitness of a range of species inhabiting metal polluted areas.",Effects of Silicon Application on Uptake of Arsenic and Phosphorus and Formation of Iron Plaque in Rice Seedlings Grown in an Arsenic-Contaminated Soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666387,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 01 22,"Silicon (Si) plays important roles in improving rice growth and mitigating rice arsenic (As) uptake. In the present study, a pot experiment was carried out to investigate effects of Si application on uptake of As and phosphorus (P) and formation of iron (Fe) plaque on root surface of two rice cultivars (Zhendao 10 and Nanjing 44) grown in a high As-contaminated soil. The results showed that dry weights of shoots and roots for both rice cultivars didn't significantly varied under low Si level, but significantly increased for Zhendao 10, while decreased for Nanjing 44 under high Si level (p < 0.05). As concentrations in shoots and roots of Nanjing 44 significantly decreased for low Si level, while significantly increased for high Si level (p < 0.05). Different from Nanjing 44, effect of Si application on As concentrations in the plants of Zhendao 10 wasn't significant (p > 0.05). Si significantly increased concentrations of P in shoots and roots of both rice cultivars (p < 0.05). However, Si didn't significantly affect formation of Fe plaque on root surface. These results suggest that the effects of Si application on rice growth and As uptake in As-contaminated soils may depend on type of rice cultivar and Si application level. Rice cultivar and Si application rate should be considered when Si application is used to mitigate As accumulation in rice.",Optimization of Sample Pretreatment based on Graphene Oxide Dispersed Acid Silica Gel for Determination of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers in Vegetables near an E-waste Recycling Plant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666386,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 01 22,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) derived from e-waste dismantling, tend to easily bioaccumulate in vegetables.

It was found that volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations gradually decreased via two attenuation mechanisms, namely dilution and biodegradation. It was estimated that the VOC concentrations will be below the Japanese limits within 30 years after stopping the active remediation in 2003, which suggests that there is a high possibility that monitored natural attenuation can be adopted as the clean-up method at this contaminated site. The risk levels of VOCs at the present time are much lower than those at the time when the contamination was discovered. Vinyl chloride still presents a risk in some wells, and there were occasional unexpected increases in the risk levels of tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and cis-1,2-dichloloethylene, which means that continuous monitoring of the groundwater is necessary for forecasting risk levels.",Osteoporotic vertebral deformity with endplate/cortex fracture is associated with higher further vertebral fracture risk: the Ms. OS (Hong Kong) study results.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666373,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2019 05 05,"Compared with vertebrae without deformity, vertebrae with mild/moderate deformity have a higher risk of endplate or/and cortex fracture (ecf).

We hypothesize that use of contact force (CF) irrigated tip catheters might increase procedural safety in pediatric patients compared to standard irrigated tip catheters, by decreasing the number of radiofrequency (RF) pulses required to obtain AP elimination. Seventy-one pediatric patients (13.7 ± 2.5 years, 45 male) with ventricular pre-excitation were enrolled in the study. CA was performed with a standard irrigated tip catheter up to June 2013 in 41 patients (Group S) and with a CF sensing irrigated tip catheter later on in 30 patients (Group CF). In the Group CF, RF was applied with a minimal CF of 5 g; CF > 35 g was avoided. Group CF procedures required less fluoroscopy (6.8 ± 4.8 min), compared to Group S (12.2 ± 10.8 min, p = 0.007). The number of RF pulses was smaller in Group CF compared to Group S (2.5 ± 2.0 vs 5.5 ± 1.9, p < 0.01). The mean CF during the effective RF pulse was 18 ± 7.7 g, force-time integral was 1040.7 ± 955.9 gs, Ablation Index was 513.0 ± 214.2. The procedure was acutely successful in 70 patients; at 12 months follow-up 2 patients had AP recurrence, one for each group. No major complications were reported. The use of CF irrigated tip catheters was associated with a smaller number of RF pulses and less fluoroscopy, as compared to mapping and ablation with standard irrigated tip catheters.",Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis as a predictor of survival in metastatic melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666357,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",2019 04 16,"Gastrointestinal (GI) immune-related adverse events (irAEs) commonly limit immune checkpoint inhibitors' (ICIs) treatment, which is very effective for metastatic melanoma.

The adduct with N-terminal valine in globin [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine (HEV)] has been used in biomonitoring of cumulative exposures to EO. Here we studied in rats the fate of EO-adducted N-termini of globin after life termination of the erythrocytes. Rat erythrocytes were incubated with EO to produce the HEV levels in globin at 0.4-13.2 µmol/g as determined after acidic hydrolysis. Alternative hydrolysis of the isolated globin with enzyme pronase afforded N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-L-valyl-L-leucine (HEVL) and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-L-valyl-L-histidine (HEVH), the EO-adducted N-terminal dipeptides of rat globin α- and β-chains, respectively. The ratio of HEVL/HEVH (1:3) reflected higher reactivity of EO with the β-chain. The EO-modified erythrocytes were then given intravenously to the recipient rats. HEVL and HEVH were found to be the ultimate cleavage products excreted in the rat urine. Finally, rats were dosed intraperitoneally with EO, 50 mg/kg. Herein, the initial level of globin-bound HEVL (11.7 ± 1.3 nmol/g) decreased almost linearly over 60 days corresponding to the life span of rat erythrocytes. Daily urinary excretion of HEVL was almost constant for 30-40 days, decreasing faster in the subsequent phase of elimination. Recoveries of the total urinary HEVL from its globin-bound form were 84 ± 6% and 101 ± 17% after administrations of EO and the EO-modified erythrocytes, respectively. In conclusion, urinary HEVL appears to be a promising novel non-invasive biomarker of human exposures to EO.",Interleukin-6 Inhibitor Suppresses Hyperalgesia Without Improvement in Osteoporosis in a Mouse Pain Model of Osteoporosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666355,Calcified tissue international,2019 05 16,"The aim of this study was to evaluate skeletal pain associated with osteoporosis and examine the inhibitory effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on pain in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. The mechanism of osteoporotic pain in OVX mice was evaluated by examining pain-related behavior and immunohistochemistry. The effects of IL-6 receptor inhibitor (IL-6i) on these parameters were also assessed. Eight-week-old female ddY mice were ovariectomized and assigned to three groups: OVX mice treated with vehicle (OVX); OVX mice treated with alendronate (OVX-ALN); and OVX mice treated with anti-IL-6 receptor (anti-IL-6R) antibody (OVX-IL6i). Sham-operated mice were treated with vehicle. Immediately after surgery, vehicle, ALN, or anti-IL-6R antibody was injected subcutaneously. After a 4-week treatment, mechanical sensitivity was examined using von Frey filaments. The bilateral distal femoral metaphyses and proximal tibial metaphyses were analyzed three-dimensionally with micro-computed tomography. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression in L3-L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was examined using immunohistochemistry. Ovariectomy induced bone loss and mechanical hyperalgesia in the hindlimbs with upregulation of CGRP expression in the DRG neurons innervating the hindlimbs. ALN treatment prevented bone loss, but anti-IL-6R antibody treatment had no effect on bone morphometry compared with that of the OVX group. However, mechanical hyperalgesia and CGRP expression were significantly decreased in the OVX-IL6i and OVX-ALN groups compared with those in the OVX group. Although anti-IL-6R antibody treatment had no effect on ovariectomy-induced bone loss, the treatment prevented ovariectomy-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the hindlimbs and suppressed CGRP expression in DRG neurons. The results suggest that IL-6 is one of the causes of postmenopausal osteoporotic pain, and anti-IL-6R antibody might preserve bone health and decrease osteoporotic pain.",Baseball and Softball Pitchers are Distinct Within-Subject Controlled Models for Exploring Proximal Femur Adaptation to Physical Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666354,Calcified tissue international,2019 05 01,"Within-subject controlled models in individuals who preferentially load one side of the body enable efficient exploration of the skeletal benefits of physical activity. There is no established model of physical activity-induced side-to-side differences (i.e., asymmetry) at the proximal femur. Proximal femur asymmetry was assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in male jumping athletes (JMP, n = 16), male baseball pitchers (BB, n = 21), female fast-pitch softball pitchers (SB, n = 22), and controls (CON, n = 42). The jumping leg was the dominant leg in JMP, whereas in BB, SB and CON the dominant leg was contralateral to the dominant/throwing arm. BB and SB had 5.5% (95% CI 3.9-7.0%) and 6.5% (95% CI 4.8-8.2%) dominant-to-nondominant leg differences for total hip areal bone mineral density (aBMD), with the asymmetry being greater than both CON and JMP (p < 0.05). BB and SB also possessed dominant-to-nondominant leg differences in femoral neck and trochanteric aBMD (p < 0.001). SB had 9.7% (95% CI 6.4-13.0%) dominant-to-nondominant leg differences in femoral neck bone mineral content, which was larger than any other group (p ≤ 0.006). At the narrow neck, SB had large (> 8%) dominant-to-nondominant leg differences in cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia and section modulus, which were larger than any other group (p ≤ 0.02).

Most FPs currently used are members of the green fluorescent protein super-family, but new fluorophores such as bilin-FPs are being developed and optimized. In particular, the UnaG FP incorporates bilirubin (BR) as a chromophore, enhancing its fluorescence quantum yield by three orders of magnitude relative to that in solution. To investigate the mechanism of this dramatic enhancement and provide a basis for further engineering of UnaG and other tetrapyrrole-based fluorophores, we performed picosecond fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption measurements of BR bound to UnaG and its N57A site-directed mutant. The dynamics of wt-UnaG, which has a fluorescence QY of 0.51, are largely homogeneous, showing an excited state relaxation of ∼200 ps, and a 2.2 ns excited-state lifetime decay with a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.1 for D2O vs. H2O buffer. In contrast, for UnaG N57A (fluorescence QY 0.01) the results show a large spectral inhomogeneity with excited state decay timescales of 47 and 200 ps and a KIE of 1.4. The non-radiative deactivation of the excited state is limited by proton transfer. The loss of direct hydrogen bonds to the endo-vinyl dipyrrinone moiety of BR leads to high flexibility and structural heterogeneity of UnaG N57A, as seen in the X-ray crystal structure.",Correction: Correlation between Cu ion migration behaviour and deNOx activity in Cu-SSZ-13 for the standard NH3-SCR reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666331,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 15,"Correction for 'Correlation between Cu ion migration behaviour and deNOx activity in Cu-SSZ-13 for the standard NH3-SCR reaction' by A.

In this study, we synthesized nanoflake-assembled flower-like Bi2O2CO3 and homodisperse nanoflakes Bi2O2CO3 with exposed {110} and {001} facets (110-BOC and 001-BOC), respectively, to probe the activation and reaction mechanism of facet-dependent reactants. The results showed that Bi2O2CO3 with exposed {001} facets exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic abatement of NO in the air in comparison with 110-BOC. According to the combined results of ESR spectra and DFT calculation, the superior photocatalytic activity of 001-BOC stemmed from its enhanced capability to activate the reactants (O2 and H2O), which facilitated the formation of reactive radicals to participate in the photocatalytic NO oxidation. Most significantly, the time-dependent in situ DRIFTS spectra and DFT simulation results reveal that the adsorption activation of pollutants and desorption mechanisms of products were different for 110-BOC and 001-BOC in photocatalytic NO oxidation. Due to the differences in the atomic arrangement on the {110} and {001} facets, 001-BOC enabled the transformation of NO into NO- or cis-N2O22- during adsorption activation, while 110-BOC induces the adsorption activation of NO into NO+ or N2O3. The {001} facet of Bi2O2CO3 could promote the oxidation of intermediates to final products (NO3-) and enhance NO3- desorption. These different adsorption activation patterns on {110} and {001} facets essentially predetermined the facet-dependent conversion pathways of photocatalytic NO oxidation on different facets.

The data provided include measurements for each component of the brake system (i.e. the acceleration measurements on the two pads and the caliper and the normal displacements of the disc), as well as a complete measurement of sounds and squeal noise in near-field and in far-field during a braking test.

Methods & clinical development,2019 01 24,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are currently the most popular vector platform technology for ocular gene therapy. While transduction efficiency and tropism of intravitreally administered AAV has been fairly well established in various retinal conditions, its transduction pattern in diabetic retinas has not previously been characterized. Here, we describe the transduction efficiencies of four different AAV serotypes, AAV2, 5, 8, and 9, in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse retinas after intravitreal injections, which differed according to the duration of diabetic induction. STZ was intraperitoneally injected into C57/B6 diabetic mice subjected to unilateral intravitreal injection of AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, and AAV9 packaged with EGFP. Significantly enhanced AAV2 and AAV9 transduction was observed in 2-month-old diabetic mouse retinas compared to the 2-week-old diabetic mouse retinas and nondiabetic, vector uninjected or injected retinas. Intravitreal injection of AAV5 or AAV8 serotype in 2-month- and 2-week-old diabetic mouse retinas did not show any significant vector transduction enhancement compared to the nondiabetic control retinas. The tropism of AAV2 and AAV9 in diabetic mouse retinas differed. AAV2 was transduced into various retinal cells, including Müller cells, microglia, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells, whereas AAV9 was effectively transduced only into RGC and horizontal cells. The expression levels of receptors and co-receptors for AAV2 and AAV9 were significantly increased in 2-month-old diabetic mouse retinas. The results of our study demonstrated that AAV2 and AAV9 may be the vector of choice in treating diabetic retinopathy (DR) with gene therapy, and DR-related retinal changes may improve AAV vector transduction efficiency.",Kinetics and MR-Based Monitoring of AAV9 Vector Delivery into Cerebrospinal Fluid of Nonhuman Primates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666308,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2019 01 24,"Here we evaluated the utility of MRI to monitor intrathecal infusions in nonhuman primates. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) spiked with gadoteridol, a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent, enabled real-time visualization of infusions delivered either via cerebromedullary cistern, lumbar, cerebromedullary and lumbar, or intracerebroventricular infusion. The kinetics of vector clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed. Our results highlight the value of MRI in optimizing the delivery of infusate into CSF. In particular, MRI revealed differential patterns of infusate distribution depending on the route of delivery. Gadoteridol coverage analysis showed that cerebellomedullary cistern delivery was a reliable and effective route of injection, achieving broad infusate distribution in the brain and spinal cord, and was even greater when combined with lumbar injection. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection resulted in strong cortical coverage but little spinal distribution. Lumbar injection alone led to the distribution of MRI contrast agent mainly in the spinal cord with little cortical coverage, but this delivery route was unreliable. Similarly, vector clearance analysis showed differences between different routes of delivery. Overall, our data support the value of monitoring CSF injections to dissect different patterns of gadoteridol distribution based on the route of intrathecal administration.",Engineering and Design of Chimeric Antigen Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666307,Molecular therapy.

The aim was to investigate the effects of dietary linseed supplementation on the intramuscular fat composition, and the shelf-life of minced beef. The L diet did not alter the dressing rate and daily weight gain, whereas the C18:3n-3 content in the intramuscular fat significantly increased (from 0.85 to 1.78 g/100 g of total fatty acid, +109%), leading to a reduction in a n-6/n-3 ratio below four and an increase in the overall proportion of long chain n-3 fatty acids in beef lipids. These effects were principally related to differences in the distribution of fatty acids between the neutral and polar lipids. The results demonstrated that linseed supplementation modified the lipid composition of beef, without negatively impacting overall productivity, in the period from weaning the bull until its slaughter. However, the total amount of n-3 fatty acids in the beef of young bulls on the L diet, was not sufficient for the aliquot of humans' n-3 fatty acid requirements. This was mainly related to the low levels of fat in the beef. Comparing beef samples from animals on the L diet, with samples from animals on the C diet, the higher levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids led to a significant reduction of shelf-life starting after 2 days of storage at 4°C, because of fatty acid and cholesterol oxidation. The L diet group samples showed a higher level of TBARS (+80%) and COPs (+73%), two important parameters to estimate the oxidation level of beef. This suggests that enriching beef with n-3 fatty acids should be coupled with packaging techniques that consider the higher susceptibility to lipid oxidation. In conclusion, dietary linseed supplementation led to a higher proportion of n-3 fatty acids in beef lipids, however, the natural content of antioxidant substances was not able to protect intramuscular fat from oxidation during storage at 4°C.",Wnt Pathway in Bone Repair and Regeneration - What Do We Know So Far.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666305,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 01 24,"Wnt signaling plays a central regulatory role across a remarkably diverse range of functions during embryonic development, including those involved in the formation of bone and cartilage. Wnt signaling continues to play a critical role in adult osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Disruptions in this highly-conserved and complex system leads to various pathological conditions, including impaired bone healing, autoimmune diseases and malignant degeneration. For reconstructive surgeons, critically sized skeletal defects represent a major challenge. These are frequently associated with significant morbidity in both the recipient and donor sites. The Wnt pathway is an attractive therapeutic target with the potential to directly modulate stem cells responsible for skeletal tissue regeneration and promote bone growth, suggesting that Wnt factors could be used to promote bone healing after trauma.

This technique is safe and provides more than adequate visualization, as well as a dry environment, to make the arthroscopic application of BC significantly more efficient.","Ewing sarcoma of the mobile spine; predictive factors for survival, neurological function and local control. A Scandinavian sarcoma group study with a mean follow-up of 12 years.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666289,Journal of bone oncology,2019 02 07,"Object: Many patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES) of the mobile spine present with neurologic symptoms leading to emergency decompressive surgery. Only rarely is optimal treatment involving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by en bloc excision possible. The purpose of this study was to study treatment, neurologic and oncologic outcome in patients with ES of the mobile spine. Methods: Twenty-four patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2012 were identified through the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group registry. Charts were reviewed in order to assess details in patient characteristics, neurologic status, treatment and outcome. Prognostic factors were analyzed with respect to local control, disease-free survival and overall survival. Results: Neurologic symptoms were frequently observed at presentation, being present in 19/23 patients with documented neurologic status. Most (13/19) patients had a complete neurologic recovery regardless of whether or not emergency decompressive surgery was performed. The majority (18/24) of patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy. However, only 9/17 received the recommended dose of  ≥  50.4 Gy. The disease-free and overall survival rates were 48% and 57% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The local recurrence rates were 19% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Only year of diagnosis, categorized into periods with significant changes in chemotherapy protocols, was a significant factor for local recurrence, but there was a trend (p = 0.06) for an increased risk of a local recurrence if emergency decompressive surgery was performed. Conclusion: Patients with ES of the mobile have a relatively favorable prognosis. Nonetheless, local recurrence rate is high for this group of patients for which local treatment mainly relies on definitive radiotherapy. Emergency decompressive surgery may increase the risk for local recurrence.",Incidence of skeletal-related events among multiple myeloma patients in the United States at oncology clinics: Observations from real-world data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666288,Journal of bone oncology,2019 06 10,"Skeletal-related events (SREs) are common bone complications in multiple myeloma (MM). However, there are few real-world reports of their incidence. In this study, a database of oncology electronic health records was linked to administrative claims data. Patients identified were aged ≥18 years and newly diagnosed with MM, had ≥1 clinic visit within 1 month of diagnosis, and ≥1 year of follow-up after diagnosis. The study period was January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016. 343 patients were included, 35% of whom had a baseline history of any SRE. During a median follow-up of 25.7 months, 34% of patients experienced SREs after diagnosis. Median time to SRE was 167 days. Among patients experiencing an SRE, 68% had an SRE within the first year. The incidence rate of SREs at 1 year following MM diagnosis for patients with baseline history was 103/100 person-years (PY) versus 16/100PY for patients without baseline history. SRE incidence rates within 3 months of initiating a line of therapy increased with subsequent lines (line 1: 81/100PY, line 2: 118/100PY, line 3: 150/100PY). Risk of SREs was similar across different anti-MM regimens, including proteasome inhibitor-based regimens. These results highlight the importance of continued surveillance and management of MM-associated bone disease.",The need for bone biopsies in the diagnosis of new bone lesions in patients with a known primary malignancy: A comparative review of 117 biopsy cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666287,Journal of bone oncology,2019 02 07,"This study used a clinical dataset to investigate the proportion of the newly found bone lesions in malignant patients diagnosed by biopsy as being benign, malignant but unrelated to the primary malignancy, or bone metastases of the primary malignancy. The clinical factors that might affect the correlation between bone lesions and the primary malignancy were also analyzed. It is expected to obtain some information contributing to the clinical decision-making regarding the need for biopsy of these lesions from the research results.","Communication of cancer screening results by letter, telephone or in person: A mixed methods systematic review of the effect on attendee anxiety, understanding and preferences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666286,Preventive medicine reports,2019 01 24,"Attending and receiving a result from screening can be an anxious process. Using an appropriate method to deliver screening results could improve communication and reduce negative outcomes for screening attendees. Screening programmes are increasingly communicating results by letter or telephone rather than in-person. We investigated the impact of communication methods on attendees. We systematically reviewed the literature on the communication methods used to deliver results in cancer screening programmes for women, focusing on screening attendee anxiety, understanding of results and preferences for results communication. We included qualitative and quantitative research. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Embase. Results were analysed using framework synthesis. 10,558 papers were identified with seven studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Several key ideas emerged from the synthesis including speed, accuracy of results, visual support, ability to ask questions, privacy of results location and managing expectations. Verbal communication methods (telephone and in-person) were preferred and facilitated greater understanding than written methods, although there was considerable variability in attendee preferences. Findings for anxiety were mixed, with no clear consensus on which method of communication might minimise attendee anxiety. The low number of identified studies and generally low quality evidence suggest we do not know the most appropriate communication methods in the delivery of cancer screening results. More research is needed to directly compare methods of results communication, focusing on what impact each method may have on screening attendees.",The importance and implications of comparator selection in pharmacoepidemiologic research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666285,Current epidemiology reports,2019 01 24,"Pharmacoepidemiologic studies employing large databases are critical to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drug exposures in large and diverse populations. Because treatment is not randomized, researchers must select a relevant comparison group for the treatment of interest. The comparator group can consist of individuals initiating: (1) a similarly indicated treatment (active comparator), (2) a treatment used for a different indication (inactive comparator) or (3) no particular treatment (non-initiators).

The macrophytes in genus Ottelia were featured for their broad leaves, which might consequently produce specialized functions that differed from other submerged species. To explore the potential ecological role of Ottelia, a field investigation was conducted on leaf traits in eight populations of Ottelia ranging from the southwestern Yunnan-Guizhou plateau to the southern Hainan island in China covering a distance of >1,700 km. The eight populations included all the extant Ottelia species and varieties in China except the well-documented O. alismoides. Carbon-related traits [bicarbonate usage, photosynthetic characteristics, capability of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)], pigment content and parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence, morphology and mass of the leaves were determined. The different populations showed distinct functional traits of mature leaves; O. acuminata var. songmingensis had the thickest and longest leaf with CaCO3 precipitation on the both sides of the leaf, and O. cordata showed putative CAM activity with the highest diel acidity changes 12.5 μequiv g-1 FW. Our results indicated an important role of Ottelia populations in carbon cycling as the dominant species in karst freshwaters in China.",The R2R3-MYB Factor FhMYB5 From Freesia hybrida Contributes to the Regulation of Anthocyanin and Proanthocyanidin Biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666265,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"The flavonoids are important and nourishing compounds for plants and human. The transcription regulation of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis was extensively studied in dicot compared with monocot plants. In this study, we characterized the functionality of an R2R3-MYB gene FhMYB5 from the monocotyledonous flowering plant of Iridaceae, Freesia hybrida. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis implied that FhMYB5 was clustered into grapevine VvMYB5b subclade. Correlation analysis indicated that the spatio-temporal expression patterns of FhMYB5 coincided well with anthocyanin and PA accumulations in Freesia per se. Furthermore, transient transfection assays in Freesia protoplasts revealed that the late flavonoid biosynthetic genes (e.g., DFR and LDOX) were slightly up-regulated by FhMYB5 alone, whereas both early and late biosynthetic genes were significantly activated when FhMYB5 were co-infected with either of the two IIIf clade bHLH genes, FhTT8L and FhGL3L. Moreover, these results were further confirmed by co-transfection of FhMYB5 with either of the bHLH genes aforementioned into protoplasts expressing GUS reporter gene driven by Freesia promoters. In addition, the overexpression of FhMYB5 in tobacco and Arabidopsis could also significantly up-regulate the expression of genes participating in the general flavonoid pathway. In conclusion, FhMYB5 was proved to function in the general flavonoid pathway in Freesia. The results implied a function conservation of flavonoid biosynthesis related MYB regulators in angiosperm plants.","Plant Phenotyping Research Trends, a Science Mapping Approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666264,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"Modern plant phenotyping, often using non-invasive technologies and digital technologies, is an emerging science and provides essential information on how genetics, epigenetics, environmental pressures, and crop management (farming) can guide selection toward productive plants suitable for their environment. Thus, phenotyping is at the forefront of future plant breeding. Bibliometric science mapping is a quantitative method that analyzes scientific publications throughout the terms present in their title, abstract, and keywords. The aim of this mapping exercise is to observe trends and identify research opportunities. This allows us to analyze the evolution of phenotyping research and to predict emerging topics of this discipline. A total of 1,827 scientific publications fitted our search method over the last 20 years. During the period 1997-2006, the total number of publications was only around 6.1%. The number of publications increased more steeply after 2010, boosted by the overcoming of technological bias and by a set of key developments at hard and software level (image analysis and data storage management, automation and robotics). Cluster analysis evidenced three main groups linked to genetics, physiology, and imaging. Mainly the model plant ""Arabidopsis thaliana"" and the crops ""rice"" and ""triticum"" species were investigated in the literature. The last two species were studied when addressing ""plant breeding,"" and ""genomic selection."" However, currently the trend goes toward a higher diversity of phenotyped crops and research in the field. The application of plant phenotyping in the field is still under rapid development and this application has strong linkages with precision agriculture. EU co-authors were involved in 41.8% of the analyzed papers, followed by USA (15.4%), Australia (6.0%), and India (5.6%). Within the EU, coauthors were mainly affiliated in Germany (35.8%), France (23.7%), and United Kingdom (18.4%). Time seems right for new opportunities to incentivize research on more crops, in real field conditions, and to spread knowledge toward more countries, including emerging economies. Science mapping offers the possibility to get insights into a wide amount of bibliographic information, making them more manageable, attractive, and easy to serve science policy makers, stakeholders, and research managers.",The Rice SPOTTED LEAF4 (SPL4) Encodes a Plant Spastin That Inhibits ROS Accumulation in Leaf Development and Functions in Leaf Senescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666263,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) are usually controlled by single recessive mutations that cause the formation of necrotic lesions without pathogen invasion. These genetic defects are useful to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of defense-related programmed cell death in plants. Molecular evidence has been suggested that some of LMMs are closely associated with the regulation of leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we characterized the mutation underlying spotted leaf4 (spl4), which results in lesion formation and also affects leaf senescence in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that the γ ray-induced spl4-1 mutant has a single base substitution in the splicing site of the SPL4 locus, resulting in a 13-bp deletion within the encoded microtubule-interacting-and-transport (MIT) spastin protein containing an AAA-type ATPase domain. The T-DNA insertion spl4-2 mutant exhibited spontaneous lesions similar to those of the spl4-1 mutant, confirming that SPL4 is responsible for the LMM phenotype. In addition, both spl4 mutants exhibited delayed leaf yellowing during dark-induced or natural senescence. Western blot analysis of spl4 mutant leaves suggested possible roles for SPL4 in the degradation of photosynthetic proteins. Punctate signals of SPL4-fused fluorescent proteins were detected in the cytoplasm, similar to the cellular localization of animal spastin. Based on these findings, we propose that SPL4 is a plant spastin that is involved in multiple aspects of leaf development, including senescence.","Phenotypic, Hormonal, and Genomic Variation Among Vitis vinifera Clones With Different Cluster Compactness and Reproductive Performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666262,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"Previous studies showed that the number of berries is a major component of the compactness level of the grapevine clusters. Variation in number of fruits is regulated by events occurring in the fruitset, but also before during the flower formation and pollination, through factors like the initial number of flowers or the gametic viability. Therefore, the identification of the genetic bases of this variation would provide an invaluable knowledge of the grapevine reproductive development and useful tools for managing yield and cluster compactness. We performed the phenotyping of four clones (two compact and two loose clones) of the Tempranillo cultivar with reproducible different levels of cluster compactness over seasons. Measures of reproductive performance included flower number per inflorescence, berry number per cluster, fruitset, coulure, and millerandage indices. Besides, their levels of several hormones during the inflorescence and flower development were determined, and their transcriptomes were evaluated at critical time points (just before the start and at the end of flowering). For some key reproductive traits, like number of berries per cluster and number of seeds per berry, clones bearing loose clusters showed differences with the compact clones and also differed from each other, indicating that each one follows different paths to produce loose clusters. Variation between clones was observed for abscisic acid and gibberellins levels at particular development stages, and differences in GAs could be related to phenotypic differences. Likewise, various changes between clones were found at the transcriptomic level, mostly just before the start of flowering. Several of the differentially expressed genes between one of the loose clones and the compact clones are known to be over-expressed in pollen, and many of them were related to cell wall modification processes or to the phenylpropanoids metabolism. We also found polymorphisms between clones in candidate genes that could be directly involved in the variation of the compactness level.",Structural and Functional Characterization of PR-4 SUGARWINs From Sugarcaneand Their Role in Plant Defense.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666261,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"SUGARWIN1 and 2 are defense proteins from sugarcane. Their gene expression is known to be induced in response to wound and Diatraea saccharalis damage. Although the recombinant SUGARWIN protein does not affect insect development, it promotes significant morphological and physiological changes in Fusarium verticillioides and Colletotrichum falcatum, which lead to fungal cell death via apoptosis. In this study, we deepen our understanding of the role of SUGARWINs in plant defense and the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins affect fungi by elucidating their molecular targets. Our results show that SUGARWINs play an important role in plant defense against opportunistic pathogens. We demonstrated that SUGARWINs are induced by C. falcatum, and the induction of SUGARWINs can vary among sugarcane varieties. The sugarcane variety exhibiting the highest level of SUGARWIN induction exhibited a considerable reduction in C. falcatum infection. Furthermore, SUGARWIN1 exhibited ribonuclease, chitosanase, and chitinase activity, whereas SUGARWIN2 exhibited only chitosanase activity. This variable enzymatic specificity seems to be the result of divergent amino acid composition within the substrate-binding site.",Effects of Two Doses of Organic Extract-Based Biostimulant on Greenhouse Lettuce Grown Under Increasing NaCl Concentrations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666260,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"The enhancement of plant tolerance toward abiotic stresses is increasingly being supported by the application of biostimulants. Salinity represents a serious problem in the Mediterranean region. To verify the effects deriving from the application of biostimulants, trials on Romaine lettuce plants under salt exposure were performed, in greenhouse. Plants were subjected to three NaCl solutions with 0.8, 1.3, and 1.8 dS/m of electrical conductivity. The volume of the solution was 200 mL/plant and delivered every 3 days. Biostimulant treatments started after crop establishment and were: control (water) and two doses (0.1 or 0.2 mL/plant) of the commercial biostimulant Retrosal® (Valagro S.p.A), containing calcium, zinc, and specific active ingredients. Four Retrosal® treatments were applied, every 7 days, directly to the substrate. Non-destructive analyses were conducted to assess the effects on leaf photosynthetic efficiency. At harvest, plants fresh weight (FW) and dry weight were determined, as well as the concentration of chlorophylls, carotenoids, total sugars, nitrate, proline, and abscisic acid (ABA). The biostimulant tested increased significantly the FW of lettuce (+65% in the highest dose) compared to controls. Results indicate that treatments positively affected the chlorophyll content measured in vivo (+45% in the highest dose) and that a general positive effect was observable on net photosynthesis rate. Retrosal® seems to improve the gas exchanges under our experimental conditions. The total sugars levels were not affected by treatments. Biostimulant allowed maintaining nitrate concentration similar to the untreated and unstressed controls. The increasing levels of water salinity caused a raise in proline concentration in control plants (+85%); biostimulant treatments at 0.2 mL/plant dose kept lower the proline levels. All plants treated with the biostimulant showed lower value of ABA (-34%) compared to controls. Results revealed that Retrosal® is able to stimulate plant growth independently from the salinity exposure. However, treated plants reached faster the commercial maturity stage. The fresh biomass of control at the end of experiment, after 30 days, ranged from 15 to 42 g/head, while in biostimulant treated plants ranged from 45 to 94 g/head. The product applied at maximum dose seems to be the most effective in our experimental conditions.",Novel Plastid-Nuclear Genome Combinations Enhance Resistance to Citrus Canker in Cybrid Grapefruit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666259,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 24,"Host disease resistance is the most desirable strategy for control of citrus canker, a disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. However, no resistant commercial citrus cultivar has been identified. Cybridization, a somatic hybridization approach that combines the organelle and nuclear genomes from different species, was used to create cybrids between citrus canker resistant 'Meiwa' kumquat (Fortunella crassifolia Swingle snym. Citrus japonica Thunb.) and susceptible grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfad) cultivars. From these fusions, cybrids with grapefruit nucleus, kumquat mitochondria and kumquat chloroplasts and cybrids with grapefruit nucleus, kumquat mitochondria and grapefruit chloroplasts were generated. These cybrids showed a range of citrus canker response, but all cybrids with kumquat chloroplasts had a significantly lower number of lesions and lower Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri populations than the grapefruit controls. Cybrids with grapefruit chloroplasts had a significantly higher number of lesions than those with kumquat chloroplasts. To understand the role of chloroplasts in the cybrid disease defense, quantitative PCR was performed on both cybrid types and their parents to examine changes in gene expression during Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri infection. The results revealed chloroplast influences on nuclear gene expression, since isonuclear cybrids and 'Marsh' grapefruit had different gene expression profiles. In addition, only genotypes with kumquat chloroplasts showed an early up-regulation of reactive oxygen species genes upon Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri infection. These cybrids have the potential to enhance citrus canker resistance in commercial grapefruit orchards. They also serve as models for understanding the contribution of chloroplasts to plant disease response and raise the question of whether other alien chloroplast genotypes would condition similar results.",Endocytic Recycling of MHC Class I Molecules in Non-professional Antigen Presenting and Dendritic Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666258,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 24,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules are glycoproteins that display peptide epitopes at the cell surface of nucleated cells for recognition by CD8+ T cells. Like other cell surface receptors, MHC class I molecules are continuously removed from the surface followed by intracellular degradation or recycling to the cell surface, in a process likely involving active quality control the mechanism of which remains unknown. The molecular players and pathways involved in internalization and recycling have previously been studied in model cell lines such as HeLa. However, dendritic cells (DCs), which rely on a specialized endocytic machinery that confers them the unique ability to ""cross""-present antigens acquired by internalization, may use distinct MHC I recycling pathways and quality control mechanisms. By providing MHC I molecules cross-presenting antigens, these pathways may play an important role in one of the key functions of DCs, priming of T cell responses against pathogens and tumors. In this review, we will focus on endocytic recycling of MHC I molecules in various experimental conditions and cell types. We discuss the organization of the recycling pathway in model cell lines compared to DCs, highlighting the differences in the recycling rates and pathways of MHC I molecules between various cell types, and their putative functional consequences. Reviewing the literature, we find that conclusive evidence for significant recycling of MHC I molecules in primary DCs has yet to be demonstrated. We conclude that endocytic trafficking of MHC class I in DCs remains poorly understood and should be further studied because of its likely role in antigen cross-presentation.",Pneumococcal Immunization Reduces Neurological and Hepatic Symptoms in a Mouse Model for Niemann-Pick Type C1 Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666257,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 24,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is caused by a deleterious mutation in the Npc1 gene, causing lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids. Consequently, NPC1 disease patients suffer from severe neurovisceral symptoms which, in the absence of effective treatments, result in premature death. NPC1 disease patients display increased plasma levels of cholesterol oxidation products such as those enriched in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a pro-inflammatory mediator. While it has been shown that inflammation precedes and exacerbates symptom severity in NPC1 disease, it is unclear whether oxLDL contributes to NPC1 disease progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing anti-oxLDL IgM autoantibodies on systemic and neurological symptoms in an NPC1 disease mouse model. For this purpose, Npc1

 . In line with these results, brain analyses showed an improved cerebellar phenotype and neuroinflammation in comparison with control-treated subjects. This study highlights the potential of the pneumococcal immunization as a novel therapeutical approach in NPC1 disease.

The overwhelming experience over the past several years teaches us that ZIKV and the associated neurological complications represent a long-term world-wide challenge to public health. Although the number of ZIKV cases in the Western Hemisphere has dropped since 2016, the need for basic research and anti-ZIKV drug development remains strong. Re-emerging viruses like ZIKV are an ever-present threat in the 21st century where fast transcontinental travel lends itself to viral epidemics. Here, we first present the origin story for ZIKV and review the rapid progress researchers have made toward understanding of the ZIKV pathology and in the design, re-purposing, and testing-particularly in vivo-drug candidates for ZIKV prophylaxis and therapy ZIKV. Quite remarkably, a short, but intensive, drug-repurposing effort has already resulted in several readily available FDA-approved drugs that are capable of effectively combating the virus in infected adult mouse models and, most importantly, in both preventing maternal-fetal transmission and severe microcephaly in newborns in pregnant mouse models.",Ammonium Nitrogen Tolerant Chlorella Strain Screening and Its Damaging Effects on Photosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666245,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"Nitrogen is an essential nutrient element. Ammonium nitrogen, one of the most common nitrogen sources, is found in various habitats, especially wastewater. However, excessive amounts of ammonium nitrogen can be toxic to phytoplankton, higher plants, fish, and other animals, and microorganisms. In this study, we explored the tolerance of green algae to ammonium nitrogen using 10 Chlorella strains. High concentrations of ammonium nitrogen directly inhibited the growth of Chlorella, but the degree of inhibition varied by strain. With the EC50 of 1.6 and 0.4 g L-1, FACHB-1563 and FACHB-1216, respectively had the highest and lowest tolerance to ammonium nitrogen among all strains tested, suggesting that FACHB-1563 could potentially be used to remove excess ammonium nitrogen from wastewater in bioremediation efforts. Two strains with the highest and lowest tolerance to ammonium nitrogen were selected to further explore the inhibitory effect of ammonium nitrogen on Chlorella.

Over 16 months, we used flow cytometry to characterize the abundance and growth of four physiological groups of heterotrophic bacteria: membrane-intact (Live), high and low nucleic acid content (HNA and LNA) and actively respiring (CTC+) cells in shallow coastal waters. Chlorophyll a, dissolved organic matter (DOC and DON) concentrations, and their fluorescent properties were also measured as proxies of bottom-up control. We performed short-term incubations (6 days) with the whole microbial community (Community treatment), and with the bacterial community only after removing predators by filtration (Filtered treatment). Initial bacterial abundances ranged from 1.46 to 4.80 × 105 cells mL-1. Total specific growth rates in the Filtered treatment ranged from 0.76 to 2.02 d-1. Live and HNA cells displayed similar seasonal patterns, with higher values during late summer and fall (2.13 and 2.33 d-1, respectively) and lower in late spring (1.02 and 1.01 d-1, respectively). LNA cells were outgrown by the other physiological groups (0.33-1.08 d-1) while CTC+ cells (0.28-1.85 d-1) showed weaker seasonality. The Filtered treatment yielded higher bacterial abundances than the Community treatment in all but 2 of the incubations, and carrying capacities peaked in November 2016 (1.04 × 106 cells mL-1), with minimum values (3.61 × 105 cells mL-1) observed in May 2017. The high temperatures experienced from May through October 2016 (33.4 ± 0.4°C) did not constrain the growth of heterotrophic bacteria. Indeed, bacterial growth efficiencies were positively correlated with environmental temperature, reflecting the presence of more labile compounds (high DON concentrations resulting in lower C:N ratios) in summer. The overall high specific growth rates and the consistently higher carrying capacities in the Filtered treatment suggest that strong top-down control by protistan grazers was the likely cause for the low heterotrophic bacteria abundances.","Trichoderma-Inoculation and Mowing Synergistically Altered Soil Available Nutrients, Rhizosphere Chemical Compounds and Soil Microbial Community, Potentially Driving Alfalfa Growth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666243,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"Trichoderma spp. are proposed as major plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPF) to increase plants growth and productivity. Mowing can stimulate aboveground regrowth to improve plant biomass and nutritional quality. However, the synergistic effects of Trichoderma and mowing on plants growth, particularly the underlying microbial mechanisms mediated by rhizosphere soil chemical compounds, have rarely been reported. In the present study, we employed Trichoderma harzianum T-63 and conducted a pot experiment to investigate the synergistic effect of Trichoderma-inoculation and mowing on alfalfa growth, and the potential soil microbial ecological mechanisms were also explored. Alfalfa treated with Trichoderma-inoculation and/or mowing (T, M, and TM) had significant (P < 0.05) increases in plant shoot and root dry weights and soil available nutrients (N, P, and K), compared with those of the control (CK). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) demonstrated that the rhizosphere chemical compounds and soil bacterial and fungal communities were, respectively, separated according to different treatments. There was a clear significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation between alfalfa biomass and the relative abundance of Trichoderma (R2 = 0.3451, P = 0.045). However, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Agrobacterium, and Actinoplanes were not significantly correlated with alfalfa biomass. According to structure equation modeling (SEM), Trichoderma abundance and available P served as primary contributors to alfalfa growth promotion. Additionally, Trichoderma-inoculation and mowing altered rhizosphere soil chemical compounds to drive the soil microbial community, indirectly influencing alfalfa growth. Our research provides a basis for promoting alfalfa growth from a soil microbial ecology perspective and may provide a scientific foundation for guiding the farming of alfalfa.",Insight Into the Distribution of Staphylococci and Their Enterotoxins in Cheeses Under Natural Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666242,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"Staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks are a major cause of food-borne illness in the European Union and their notification has been mandatory since 2005. Criteria for the enumeration of coagulase-positive Staphylococci (CPS) and the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in cheese have been set down in Commission Regulation EC 2073/2005. Currently, few information are available about the distribution of SEs in naturally contaminated cheeses, including raw-milk and artisanal dairy products. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate at both the CPS enumeration and the succession of the enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus and produced enterotoxins levels on the rind and the core of a raw-milk semi-hard cheese, produced on farm. The study has been conducted in three steps: (I) seven wheels at different time of ripening where tested for the presence of SEs. (II) from each wheel, four portions were subsequently sampled from four different areas (peripheral rind, central rind, peripheral core and central core). (III) two cheese wheels, characterized by the highest and lowest CPS numbers and SEs quantification, based on the second step of the study, were further analyzed. A significant difference has been observed in the distribution of CPS and SEs in the four areas sampled, irrespectively of the batch and the time of ripening. The results of this study provided a set of previously unknown information on the influence of natural conditions on the distribution of CPS and SEs thereof in the cheese matrix, filling a gap in the understanding of SEs biosynthesis process.","NrnC, an RNase D-Like Protein From Agrobacterium, Is a Novel Octameric Nuclease That Specifically Degrades dsDNA but Leaves dsRNA Intact.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666241,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"NrnC from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At_NrnC, UniProt accession number A9CG28) is a nuclease containing a single DEDDy domain. Here, we determined the structures of both the apo and metal-ion-bound forms of At_NrnC. Although the overall structure of the At_NrnC protomer is similar to that of the RNase D exonuclease domain, nuclease assays unexpectedly revealed that At_NrnC possesses remarkably different substrate specificity. In contrast to RNase D, which degrades both single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), At_NrnC hydrolyses ssRNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with high efficiency but does not degrade dsRNA. Crystal packing analysis and biochemical data indicated that At_NrnC forms an octameric hollow cylindrical structure that allows ssRNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA, but not dsRNA, to enter the central tunnel where the multiple active sites perform hydrolysis. This novel structural feature confers a high processivity and is responsible for the preference of At_NrnC for longer dsDNA substrates.",Diallyl Disulfide From Garlic Oil Inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa Quorum Sensing Systems and Corresponding Virulence Factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666240,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"Previously, we determined that diallyl disulfide (DADS) from garlic oil can inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 pathogenic factors by inactivating the transcription of key genes from three quorum sensing (QS) systems (las, rhl, and pqs) based on the effects of DADS on growth, virulence factor production (elastase, pyocyanin, biofilm, and swarming motility), and RNA transcription (real-time q-PCR). To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of the three P. aeruginosa QS systems by DADS, high-throughput RNA and proteome sequencing techniques were used to study differences in the transcriptional and proteome expression of P. aeruginosa PAO1 following treatment with DADS. The RNA-seq and proteomic data are available via NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession number GSE118801 and ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011144, respectively. The experimental results indicated that all key genes of the three QS systems (las, rhl, and pqs) of P. aeruginosa PAO1 as well as the virulence factors (including exoprotease LasA, elastase LasB, lectin LecA and LecB, pyocyanin biosynthesis, and biofilm formation) regulated by these three QS systems were inhibited. This is consistent with our previous studies on the physiology, biochemistry, and RNA expression of P. aeruginosa treated with DADS. Additionally, our results also indicated that bacterial motility, chemotaxis, and two-component systems were inhibited by DADS treatment. All these changes abolish the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to environmental stimuli and cause the cells to be in a state of passivation. Further research is needed to determine how QS systems regulate these functions. Our findings could potentially contribute to the treatment and control of P. aeruginosa infection, virulence, and pathogenicity.",Identification of Specific Oral and Gut Pathogens in Full Thickness Colon of Colitis Patients: Implications for Colon Motility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666239,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 25,"Impaired colon motility is one of the leading problems associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An expanding body of evidence supports the role of microbiome in normal gut function and in progression of IBD. The objective of this work is to determine whether diseased full thickness colon specimens, including the neuromuscular region (critical for colon motility function), contain specific oral and gut pathogens. In addition, we compared the differences in colon microbiome between Caucasians (CA) and African Americans (AA). Thirty-nine human full thickness colon (diseased colon and adjacent healthy colon) specimens were collected from Crohn's Colitis (CC) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients while they underwent elective colon surgeries. We isolated and analyzed bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from colon specimens by amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene region. The microbiome proportions were quantified into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by analysis with Quantitative Insights Into Microbial ecology (QIIME) platform. Two hundred twenty-eight different bacterial species were identified by QIIME analysis. However, we could only decipher the species name of fifty-three bacteria. Our results show that proportion of non-detrimental bacteria in CC or UC colon samples were altered compared to adjacent healthy colon specimens. We further show, for the first time in full thickness colon specimens, that microbiome of CC and UC diseased specimens is dominated by putative oral pathogens belonging to the Phyla Firmicutes (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus), and Fusobacteria (Fusobacterium). In addition, we have identified patterns of differences in microbiome levels between CA and AA specimens with potential implications for health disparities research. Overall, our results suggest a significant association between oral and gut microbes in the modulation of colon motility in colitis patients.",Colistin Resistant A. baumannii: Genomic and Transcriptomic Traits Acquired Under Colistin Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666237,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"Even though colistin-based treatment represents the antimicrobial-regimen backbone for the management of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections, colistin resistance is still rare, at least as a full resistance, in Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab). We investigated the genomics and transcriptomics of two clinical Extensively Drug Resistance (XDR) colistin-susceptible/resistant (COL-S/R) Ab strain-pairs in which COL-resistance was developed after exposure to colistin therapy. The molecular characterization of the strains showed that all strains belonged to PFGE-A, ST-281, OXA-23 producers, Global Clone-II, and were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and susceptible to tigecycline, in agreement with NGS-acquired resistome. COL-R vs. COL-S Ab comparative genomics, mapping on Ab ATCC 17978 and Ab ACICU Reference Genomes, revealed a closely related genomic phylogeny, especially between strain-pair isolates, and distinctive common genomic non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in COL-R Ab strains. Furthermore, pmrB and pmrC nsSNPs were found. Notably we recovered, for the first time, lpxC and lpxD nsSNPs previously described only in ""in-vitro"" mutants and associated with colistin resistance in a clinical COL-R Ab. COL-R vs. COL-S Ab comparative transcriptomics evidenced a strain-dependent response to the colistin resistance onset highly variable among the single COL-R strains vs. their COL-S parents and merely seven common over-expressed transcripts, i.e. the PgaB lipoprotein for biofilm-matrix production, the diacylglycerol kinase for the lipid recycling in the membrane-derived oligosaccharide cycle, a membrane non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, the Lipid A phosphoethanol aminotransferase PmrC, and three hypothetical proteins. The transcript analysis of the ""COL-R related genes"" and the RNA-seq data confirmed pmrCAB over-expression responsible for a greater positive net cell-charge, and lpxACD under-expression in COL-R causing a decreased LPS production, as main mechanisms of colistin resistance. Our study reports the COL-R Ab genomic and transcriptomic signatures reflecting the interplay between several direct and indirect potential adaptations to antimicrobial pressure, including the occurrence of SNP accumulation hotspot loci in genes related to intrinsic or adaptive colistin resistance, surface adhesion proteins and porins, and over-expressed genes involved in different pathways, i.e. biofilm production, oxidative stress response, extensive drug and COL resistance.",Antimicrobial Susceptibility and Virulence Surveillance of Campylobacter spp. Isolated From Patients in Two Tertiary Medical Centers in Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666236,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 24,"Campylobacter spp. may cause fever, vomiting, and diarrhea in humans. Antibiotic treatment is suggested for patients with severe campylobacteriosis. However, the interpretative criteria for antibiotic susceptibility are inconsistent between Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines. The aim of the study is to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of cytolethal distending toxin genes and to evaluate antibiotic susceptibility testing methods in the clinical laboratories of two tertiary medical centers in Taiwan. In total, 236 bacterial isolates were collected between 2001 and 2014. The disk diffusion and E-test methods were used to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility, and broth dilution results were used as a reference. The virulence genes cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and ceuE were detected through polymerase chain reaction. The antimicrobial sensitivity rates for erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline using the broth dilution assay were 80.4, 5.4, and 3.4%, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates obtained from southern and northern Taiwan. However, some differences were observed between species. The susceptibility test for erythromycin (disk diffusion) showed that the isolates with small inhibition zone diameters were all resistant, and five isolates (4.0%) with large IZDs were non-sensitive. The error rate of the disk diffusion method according to the CLSI M45-A3 guideline was 5.4% (8/148). The incompatibility rates between the E-test and broth dilution methods for erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline were 8.0, 5.3, and 1.3%, respectively. The positive rates of the genes cdtA and cdtC were considerably higher in Campylobacter jejuni than in C. coli. Erythromycin is recommended as the first choice of treatment for campylobacteriosis. The disk diffusion method is suitable for prescreening Campylobacter susceptibility by using the CLSI M45-A2 and EUCAST criteria (low error rate of 3.4%). If antibiotic treatment fails or IZDs are between 6 and 20 mm, minimum inhibitory concentration testing by using the E-test method is highly recommended because the results of the E-test and broth dilution methods exhibit high agreement. The error rate of disk diffusion method using CLSI M45-A3 criteria is only slightly higher than B, which is also a suitable criteria."

When someone tries but fails to do a good deed, for example, it seems that it is ""the thought that counts."" However, research with slightly older children in the preschool years has produced mixed results: in some cases, children are solely considering the positive or negative outcome of an action when evaluating others, while in others, intention attributions are integrated. Such contradictory findings have prompted debate about the development of moral reasoning. Here, we examine extant research on early moral evaluation and propose that differences in the way that task procedures present intention and outcome information can (1) support or preclude young children's intention attribution and (2) alter the relative saliency or predominance of each kind of information. In turn, these differences would influence the frequency and degree to which young children generate intention-oriented moral evaluations.",The Trickle-Down Effect of Leaders' Pro-social Rule Breaking: Joint Moderating Role of Empowering Leadership and Courage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666224,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 24,"Based on social learning theory and humanistic cognitive behaviorism theory, this study examined the trickle-down effect of leader PSRB and its boundary conditions. We proposed a three-way interaction of leader PSRB, empowering leadership, and follower courage to predict follower PSRB. Data were collected from 174 leader-follower dyads. Multiple moderated regressions (MMR) revealed that leader PSRB was positively related to follower PSRB, and that the effect was stronger under conditions of high empowering leadership or high courage. A three-way interaction effect suggested that the positive relationship between leader PSRB and follower PSRB was strongest when both empowering leadership and courage were high. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications were discussed.","Harmony and Distress: Humor, Culture, and Psychological Well-Being in South Korean Organizations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666223,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 24,"Humor is a contextual phenomenon that exists in all societies, although the impact of humor may differ across different cultures. The data for this research was collected using an ethnographic-based approach, incorporating participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Based in three different South Korean organizations, this research offered the opportunity to interact in depth with workers of varying ages, genders, hierarchical levels, and organizational roles. Humor styles incorporate both light and dark forms of humor that may be affiliative and self-enhancing or aggressive and detrimental or may contain elements from both styles simultaneously Observations were complimented by 46 in-depth interviews and ad hoc follow-up discussions. This paper adopts a Confucian perspective to understand the perception and use of workplace humor in these South Korean organizations. Confucian philosophy emphasizes the value of formality within society in order to maintain respectful relationships between individuals. We suggest that humor is used in these South Korean workplaces to support traditional Confucian values of harmony and hierarchy, and the changing cultural values in these workplaces influence humor perceptions in complex ways. The Confucian value of harmony maintained through the idea of hierarchy creates pressure for organizational members, to accept and cope with contentious humor in the workplace. In particular, the clash between the need to maintain harmonious relationships in the workplace (through obedience toward superiors) and the desire to reject some types of humor highlights issues for younger organizational members. Internal conflict creates distress for younger employees who may hold more Westernized values and this affects their emotional, psychological well-being. This study presents a cross-cultural perspective to organizational humor, and suggests that humor may not always be a positive experience for organizational members, but instead may create psychological distress in some employees.",Better Together: Reliable Application of the Post-9/11 and Post-Iraq US Intelligence Tradecraft Standards Requires Collective Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666222,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 24,"Background: The events of 9/11 and the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction precipitated fundamental changes within the United States Intelligence Community. As part of the reform, analytic tradecraft standards were revised and codified into a policy document - Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 - and an analytic ombudsman was appointed in the newly created Office for the Director of National Intelligence to ensure compliance across the intelligence community. In this paper we investigate the untested assumption that the ICD203 criteria can facilitate reliable evaluations of analytic products. Methods: Fifteen independent raters used a rubric based on the ICD203 criteria to assess the quality of reasoning of 64 analytical reports generated in response to hypothetical intelligence problems. We calculated the intra-class correlation coefficients for single and group-aggregated assessments. Results: Despite general training and rater calibration, the reliability of individual assessments was poor. However, aggregate ratings showed good to excellent reliability. Conclusion: Given that real problems will be more difficult and complex than our hypothetical case studies, we advise that groups of at least three raters are required to obtain reliable quality control procedures for intelligence products. Our study sets limits on assessment reliability and provides a basis for further evaluation of the predictive validity of intelligence reports generated in compliance with the tradecraft standards.",Fostering Children and Adolescents' Creative Thinking in Education. Theoretical Model of Drama Pedagogy Training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666221,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 24,"Drama Pedagogy Training (DPT), as other drama-based pedagogies, has been related to several outcomes, including creativity enhancement. This enhancement is commonly proven through the measurement of different creative processes. In our review we systematize characteristics, activities and techniques of DPT that are assumed to be related to creativity in order to have a more comprehensive framework to identify the specific DPT elements that are involved in the enhancement of some of the creative processes of children and adolescents. To this end, we identified five creative processes in experimental studies using DPT: divergent thinking, fantasy and imagination, associative thinking, symbolization, and problem solving. These processes were cross referenced with DPT characteristics, activities, and techniques that were argued to be related to creativity enhancement. Our review will propose a model with two main categories and six elements as follows: (1) technical drama phases which emphasizes the role of narrative and embodiment through (a) corporal and vocal training and (b) main drama techniques (e.g., storytelling and improvisation and role-play), and (2) psycho-pedagogical framework which emphasizes the role of a dialogic space through (c) playfulness and a (d) collaborative, safe space. We also identified (e) feedback as an important element of DPT which belongs to both drama technical phases and psycho-pedagogical framework categories. Along with the model, we explain the creative outcomes associated to each of these elements as a means to attire the attention to drama-based pedagogies for the development of creativity in the educational setting.",Analyzing Visual Metaphor and Metonymy to Understand Creativity in Fashion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666220,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 24,"The role of figurative language such as metaphor and metonymy in creativity has been studied in cognitive linguistics. These methods can also be applied to analyze non-linguistic data such as pictures and gestures. In this paper, we analyze fashion design by focusing on visual metaphor and metonymy. The nature of creativity in fashion design has not been fully studied from a cognitive perspective compared to other related fields such as art. We especially focus on fashion design as a communication tool between the designer and audience in conveying a designer's image of human beings. Photos from two fashion shows were analyzed. We carried out an experiment to compare how human images in two shows are interpreted by those who are familiar with fashion and those who are not. We obtained three results: (1) As far as figurative (metaphorical and metonymic) interpretations of human images are concerned, two groups with different levels of familiarity with fashion had significantly different patterns of responses to two shows. (2) For the non-figurative interpretations (such as physical or personal attributes), no significant difference in the pattern of response to the show was observed between the two groups. However, the participants as a whole responded to the two shows differently. (3) In addition, for the non-figurative interpretations, the fashion experts found significantly more attributes in human images than the other group. The results show that the analysis of figurative interpretations is effective in understanding how familiarity with fashion affects the mode of seeing fashion shows.",Defective Tool Embodiment in Body Representation of Individuals Affected by Parkinson's Disease: A Preliminary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666219,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 24,"When efficiently used for action, tools become part of the body, with effect on the spatial-temporal movement parameters and body size perception. Until now, no previous investigation has been reported about tool embodiment in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a neurological disease characterized by several sensory and motor symptoms affecting body and action. We enrolled 14 individuals affected by PD and 18 healthy individuals as controls. We studied the spatial-temporal parameters on self-paced free pointing movement task, via an optoelectronic system, before and after a short training in which a 27-cm long rod was used to point toward a far target. Moreover, we investigated changes in estimation of arm length through the Tactile Estimation Task. After the tool-use training, controls showed changes in spatial-temporal parameters: they were slower to perform movements and reported a higher value of deceleration than the baseline. However, such a difference did not emerge in the PD individuals. In the Tactile Discrimination Task, no difference emerged before and after the tool-use training in both groups. Our results were suggestive of possible difficulties of the tool embodiment process in PD. We discussed our results in relation to aberrant multisensory integration as well as in terms of the effect of PD sensory and motor symptoms on body schema plasticity. The present study points at a novel way to conceive PD sensory motor signs and symptoms in terms of their effect on individuals' body representation.",Leptin Increases Expression of 5-HT2B Receptors in Astrocytes Thus Enhancing Action of Fluoxetine on the Depressive Behavior Induced by Sleep Deprivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666218,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 01 24,"The long-lasting loss of sleep is a generally acknowledged risk factor for the occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD), whereas sleep abnormalities being a key clinic symptom of the MDD. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the sleep deprivation (SD) stimulates activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes as well as the release of IL-1β and IL-18 from astrocytes. However, the underlying mechanism connecting SD and MDD still requires further study. Apart of the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, SD affects production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) while release of BDNF from astrocytes appears a key contributor to mood disorders. If and how the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome following SD affects the level of BDNF remains unknown. Antidepressant fluoxetine acts through astroglial 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT2B); these receptors are also related to the sleep-wake cycle. Contribution of leptin to MDD has been discovered recently, although the mechanistic links between leptin and the depressive-like behaviors has not been revealed. In this study, we discovered: (i) that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in the depressive-like behaviors induced by SD; (ii) decrease in BDNF following SD required the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes; (iii) leptin augmented the anti-depressive action of fluoxetine through an increase in expression of astrocytic 5-HT2B receptors. We suggest that decrease in BDNF by the activated NLRP3 inflammasomes in astrocytes is the key pathological event of the depressive-like behaviors induced by SD, while the combined treatment with fluoxetine and leptin improves therapeutic outcome for the depression induced by SD.",Cellular Mechanism Underlying Hydrogen Sulfide Mediated Epithelial K+ Secretion in Rat Epididymis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666217,Frontiers in physiology,2019 01 24,"As a novel gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) elicits various physiological actions including smooth muscle relaxation and promotion of transepithelial ion transport. However, the pro-secretory function of H2S in the male reproductive system remains largely unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the possible roles of H2S in modulating rat epididymal intraluminal ionic microenvironment essential for sperm storage. The results revealed that endogenous H2S-generating enzymes cystathionine β-synthetase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) were both expressed in rat epididymis. CBS located predominantly in epithelial cells whilst CSE expressed primarily in smooth muscle cells. The relative expression level of CBS and CSE escalated from caput to cauda regions of epididymis, which was paralleled to the progressively increasing production of endogenous H2S. The effect of H2S on epididymal epithelial ion transportation was investigated using short-circuit current (ISC), measurement of intracellular ion concentration and in vivo rat epididymal microperfusion. Our data showed that H2S induced transepithelial K+ secretion via adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel and large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel-mediated Ca2+ influx was implicated in the activation of BKCa channel. In vivo studies further demonstrated that H2S promoted K+ secretion in rat epididymal epithelium. Inhibition of endogenous H2S synthesis caused a significant decrease in K+ concentration of cauda epididymal intraluminal fluid. Moreover, our data demonstrated that high extracellular K+ concentration actively depressed the motility of cauda epididymal sperm in a pH-independent manner. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that H2S was vital to the formation of high K+ concentration in epididymal intraluminal fluid by promoting the transepithelial K+ secretion, which might contribute to the maintenance of the cauda epididymal sperm in quiescent dormant state before ejaculation.",Exercise and Omentin: Their Role in the Crosstalk Between Muscle and Adipose Tissues in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Rat Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666216,Frontiers in physiology,2019 01 24,"This study aims to analyze the effects of resisted, aerobic, and combined exercises on omentin levels in visceral adipose tissue and muscle of rats with experimental diabetes to verify whether these adipokines are related to the glucose pathway and inflammation process in this model. Male Wistar rats received a high-fat diet for 4 weeks and a low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) to induce experimental diabetes. After inducing diabetes, the animals were divided into 4 experimental groups (n = 10): diabetic control (C); resistance training (RT); aerobic training (AT); and combined training (CT). The groups were exercised for 12 weeks, 3 times/week, where: RT means the stair climbing protocol until exhaustion; AT is the 30 min/day reaching 20 m/min protocol, and CT is the combination of RT and AT. The AT group showed reduced retroperitoneal and mesenteric adipose tissue and abdominal fat deposits. Our study also showed a possible control of blood glucose, as well as decreased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein, increased circulating adiponectin and increased omentin in visceral adipose tissue. In addition, the AT group affected the glucose pathway by stimulating phosphorylation of Akt in muscle tissue. Omentin also showed a strong positive correlation with adiponectin and a moderate negative correlation with IL-6. Thus, our findings indicated that omentin in type 2 diabetes is changed by AT. Furthermore, increased omentin levels had a close association with the glucose pathway by stimulating phosphorylation of Akt in muscle tissue and with IL-6 in serum, suggesting that omentin is likely to have anti-inflammatory and protective action in experimental diabetes."

However, the safety of hypnotics use in OSA patients is unclear. We conducted a retrospective case-control study to investigate the risk of adverse respiratory events in hypnotics-using OSA patients. Methods: We obtained data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database from 1996 to 2013. The case group included 216 OSA patients with newly diagnosed adverse respiratory events, including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The control group included OSA patients without adverse respiratory events, which was randomly frequency-matched to the case group at a 1:1 ratio according to age, gender, and index year. Hypnotics exposure included benzodiazepines (BZD) and non-benzodiazepines (non-BZD). A recent user was defined as a patient who had taken hypnotics for 1-30 days, while a long-term user was one who had taken hypnotics for 31-365 days. Results: Multivariable adjusted analysis showed recent BZD use is an independent risk for adverse respiratory events (OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.15-6.33; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed both recent and long-term BZD use increased the risk of acute respiratory failure compared to never BZD use (OR = 28.6; 95% CI = 5.24-156; P < 0.001, OR = 10.1; 95% CI = 1.51-67.7; P < 0.05, respectively). Neither BZD nor non-BZD use increased the risk of pneumonia in OSA patients. Conclusion: BZD use might increase the risk of acute respiratory failure in OSA patients.","Standard-Dose Proton Pump Inhibitors in the Initial Non-eradication Treatment of Duodenal Ulcer: Systematic Review, Network Meta-Analysis, and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666204,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Background: Short-term use of standard-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is the first-line initial non-eradication treatment for duodenal ulcer (DU), but the choice on individual PPI drug is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of standard-dose PPI medications in the initial non-eradication treatment of DU. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP database, and the Wanfang database from their earliest records to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating omeprazole (20 mg/day), pantoprazole (40 mg/day), lansoprazole (30 mg/day), rabeprazole (20 mg/day), ilaprazole (10 mg/day), ranitidine (300 mg/day), famotidine (40 mg/day), or placebo for DU were included. The outcomes were 4-week ulcer healing rate (4-UHR) and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). A network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian random effects model was conducted, and a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree was performed from the payer's perspective over 1 year. Results: A total of 62 RCTs involving 10,339 participants (eight interventions) were included. The NMA showed that all the PPIs significantly increased the 4-UHR compared to H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) and placebo, while there was no significant difference for 4-UHR among PPIs. As to the incidence of AEs, no significant difference was observed among PPIs, H2RA, and placebo during 4-week follow-up. Based on the costs of both PPIs and management of AEs in China, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year (in US dollars) for pantoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and ilaprazole compared to omeprazole corresponded to $5134.67, $17801.67, $25488.31, and $44572.22, respectively. Conclusion: Although the efficacy and tolerance of different PPIs are similar in the initial non-eradication treatment of DU, pantoprazole (40 mg/day) seems to be the most cost-effective option in China.",Puerarin Relieves Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathic Pain: The Role of Nav1.8 β1 Subunit of Sensory Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666203,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Currently there is no effective treatment available for clinical patients suffering from neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapy paclitaxel. Puerarin is a major isoflavonoid extracted from the Chinese medical herb kudzu root, which has been used for treatment of cardiovascular disorders and brain injury. Here, we found that puerarin dose-dependently alleviated paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. At the same time, puerarin preferentially reduced the excitability and blocked the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain rats. Furthermore, puerarin was a more potent blocker of tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Nav channels than of tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) Nav channels in chronic pain rats' DRG neurons. In addition, puerarin had a stronger blocking effect on Nav1.8 channels in DRG neurons of neuropathic pain rats and β1 subunit siRNA can abolish this selective blocking effect on Nav1.8. Together, these results suggested that puerarin may preferentially block β1 subunit of Nav1.8 in sensory neurons contributed to its anti-paclitaxel induced neuropathic pain effect.",Regulatory Roles of Sortilin and SorLA in Immune-Related Processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666202,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Sortilin, also known as Neurotensin Receptor-3, and the sorting-related receptor with type-A repeats (SorLA) are both members of the Vps10p domain receptor family. Initially identified in CNS cells, they are expressed in various other cell types where they exert multiple functions. Although mostly studied for its involvement in Alzheimer's disease, SorLA has recently been shown to be implicated in immune response by regulating IL-6-mediated signaling, as well as driving monocyte migration. Sortilin has been shown to act as a receptor, as a co-receptor and as an intra- and extracellular trafficking regulator. In the last two decades, deregulation of sortilin has been demonstrated to be involved in many human pathophysiologies, including neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases), type 2 diabetes and obesity, cancer, and cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis. Several studies highlighted different functions of sortilin in the immune system, notably in microglia, pro-inflammatory cytokine regulation, phagosome fusion and pathogen clearance. In this review, we will analyze the multiple roles of sortilin and SorLA in the human immune system and how their deregulation may be involved in disease development.",The Inhibition of Phosphoinositide-3 Kinases Induce Resolution of Inflammation in a Gout Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666201,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3Ks) are central signaling enzymes that are involved in many aspects of immune cell function. PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ are the major isoforms expressed in leukocytes. The role of PI3K isoforms in the resolution of inflammation is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ to the resolution of inflammation in a model of gout in mice. Methods and Results: Experiments were performed in wild-type male C57/Bl6 mice. Selective inhibitors of PI3K-γ (AS605240) or PI3Kδ (GSK045) were injected in the joint 12 h after injection of MSU crystals, hence at the peak of inflammation. Inhibition of either PI3K isoform decreased number of neutrophils that migrated in response to the injection of MSU crystals. This was associated with reduction of myeloperoxidase activity and IL-1β levels in periarticular tissues and reduction of histological score. Joint dysfunction, as seen by reduced mechanical hypernociception, was improved by treatment with either inhibitor. The decrease in neutrophil numbers was associated with enhanced apoptosis and efferocytosis of these cells. There was shortening of resolution intervals, suggesting inhibition of either isoform induced the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. Blockade of PI3Kγ or PI3Kδ reduced Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. A pan-PI3K inhibitor (CL27c) reduced inflammation induced by MSU crystals by a magnitude that was similar to that attained by the PI3Kγ or PI3Kδ selective inhibitors alone. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that neutrophils can use PI3Kγ or PI3Kδ to remain in the cavity and blockade of either isoenzyme is sufficient to induce their apoptosis and resolve inflammation in a murine model of gout.","Correlation Between C-MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 Protein Expression and Gene Translocation as Biomarkers in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666200,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"This study investigates the protein expression of C-MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and their relationship with genetic abnormalities. A retrospective study of 42 cases on paraffin-embedded tissue specimens diagnosed with DLBCL was performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The expression of C-MYC, BCL-2, BCL-6 protein, and gene abnormalities in these tissue samples was analyzed. The relationship in genetic abnormalities and Ki-67, Hans classification, gender, and age was also evaluated. It was found that the positive rate of C-MYC expression was 47.6% (20/42), the rate of C-MYC gene abnormality was 26.2% (11/42), in which gene translocation accounted for 23.8% (10/42) and gene amplification 2.4% (1/42); C-MYC protein expression was positively correlated with C-MYC gene translocation (χ2 = 11.813; P = 0.001); C-MYC gene translocation was mainly found in germinal center B cell type (χ2 = 4.029; P = 0.045). The positive rate of BCL-2 protein expression was 85.71% (36/42), the positive rate of translocation was 42.86% (18/42) and the amplification rate was 26.19% (11/42); the overexpression of BCL-2 protein was correlated with the BCL-2 translocation (χ2 = 3.407; P = 0.029). The positive rate of BCL-6 protein expression was 45.24% (19/42), the positive rate of BCL-6 translocation was 14.29% (6/42) and the positive rate of BCL-6 amplification was 7.14% (3/42); the overexpression of BCL-6 protein was significantly correlated with BCL-6 translocation (χ2 = 6.091; P = 0.014). The Ki-67 index was significantly higher in C-MYC translocation cases than in non-C-MYC translocation cases (χ2 = 4.492; P = 0.034). Taken together, our results suggest that the protein expression of C-MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 are positively correlated with their gene translocation. Overexpression of C-MYC, BCL-2, BCL-6 protein suggests the possibility of translocation. Therefore, immunohistochemical detection of C-MYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 are useful in diagnosis and prognosis of DLBCL.",GSK-3 Inhibitors and Tooth Repair: An Ethical Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666199,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Tideglusib®, a GSK-3 inhibitor, was initially tested for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, a recent report has suggested its potential off-label use for the treatment of dental cavities. Even if this effect is not yet confirmed, this off-label use can have significant public/dental health consequences, mainly because of the large number of patients with cavities. The purpose of this mini-review is to perform an ethical analysis of the use of Tideglusib in dentistry. The ethical analysis identified three main areas in which ethical breaches could be significant: 1) respect for the autonomy of the patient, 2) issues raised by horizontal shifts in the translational research process, and 3) the conflict between dental beneficence and general non-maleficence. In conclusion, the use of Tideglusib in dentistry should respect the same strict ethical and regulatory criteria from clinical medicine. A translation of the potential risks should be done only after large-scale, phase-III/IV clinical trials, explicitly designed to test the usefulness of this drug in dental medicine.",High Glucose Concentration Impairs 5-PAHSA Activity by Inhibiting AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Activation and Promoting Nuclear Factor-Kappa-B-Mediated Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666198,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Recently, the endogenous fatty acid palmitic acid-5-hydroxystearic acid (5-PAHSA) was found to increase insulin sensitivity and have anti-inflammatory effects in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes. However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty acid synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose concentrations impaired 5-PAHSA action by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway and promoting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) mediated inflammation.",Risk of Heart Failure Hospitalization Associated With Cilostazol in Diabetes: A Nationwide Case-Crossover Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666197,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Background and Objective: It has been suggested to avoid cilostazol, the first-line therapy for peripheral arterial disease, in patients with congestive heart failure (HF). The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) associated with cilostazol use in the patients of diabetes mellitus. Methods: This case-crossover study retrieved records on diabetic patients > 20 years of age who were hospitalized for heart failure during the period of 2009-2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. The ""current"" period was defined as 1-30 days prior to HHF whereas the 91-120 days prior to HHF served as the ""reference"" period. The exposure status just preceding the event is compared with exposure of the same person in one or more referent remote to the event. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate time-varying discordant exposure by the ratio of the number exposed to cilostazol only during the case period to the number exposed to cilostazol only during the control period. Results: A total of 47,506 diabetic patients were included in the analysis (average age: 72.7 ± 12.4, percentage of males: 48%). A total of 399 patients (0.84%) received cilostazol only in the current period, and 252 (0.53%) received cilostazol only in the reference period. After adjustment for other medications, a significant association was found between cilostazol and HHF (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.14-1.59). After further adjustment for time-varying co-morbidities the ORs remained essentially the same. Sensitivity analyses using different definitions of control period (ranging from 31-60, 61-90, to 121-150 days before index date) yielded adjusted ORs of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.14-1.79), 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09-1.57) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.06-1.44), respectively suggesting the robustness of our study findings. Conclusion: Use of cilostazol may be positively related to the risk of HHF. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and to confirm the association.","Digoxin, an Overlooked Agonist of RORγ/RORγT.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666196,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 01 24,"Digoxin was one of the first identified RORγT receptor inverse agonists inhibiting the differentiation of Th17 cells. However, this compound exhibits inhibitory activity at relatively high concentrations that mediate cytotoxic effects. We previously identified several cardenolides that are structurally similar to digoxin that were able to induce RORγ/RORγT-dependent transcription. These observations encouraged us to reanalyze the effects of digoxin on RORγ/RORγT-dependent transcription at low, noncytotoxic concentrations. Digoxin induced RORγ/RORγT-dependent transcription in HepG2 and Th17 cells. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptomes of Th17 cells cultured in the presence of digoxin revealed the induction of the expression of numerous Th17-specific genes, including IL17A/F, IL21, IL22, IL23R, CCR4, and CCR6. Thus, our study, which includes data obtained from intact cells, indicates that digoxin, similar to other cardenolides, is a potent RORγ/RORγT receptor activator and that its structure may serve as a starting point for the design of dedicated molecules that can be used in the development of adoptive cell therapy (ACT)."

Moderate levels of hyperexcitability can lead to mild alterations of the EEG and are often associated with cognitive deficits even in the absence of overt seizures. Indeed, various testing paradigms have shown degraded performances in presence of acute or chronic non-ictal epileptiform activity. Evidences from both animal models and the clinics suggest that anomalous activity can cause cognitive deficits by transiently disrupting cortical processing, independently from the underlying etiology of the disease. Here, we will review our understanding of the influence of an abnormal EEG activity on brain computation in the context of the available clinical data and in genetic or pharmacological animal models.",Deep Learning Based Attenuation Correction of PET/MRI in Pediatric Brain Tumor Patients: Evaluation in a Clinical Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666184,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 01 24,"Aim: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a useful tool for assisting in correct differentiation of tumor progression from reactive changes. O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET in combination with MRI can add valuable information for clinical decision making. Acquiring FET-PET/MRI simultaneously allows for a one-stop-shop that limits the need for a second sedation or anesthesia as with PET and MRI in sequence. PET/MRI is challenged by lack of a direct measure of photon attenuation. Accepted solutions for attenuation correction (AC) might not be applicable to pediatrics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the subject-specific MR-derived AC method RESOLUTE, modified to a pediatric cohort, against the performance of an MR-AC technique based on deep learning in a pediatric brain tumor cohort. Methods: The modifications to RESOLUTE and the implementation of a deep learning method were performed using 79 pediatric patient examinations. We analyzed the 36 of these with active brain tumor area above 1 mL. We measured background (B), tumor mean and maximal activity (TMEAN, TMAX), biological tumor volume (BTV), and calculated the clinical metrics TMEAN/B and TMAX/B. Results: Overall, we found both RESOLUTE and our DeepUTE methodologies to accurately reproduce the CT-AC clinical metrics. Regardless of age, both methods were able to obtain AC maps similar to the CT-AC, albeit with DeepUTE producing the most similar based on both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. In the patient-by-patient analysis DeepUTE was the only technique with all patients inside the predefined acceptable clinical limits. It also had a higher precision with relative %-difference to the reference CT-AC (TMAX/B mean: -0.1%, CI: [-0.8%, 0.5%], p = 0.54) compared to RESOLUTE (TMAX/B mean: 0.3%, CI: [-0.6%, 1.2%], p = 0.67) and DIXON-AC (TMAX/B mean: 5.9%, CI: [4.5%, 7.4%], p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Overall, we found DeepUTE to be the AC method that most robustly reproduced the CT-AC clinical metrics per se, closely followed by RESOLUTE modified to pediatric cohorts. The added accuracy due to better noise handling of DeepUTE, ease of use, as well as the improved runtime makes DeepUTE the method of choice for PET/MRI attenuation correction.",Gestational Exposure to Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) Leads to Spatial Memory Dysfunction and Neurodevelopmental Impairment in Hippocampus of Mice Offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666183,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 01 24,"Prenatal exposure to air pollutants has long-term impact on growth retardation of nervous system development and is related to central nervous system diseases in children. However, it is not well-characterized whether gestational exposure to air pollutants affects the development of nervous system in offspring. Here, we investigated the effects of gestational exposure to particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) on hippocampus development in mice offspring, through neurobehavioral, ultrastructural, biochemical and molecular investigations. We found that spatial memory in mice offspring from PM2.5 high-dosage group was impaired. Next, hippocampal ultrastructure of the mice offspring in puberty exhibited mitochondrial damage related to PM2.5 exposure. Interestingly, EdU-positive cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of offspring from PM2.5 high-dosage group decreased, with NeuN+/EdU+cells reduced significantly. Furthermore, the numbers of NeuN+/TUNEL+, GFAP+/TUNEL+, and Iba1+/TUNEL+ double-labeled cells increased with PM2.5 exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. In addition, gestational exposure to PM2.5 resulted in increased levels of both mRNAs and proteins involved in apoptosis, including caspase-3, -8, -9, p53, and c-Fos, and decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratios in the hippocampus of mice offspring. Moreover, gestational exposure to PM2.5 was dosage-dependently associated with the increased secretions of inflammatory proteins, including NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Collectively, our results suggest that gestational exposure to PM2.5 leads to spatial memory dysfunction and neurodevelopmental impairment by exerting effects on apoptotic and neuroinflammatory events, as well as the neurogenesis in hippocampus of mice offspring.",Examining the Interactions Between Expectations and tDCS Effects on Motor and Cognitive Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666182,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 01 24,"Background: Despite a growing literature and commercial market, the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remains questionable. Notably, studies rarely examine factors such as expectations of outcomes, which may influence tDCS response through placebo-like effects. Here we sought to determine whether expectations could influence the behavioral outcomes of a tDCS intervention. Methods: Through an initial study and self-replication, we recruited 121 naïve young adults 18-34 years of age (M = 21.14, SD = 3.58; 88 women). We evaluated expectations of tDCS and of motor and cognitive performance at three times: (i) at baseline; (ii) after being primed to have High or Low expectations of outcomes; and (iii) after a single session of sham-controlled anodal tDCS over the left or right motor cortex. Before and after stimulation, participants performed the Grooved Pegboard Test and a choice reaction time task as measures of motor dexterity, response time, and response inhibition. Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that participants had varying, largely uncertain, expectations regarding tDCS effectiveness at baseline. Expectation ratings significantly increased or decreased in response to High or Low priming, respectively, and decreased following the intervention. Response times and accuracy on motor and cognitive measures were largely unaffected by expectation or stimulation conditions. Overall, our analysis revealed no effect attributable to baseline expectations, belief of group assignment, or experimental condition on behavioral outcomes. Subjective experience did not differ based on expectation or stimulation condition. Conclusions: Our results suggest no clear effects of tDCS or of expectations on our performance measures, highlighting the need for further investigations of such stimulation methods.",Dynamic Alterations in Spontaneous Neural Activity in Multiple Brain Networks in Subacute Stroke Patients: A Resting-State fMRI Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666181,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 01 24,"Objective: To examine whether subacute stroke patients would exhibit abnormal dynamic characteristics of brain activity relative to healthy controls (HC) and to investigate whether the altered dynamic regional indexes were associated with clinical behavior in stroke patients. Methods: The dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) and dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo) in 42 subacute stroke patients and 55 healthy controls were compared. Correlation analyses between dALFF and dReHo in regions showing significant intergroup differences and clinical scores (i.e., the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment and lesion volume size) were conducted in stroke patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the potential value of altered dynamic regional indexes to identify stroke patients. Results: Significantly dALFF in the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL), ipsilesional superior parietal lobe, ipsilesional inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), the midline supplementary motor area (SMA), ipsilesional putamen and lentiform nucleus were detected in stroke patients compared to HC. Relative to the HC group, the stroke patients showed significant differences in dReHo in the contralesional rectal gyrus, contralesional ITG, contralesional pons, ipsilesional middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Significant correlations between dALFF variability in midline SMA and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scores or between dReHo variability in the ipsilesional MFG and FMA scores were detected in stroke patients. Furthermore, the ROC curve revealed that dynamic ALFF at SMA and ReHo at ipsilesional MFG might have the potential to distinguish stroke patients. Conclusion: The pattern of intrinsic brain activity variability is altered in stroke patients compared with HC, and dynamic ALFF/ReHo might be potential tools to assess stroke patients' motor function.",Inhibition of Necroptosis Rescues SAH-Induced Synaptic Impairments in Hippocampus via CREB-BDNF Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666179,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 01 24,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating form of stroke that leads to incurable outcomes. Increasing evidence has proved that early brain injury (EBI) contributes mostly to unfavorable outcomes after SAH. A previously unknown mechanism of regulated cell death known as necroptosis has recently been reported. Necrostatin-1 (nec-1), a specific and potent inhibitor of necroptosis, can attenuate brain impairments after SAH. However, the effect of nec-1 on the hippocampus and its neuroprotective impact on synapses after SAH is not well understood. Our present study was designed to investigate the potential effects of nec-1 administration on synapses and its relevant signal pathway in EBI after SAH. Nec-1 was administrated in a rat model via intracerebroventricular injection after SAH. Neurobehavior scores and brain edema were detected at 24 h after SAH occurred. The expression of the receptor-interacting proteins 1 and 3 (RIP1and3) was examined as a marker of necroptosis. We used hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, silver staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) to observe the morphological changes in hippocampus. The protective effect of nec-1 on synapses was evaluated using western blotting and electron microscopy and Western blotting was used to detect the cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and we used transmission electron microscopy and TUNEL to detect the protective effects of nec-1 when a specific inhibitor of CREB, known as 666-15, was used. Our results showed that in the SAH group, RIP1, and RIP3 significantly increased in the hippocampus. Additionally, injection of nec-1 alleviated brain edema and improved neurobehavior scores, compared with those in the SAH group. The damage to neurons was attenuated, and synaptic structure also improved in the Sham+nec-1 group. Furthermore, nec-1 treatment significantly enhanced the levels of phospho-CREB and BDNF compared with those in the SAH group. The protective effect of nec-1 could hindered by 666-15. Thus, nec-1 mitigated SAH-induced synaptic impairments in the hippocampus through the inhibition of necroptosis in connection with the CREB-BDNF pathway. This study may provide a new strategy for SAH patients in clinical practice.","When Watching Video, Many Saccades Are Curved and Deviate From a Velocity Profile Model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666178,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 01 25,"Commonly, saccades are thought to be ballistic eye movements, not modified during flight, with a straight path and a well-described velocity profile. However, they do not always follow a straight path and studies of saccade curvature have been reported previously. In a prior study, we developed a real-time, saccade-trajectory prediction algorithm to improve the updating of gaze-contingent displays and found that saccades with a curved path or that deviated from the expected velocity profile were not well fit by our saccade-prediction algorithm (velocity-profile deviation), and thus had larger updating errors than saccades that had a straight path and had a velocity profile that was fit well by the model. Further, we noticed that the curved saccades and saccades with high velocity-profile deviations were more common than we had expected when participants performed a natural-viewing task. Since those saccades caused larger display updating errors, we sought a better understanding of them. Here we examine factors that could affect curvature and velocity profile of saccades using a pool of 218,744 saccades from 71 participants watching ""Hollywood"" video clips. Those factors included characteristics of the participants (e.g., age), of the videos (importance of faces for following the story, genre), of the saccade (e.g., magnitude, direction), time during the session (e.g., fatigue) and presence and timing of scene cuts. While viewing the video clips, saccades were most likely horizontal or vertical over oblique. Measured curvature and velocity-profile deviation had continuous, skewed frequency distributions. We used mixed-effects regression models that included cubic terms and found a complex relationship between curvature, velocity-profile deviation and saccade duration (or magnitude). Curvature and velocity-profile deviation were related to some video-dependent features such as lighting, face presence, or nature and human figure content. Time during the session was a predictor for velocity profile deviations. Further, we found a relationship for saccades that were in flight at the time of a scene cut to have higher velocity-profile deviations and lower curvature in univariable models. Saccades characteristics vary with a variety of factors, which suggests complex interactions between oculomotor control and scene content that could be explored further.",An Adaptive Averaging Low Noise Front-End for Central and Peripheral Nerve Recording.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666177,"IEEE transactions on circuits and systems.

 ) topology to effectively increase the noise efficiency factor (NEF) without chopping or use of a costly BiCMOS process. It addresses a disadvantage of the doubled-g
m
 technique by a high input impedance DC-coupled LNA and saves on-chip space for higher density by eliminating AC-coupling capacitors. The proposed technique is particularly suitable for ultra-low noise multichannel recording from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) with channel selection analog multiplexer, where input signal is in tens of μV. A 32-ch proof-of-concept-prototype AFE was fabricated in a 5M2P 130-nm standard CMOS process, occupying 2.4 × 2.5 mm2 together with its control block. The prototype LNA consumes 11 μW from a 1 V supply, providing 3.0 μVrms input referred noise with 61 ΜΩ input impedance, which are desirable for high SNR, to be further improved by the adaptive averaging technique.","Understanding and overcoming trade-offs between antibody affinity, specificity, stability and solubility.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666176,Biochemical engineering journal,2019 01 24,"The widespread use of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic applications has led to intense interest in optimizing several of their natural properties (affinity, specificity, stability, solubility and effector functions) as well as introducing non-natural activities (bispecificity and cytotoxicity mediated by conjugated drugs). A common challenge during antibody optimization is that improvements in one property (e.g., affinity) can lead to deficits in other properties (e.g., stability). Here we review recent advances in understanding trade-offs between different antibody properties, including affinity, specificity, stability and solubility. We also review new approaches for co-optimizing multiple antibody properties and discuss how these methods can be used to rapidly and systematically generate antibodies for a wide range of applications.",Low-fluoroscopy atrial fibrillation ablation with contact force and ultrasound technologies: a learning curve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666175,Pragmatic and observational research,2019 01 24,Fluoroscopy exposure during catheter ablation is a health hazard to patients and operators.

However, the measurement of placement stability and the reasons children move are complex issues that warrant considerable attention. In this study, we used a two-year Texas foster care entry cohort to examine the extent to which children experience ""progress moves"", such as moving to a sibling placement or to live with a relative, versus non-progress moves, such as moving due to risk of abuse. Our sample consisted of 23,760 children and 66,585 placements statewide. Using two methods of classifying moves as either progress or non-progress, we found, of placements that ended with a move to a new placement, 29-43% ended with progress moves, and 57-71% ended with non-progress moves. Classification of move types was consistent across methods overall, but far less when the pre-move placement was in a shelter or restrictive setting. Additional analyses showed that the prevalence and risk factors for adverse moves varied across placement setting. Implications for the measurement and improvement of placement stability are discussed.",Symbiont-derived sphingolipids regulate inflammatory responses in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666068,"Aquaculture (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 01 24,"Farmed fish live in association with diverse bacterial communities that produce wide arrays of metabolites. In rainbow trout, the skin and the gills are colonized by Flectobacillus major, a bacterium known to produce sphingolipids (SLs). The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of F. major SLs to regulate rainbow trout inflammatory responses. F. major SLs were delivered by themselves or in combination with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA), an oil-based adjuvant known to cause severe abdominal inflammation when injected to fish. Trout injected with SL + FCA showed decreased severity of FCA toxic effects including necrosis, granuloma formation and presence of oil droplets. However, inclusion of SLs in the FCA preparation did not decrease infiltration of immune cells intramuscularly at the site of injection. Intraperitoneal or intravenous delivery of F. major SLs resulted in increased expression of IgT, IgM and TGFβ transcripts in the gills but not the head-kidney and had no effects on IL-10 expression. These results indicate the F. major SLs regulate rainbow trout inflammatory responses and indicate that this compound can have important applications in farmed fish health management.",Oral Manifestation as the Main Sign of an Advanced Stage Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666067,Acta stomatologica Croatica,2019 01 24,"Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive malignant neoplasm occurring mainly in elderly, with the median age of 65 years. Oral manifestations, mainly spontaneous bleeding, are a common finding in acute myelocytic leukemia and may represent the initial evidence of the disease. This report describes a case of a 47-year-old man with a one-month history of spontaneous oral bleeding. The patient had already been consulted by two professionals but he remained undiagnosed. The physical examination revealed paleness, fever, epistaxis and ecchymoses in the oral mucosa. The complete blood count revealed anemia, severe thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis with blasts predominance, reinforcing the diagnosis hypothesis of an acute leukemia. The patient was immediately referred to the Hospital and despite having received a quick intervention, he died 3 days after the admission due to diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. According to the peripheral blood immunophenotyping the diagnosis of hypogranular variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established. The delay in the diagnosis may have influenced the unfavorable outcome. Early diagnosis and management are indispensable for survival of leukemia patients. In this way, dentists may be responsible for an early detection of oral manifestations of leukemia and for a fast referral to an adequate professional.",The First Fifty Years of Acta Stomatologica Croatica (1966 - 2016): Citation Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666066,Acta stomatologica Croatica,2019 01 22,"Acta Stomatologica Croatica (ASCRO) citation analysis was made on the occasion of fifty years of publishing the journal (1966 to 2016). The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the changes that have been occurring over the last ten years on the visibility and citation of ASCRO by comparing the obtained results with the 2008 ASCRO citation analysis.

Physical properties can be improved by using external energy such as ultrasound and radiant heat (thermo-curing), which also accelerates chemical curing. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the most effective polishing technique and to compare the surface roughness of two Glass Ionomer Cements after treatment with heat (thermo-curing), and without heat treatment during the setting process. Materials and methods: Two polishing systems (Tungsten carbide burs and Sof-Lex discs) were used on two types of GIC (Equia Fil and Ketac Molar Universal). Bluephase 16i LED (Vivadent, Schaan Liechtenstein) light was used for the specimens treated with heat (thermo-curing). Samples without heat treatment are left for 10 minutes to chemically cure. Surface profilometar was used for measuring the mean surface roughness value (Ra). Results: Group with Mylar strip (control group) of each material showed the lowest (Ra) value. The Equia Fil material samples treated with heat (thermo-curing) achieved lower surface roughness values (Ra), and showed lower surface roughness values (Ra) after polishing with a Sof-Lex discs (p<0.05). The results for Ketac Molar Universal samples showed no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between polishing with Sof-Lex discs and Tungsten carbide burs. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the smoothest surface roughness is achieved by the Mylar strip.

A clear understanding of genetic factors is important, as it is known that angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism affects muscle mass, although the findings are frequently heterogeneous. This study was conducted to determine the association between ACE I/D polymorphism and muscle mass in elderly people. A total of 130 elderly people were recruited from nursing homes in Jakarta. Anthropometric components affecting the muscle mass were examined. Cross-sectional analyses were performed to compare data using t-test, ANOVA and ANCOVA, and linear regression. Genotyping of the ACE I/D polymorphisms was performed by PCR methods, and muscle mass was evaluated by BIA. Genotype distribution counts II 65.38%, ID 13.85%, and DD 20.77% were not consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ² = 22.2, df = 2; p < 0.01). Individuals with the DD genotype showed lower muscle mass that was significantly different compared to the muscle mass in individuals with the II/ID genotype (II 16.14 ± 0.38, ID 15.71 ± 0.59; DD 13.95 ± 0.61 kg), after adjusting for % fat as a covariate. The linear regression analysis showed that age, gender, weight, height, nutritional status, protein content, and waist, hip, and calf circumference were significant contributors to muscle mass. In the multivariate analysis, adjusted age and gender significantly correlated with muscle mass, with r² = 0.98, by the likelihood ratio test (p < 0.01). The genotype variability accounted for 2.65% of the DD genotype. This study showed that in an elderly population in Jakarta, the DD genotype was associated with low muscle mass. This result suggests the role of nutritional status as a potential mediator in the association between ACE gene and muscle mass.",Case Series of Comminuted Olecranon Fracture Treated by Plate Fixation; Do We Have to Remove the Plate?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666041,The Kobe journal of medical sciences,2019 05 28,"Comminuted olecranon fracture requires surgical intervention. Plate fixation has been performed on the majority of cases. We reviewed the cases of comminuted olecranon fracture in young and middle age treated by plate osteosynthesis and analyzed the functional outcome, complications and ratio and timing of hardware removal. Fifteen cases of comminuted olecranon fractures treated by plate fixation were reviewed. Bone union was achieved in all cases, the average range of motion at the final follow up was -11° in extension, 133° in flexion, 89° in pronation and 88° in supination. Hardware removal performed in 12 cases in average 8.3 months postoperatively, in 2 cases elbow joint contracture release was performed during the hardware removal. In the co-payment (+) group, 4 cases (67%) removed the plate at average six months postoperatively. On the other hand, no co-payment group (workman's compensation insurance or automobile liability insurance) underwent hardware removal surgery in 8 cases (89%) at 9.6 months postoperatively. There was no statistical difference between the timing or prevalence of hardware removal between the groups. The present study showed high removal rate of hardware despite the excellent clinical result. The surgeons should be aware that plate fixation of the olecranon fracture requires the removal of a plate in the majority of cases.","Reduction of Serum Uric Acid Associated with Attenuation of Renal Injury, Inflammation and Macrophages M1/M2 Ratio in Hyperuricemic Mice Model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666040,The Kobe journal of medical sciences,2019 05 28,"Hyperuricemia contributed to endothelial dysfunction, activation of the RAS system, increased oxidative stress and maladaptive immune system response.

There is only a limited study on vascular remodeling of it. The present study aimed at examining vascular remodeling in hippocampus and spatial memory disturbances after transient brain ischemia. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, i.e. sham operated (SHAM), transient brain ischemia with 1 day reperfusion (IR1), 3 day reperfusion (IR3), and 10 days reperfusion (IR10) groups. Transient brain ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). The spatial memory test was performed using the Morris water maze (MWM) in SHAM and IR10 groups. The rats were euthanized at day 1, 3 or 10 after BCCAO depending on the groups. The mRNA expressions of SOD2, Bcl-2, NeuN, eNOS, endothelin-1 (ET-1), CD31, VE-cadherin and vascular remodeling of the hippocampus were examined. There were deteriorations of spatial learning ability in IR10 group. The percentages of SOD2 and Bcl-2, the expression of NeuN, decreased and the vascular remodeling was observed in the ischemic groups. The eNOS and CD31 expressions were less in IR10, the VE-cadherin expression was less in all ischemic groups than in SHAM group, while ET-1 expression in IR1 group was higher than any other groups. The spatial memory deterioration after BCCAO is associated with vascular remodeling in hippocampus, characterized by lumen narrowing and smooth muscle thickening of microvessels.",Potential of Coffee Fruit Extract and Quinic Acid on Adipogenesis and Lipolysis in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666038,The Kobe journal of medical sciences,2019 05 28,"This study was to assess the impact of different colors of coffee fruit (green, yellow and red) on adipogenesis and/or lipolysis using 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

While the cutting-edge research in the field has identified many molecular, functional, and structural abnormalities, the exact molecular mechanism of this devastating disease remains obscure. Diabetic environment drives dysfunction of the power generator of the cell and disturbs the homeostasis of mitochondrial dynamic. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is damaged, the transcription of mtDNA-encoded genes is impaired, and the electron transport chain is compromised, fueling into a vicious cycle of free radicals. The hyperglycemic milieu also alters the epigenetic machinery, and mtDNA and other genes associated with mitochondrial homeostasis are epigenetically modified, further contributing to the mitochondrial damage. Thus, mitochondria appear to have a significant role in the development of diabetic retinopathy, and unraveling the mechanism responsible for their damage as well as the role of epigenetic modifications in mitochondrial homeostasis should identify novel therapeutic targets.

This paper examines the legal regulatory model for governing professions as the autonomous exercise of professional skills and asks whether there is a theoretical basis for this model. Taking John Rawls's distinction between the justification of a practice and justification of the rules internal to the practice, this paper argues that the autonomous exercise of professional skills is justified so long as it benefits society. In opposition to Christopher Boorse, it is argued that medicine is pathocentric and that physicians exercise skills in treating pathologies. The autonomous treatment of pathologies is justified because non-interference with physicians will lead to greater treatment of pathologies and so benefit society. Finally, the analysis of medicine as the autonomous exercise of skills in treating pathologies yields the rule that physicians not be forced to cause pathologies.",Leishmaniosis in a dog with no travel history outside of the UK.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665949,The Veterinary record,2019 04 05,"A 3-year-old male neutered Shih Tzu cross was presented for investigation of a three-week history of weight loss, seborrhoea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

We have developed an encapsulated cell technology that overcomes these obstacles by providing a targeted, continuous, de novo synthesized source of high levels of neurotrophic molecules from human clonal ARPE-19 cells encapsulated into hollow fiber membranes. Here we illustrate the potential of this approach for delivering glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) directly to the hippocampus of epileptic rats. In vivo studies demonstrated that bilateral intrahippocampal implants continued to secrete GDNF that produced high hippocampal GDNF tissue levels in a long-term manner. Identical implants robustly reduced seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model. Seizures were reduced rapidly, and this effect increased in magnitude over 3 months, ultimately leading to a reduction of seizures by 93%. This effect persisted even after device removal, suggesting potential disease-modifying benefits. Importantly, seizure reduction was associated with normalized changes in anxiety and improved cognitive performance. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the neurological benefits of GDNF were associated with the normalization of anatomical alterations accompanying chronic epilepsy, including hippocampal atrophy, cell degeneration, loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and abnormal neurogenesis. These effects were associated with the activation of GDNF receptors. All in all, these results support the concept that the implantation of encapsulated GDNF-secreting cells can deliver GDNF in a sustained, targeted, and efficacious manner, paving the way for continuing preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical translation of this approach for epilepsy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting millions of individuals of all ages. These patients experience debilitating seizures that frequently increase over time and can associate with significant cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders that are generally poorly controlled by pharmacotherapy. We have developed a clinically validated, implantable cell encapsulation system that delivers high and consistent levels of GDNF directly to the brain. In epileptic animals, this system produced a progressive and permanent reduction (>90%) in seizure frequency. These benefits were accompanied by improvements in cognitive and anxiolytic behavior and the normalization of changes in CNS anatomy that underlie chronic epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a novel means of tackling the frequently intractable neurological consequences of this devastating disorder.",Repetitive Diffuse Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Causes an Atypical Astrocyte Response and Spontaneous Recurrent Seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665946,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 16,"Focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces astrogliosis, a process essential to protecting uninjured brain areas from secondary damage. However, astrogliosis can cause loss of astrocyte homeostatic functions and possibly contributes to comorbidities such as posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Scar-forming astrocytes seal focal injuries off from healthy brain tissue. It is these glial scars that are associated with epilepsy originating in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, the vast majority of human TBIs also present with diffuse brain injury caused by acceleration-deceleration forces leading to tissue shearing. The resulting diffuse tissue damage may be intrinsically different from focal lesions that would trigger glial scar formation. Here, we used mice of both sexes in a model of repetitive mild/concussive closed-head TBI, which only induced diffuse injury, to test the hypothesis that astrocytes respond uniquely to diffuse TBI and that diffuse TBI is sufficient to cause PTE. Astrocytes did not form scars and classic astrogliosis characterized by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was limited. Surprisingly, an unrelated population of atypical reactive astrocytes was characterized by the lack of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, rapid and sustained downregulation of homeostatic proteins and impaired astrocyte coupling. After a latency period, a subset of mice developed spontaneous recurrent seizures reminiscent of PTE in human TBI patients. Seizing mice had larger areas of atypical astrocytes compared with nonseizing mice, suggesting that these atypical astrocytes might contribute to epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired epilepsies. Reactive astrocytes have long been associated with seizures and epilepsy in patients, particularly after focal/lesional brain injury. However, most TBIs also include nonfocal, diffuse injuries. Here, we showed that repetitive diffuse TBI is sufficient for the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in a subset of mice. We identified an atypical response of astrocytes induced by diffuse TBI characterized by the rapid loss of homeostatic proteins and lack of astrocyte coupling while reactive astrocyte markers or glial scar formation was absent. Areas with atypical astrocytes were larger in animals that later developed seizures suggesting that this response may be one root cause of epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.",The lysine-specific methyltransferase KMT2C/MLL3 regulates DNA repair components in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665945,EMBO reports,2019 03 29,"Genome-wide studies in tumor cells have indicated that chromatin-modifying proteins are commonly mutated in human cancers. The lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C/MLL3) is a putative tumor suppressor in several epithelia and in myeloid cells. Here, we show that downregulation of KMT2C in bladder cancer cells leads to extensive changes in the epigenetic status and the expression of DNA damage response and DNA repair genes. More specifically, cells with low KMT2C activity are deficient in homologous recombination-mediated double-strand break DNA repair. Consequently, these cells suffer from substantially higher endogenous DNA damage and genomic instability. Finally, these cells seem to rely heavily on PARP1/2 for DNA repair, and treatment with the PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib leads to synthetic lethality, suggesting that cancer cells with low KMT2C expression are attractive targets for therapies with PARP1/2 inhibitors.",Splicing factor ESRP1 controls ER-positive breast cancer by altering metabolic pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665944,EMBO reports,2019 02 16,"The epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (ESRP1 and ESRP2) control the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) splicing program in cancer. However, their role in breast cancer recurrence is unclear. In this study, we report that high levels of ESRP1, but not ESRP2, are associated with poor prognosis in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast tumors. Knockdown of ESRP1 in endocrine-resistant breast cancer models decreases growth significantly and alters the EMT splicing signature, which we confirm using TCGA SpliceSeq data of ER+ BRCA tumors. However, these changes are not accompanied by the development of a mesenchymal phenotype or a change in key EMT-transcription factors. In tamoxifen-resistant cells, knockdown of ESRP1 affects lipid metabolism and oxidoreductase processes, resulting in the decreased expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, ESRP1 knockdown increases the basal respiration and spare respiration capacity. This study reports a novel role for ESRP1 that could form the basis for the prevention of tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer.",Visualizing ubiquitination in mammalian cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665942,EMBO reports,2019 02 16,"Covalent modification of proteins with ubiquitin is essential for the majority of biological processes in mammalian cells. Numerous proteins are conjugated with single or multiple ubiquitin molecules or chains in a dynamic fashion, often determining protein half-lives, localization or function. Experimental approaches to study ubiquitination have been dominated by genetic and biochemical analysis of enzyme structure-function relationships, reaction mechanisms and physiological relevance. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in microscopy-based imaging of ubiquitination, available reagents and technologies. We discuss the progress in direct and indirect imaging of differentially linked ubiquitin chains in fixed and living cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy and super-resolution microscopy, illustrated by the role of ubiquitin in antibacterial autophagy and pro-inflammatory signalling. Finally, we speculate on future developments and forecast a transition from qualitative to quantitative super-resolution approaches to understand fundamental aspects of ubiquitination and the formation and distribution of functional E3 ligase protein complexes in their native environment.",Upregulation of Chitinase 1 in Alveolar Macrophages of HIV-Infected Smokers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665939,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 02 22,"Recent studies suggest that HIV infection is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We hypothesized that HIV infection and cigarette smoking synergize to alter the function of alveolar macrophages (AMs). To test this hypothesis, global transcriptome analysis was performed on purified AMs from 20 individuals split evenly between HIV-uninfected nonsmokers and smokers and untreated HIV-infected nonsmokers and smokers. Differential expression analysis identified 143 genes significantly altered by the combination of HIV infection and smoking. Of the differentially expressed genes, chitinase 1 (CHIT1) and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1), both previously associated with COPD, were among the most upregulated genes (5- and 26-fold, respectively) in the untreated HIV-infected smoker cohort compared with HIV-uninfected nonsmokers. Expression of CHIT1 and CYP1B1 correlated with the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization, oxidative stress, immune response, and cell death. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry to characterize AMs, a significantly decreased expression of CD163, an M2 marker, was seen in HIV-infected subjects, and CD163 inversely correlated with CYP1B1 expression in AMs. CHIT1 protein levels were significantly upregulated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from HIV-infected smokers, and increased CHIT1 levels negatively correlated with lung function measurements. Overall, these findings raise the possibility that elevated CHIT1 and CYP1B1 are early indicators of COPD development in HIV-infected smokers that may serve as biomarkers for determining this risk."

In this context, the development of new additional agents is mandatory. Sirtuins, which are class III NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, have been considered important targets for the development of new anti-parasitic drugs. Here, we evaluated the activity of KH-TFMDI, a novel 3-arylideneindolin-2-one-type sirtuin inhibitor, on G. intestinalis trophozoites. This compound decreased the trophozoite growth presenting an IC50 value lower than nicotinamide, a moderately active inhibitor of yeast and human sirtuins. Light and electron microscopy analysis showed the presence of multinucleated cell clusters suggesting that the cytokinesis could be compromised in treated trophozoites. Cell rounding, concomitantly with the folding of the ventro-lateral flange and flagella internalization, was also observed. These cells eventually died by a mechanism which lead to DNA/nuclear damage, formation of multi-lamellar bodies and annexin V binding on the parasite surface. Taken together, these data show that KH-TFMDI has significant effects against G. intestinalis trophozoites proliferation and structural organization and suggest that histone deacetylation pathway should be explored on this protozoon as target for chemotherapy.",Role of Skip Mediastinal Lymph Node Metastasis for Patients With Resectable Non-small-cell Lung Cancer: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665872,Clinical lung cancer,2019 05 19,"N2 disease represents a heterogeneous group of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with varying 5-year overall survival (OS) rates.

Fifth finger amputation, which is sometimes the only solution, has a major negative impact on function and appearance, and exposes the patient to adjacent digital hook aggravation. Middle phalangectomy with finger shortening fusion is an alternative surgical solution. The aim of this study was to report on a continuous series of 36 cases treated with this approach. This was a retrospective series of 33 patients (26 males and 7 females) operated from 1994 to 2015. All patients had severe contracture of their little finger and 30 had prior surgery. The combined extension lag was 143° (75-270), with considerable functional deficit and poor appearance. The surgical technique consisted of a dorsal approach, a more or less extensive excision of the middle phalanx, and arthrodesis with alignment of the remaining bone segments, while preserving the fingertip/nail complex. The following outcomes were determined when the patients were reviewed: functional discomfort and use, appearance, residual pain, pulp sensitivity, recurrence of contracture and overall satisfaction. Six patients were dead and two were lost to follow-up. Twenty-five patients (27 cases) were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 64 months (12-280). There were no post-operative complications. Twenty-two patients (24 cases) were satisfied or very satisfied. The resulting appearance was graded at 7.13/10 (1-10). Pain on a 10-point Visual Analog Scale was 0.46 (0-5). Cold intolerance was found in 9 cases (33.3%) and decreased fingertip sensitivity in 3 cases (11.1%). The hand could be flattened in 21 cases; in the other cases, it could not be flattened due to contracture in another finger. Wearing gloves was again possible in 26 cases. Fusion was achieved in 18 of the 21 cases evaluated with X-rays at the last follow-up (85.7%). All the other cases had a non-union with no clinical repercussions. There were 5 local recurrences at the level of the little finger. Finger shortening through a dorsal approach seems to provide satisfactory outcomes in patients with Dupuytren's disease who have severe contracture of the little finger. This technique results in an acceptable looking functional finger, which has sensation and no significant morbidity.","Ramucirumab after sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and increased α-fetoprotein concentrations (REACH-2): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665869,The Lancet.

We describe the CT appearance of a rare tumor type, odontogenic myxofibroma, in the mandible of a 33-year-old woman, and we focus on the potential applications of CR visualizations in this and similar scenarios. Although prospective data quantifying the advantages of CR relative to traditional methods of 3D visualization are still forthcoming, the photorealistic quality of CR images, nonetheless, suggests the important potential utility of this method. Realistic shadowing effects in the images create depth and show the relative positions of objects within a visualized volume in an advantageous manner. Furthermore, soft tissue details allow for visualization of structures that can otherwise be difficult to render with traditional methods.","Complications, patient-reported outcomes, and aesthetic results in immediate breast reconstruction with a dermal sling: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665838,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",2019 02 17,"An inferior dermal flap (""sling"") can be used to cover an implant with two layers of tissue following Wise pattern skin-reducing mastectomies.

A total of 428 abstracts were retrieved, with 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria and including a total of 879 patients and 1184 reconstructed breasts. The mean complication rate was 21.6% (95% CI: 16.9-27.2%), with the most common complication involving wound-healing problems (mean, 11.4%; 95% CI: 8.5-15.2%), and the frequency of implant loss (< 3 months) varied from 0% to 14% (mean, 2.2%; 95% CI: 1.1-4.4%). Seven articles reported patient-reported outcomes, and four reported aesthetic outcomes, with the quality of evidence classified as low for complications and very low for patient-reported outcomes and aesthetic outcomes.

Thus far, models have focused on the crucial roles that auxin transport and metabolism play in determining the auxin signaling gradient that controls the root meristem. Other hormones such as cytokinins, gibberellins, and ethylene have predominantly been considered as modulators of auxin dynamics, but their underlying patterning mechanisms are currently unresolved. In addition, the effects of cell- and tissue-level growth dynamics, which induce dilution and displacement of signaling molecules, have remained unexplored. Elucidating these additional mechanisms will be essential to unravel how root growth is patterned in a robust and self-organized manner.

This cross-sectional study used prospectively acquired data from a large consecutively included cohort. Participants were referred for cardiac CT based on symptoms of CAD. Quantitative CT (QCT) dedicated software was used to obtain BMD measurements in 3 vertebrae starting from the level of the left main coronary artery. We used the American College of Radiology cut-off values for lumbar spine QCT to categorize patients into very low (<80 mg/cm3), low (80-120 mg/cm3), or normal BMD (>120 mg/cm3).

In a bid to reduce the global burden of morbidity and mortality due to CVD, emphasis has been placed on prevention, particularly on widespread promotion of ideal cardiovascular health behaviors and advancing strategies to identify and treat high-risk individuals who may benefit from aggressive preventive therapy. Erectile dysfunction is a highly prevalent condition that has been demonstrated to share the same risk factors as clinical CVD, and to have independent predictive value for future CVD events. Importantly, subclinical atherosclerosis appears to precede vascular ED by a decade or longer, with ED preceding clinical CVD such as myocardial infarction and stroke in temporal sequence by about 2-5 years. Crucially, since ED may represent the first presentation of otherwise ""healthy"" men to care providers, a clinical diagnosis of vascular ED may represent a unique opportunity to identify high risk individuals, intervene, and thus prevent progression to clinical CVD. This review summarizes up-to-date evidence of the relationship between ED and subclinical and clinical CVD, and details the position of current guidelines and clinical recommendations on the role of ED assessment in CVD prevention. Finally, this review proposes a clinical framework for the incorporation of ED into standard CVD risk assessment in middle-age men.",Utilising the Delphi Process to Develop a Proficiency-based Progression Train-the-trainer Course for Robotic Surgery Training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665812,European urology,2019 04 26,"As the role of robot-assisted surgery continues to expand, development of standardised and validated training programmes is becoming increasingly important.",Anterior vs lateral symmetric interstitial syndrome in the diagnosis of acute heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665807,International journal of cardiology,2019 05 09,"Acute dyspnea due to acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the most common reasons for admission to the Emergency Department (ED).

This study compares the accuracy of LUS examination limited to the anterior or lateral lung zones for the diagnosis of AHF and their accuracy among patients with different levels of hypoxemia according to PO2/FiO2 ratio evaluation. We analyzed 170 patients admitted to the ED for acute dyspnea, who underwent multi-organ ultrasound examination of lung, heart and inferior vena cava for differential diagnosis. The thorax was examined following a simplified protocol that provides two scans at each side (anterior and lateral) to sample upper and lower lobes and the presence or the absence of interstitial syndrome (IS) was evaluated.

In this study, we investigated whether PPSs could exhibit adjuvant effect at the mucosa. Groups of mice were intranasally immunized with Epimedium Polysaccharide (EPS), Trollius chinensis polysaccharide (TCPS), Siberian solomonseal rhizome polysaccharide (SSRPS) and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) together with ovalbumin (OVA). Significantly higher levels of OVA-specific IgG in serum and secretory IgA in saliva, vaginal wash and intestinal lavage fluid were induced after immunization with OVA plus one of the four PPSs compared to OVA alone. Antigen absorption and TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) activation may be related to their mucosal adjuvant effect. Of note, when APS used as an adjuvant, intranasally vaccination with recombination UreB (rUreB, Urease subunit B) conferred more robust protection against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Immunized with rUreB in combination APS resulted in mixed specific Th1 and Th17 immune response, which may contribute to the inhibition of H. pylori colonization. Though specific Th2-dominant responses were elicited when the other three PPS intranasally immunized with rUreB, no significant difference in the protective effect were found between those groups and rUreb alone group. Taken together, the four PPSs may be promising candidates for mucosal adjuvant, and APS could enhance rUreB-specific protective immunity against H. pylori infection.",Minor Blunt Thoracic Trauma in the Emergency Department: Sensitivity and Specificity of Chest Ultralow-Dose Computed Tomography Compared With Conventional Radiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665773,Annals of emergency medicine,2019 05 28,To evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest ultralow-dose computed tomography (CT) compared with chest radiograph for minor blunt thoracic trauma.,Small HDL subclass is associated with coronary plaque stability: An optical coherence tomography study in patients with coronary artery disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665770,Journal of clinical lipidology,2019 05 03,"The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses in atherosclerotic diseases remains an open question.

Does it also exist in non-human animals? On some definitions of deception, altruistic deception is impossible by definition, whereas others make it too easy by counting useful-but-ambiguous information as deceptive. I argue for a definition that makes altruistic deception possible in principle without trivializing it. On my proposal, deception requires the strategic exploitation of a receiver by a sender, where ""exploitation"" implies that the sender elicits a behaviour in the receiver that is beneficial in a different type of situation and is expressed only because the signal raises the probability, from the receiver's standpoint, of that type of situation. I then offer an example of a real signal that is deceptive in this sense, and yet potentially altruistic (and certainly cooperative): the purr call of the pied babbler. Fledglings associate purr calls with food, and adults exploit this learned association, in the absence of food, to lead fledglings away from predators following an alarm call. I conclude by considering why altruistic deception is apparently so rare in non-human animals.",Clinical usefulness of two-phase 18F-sodium-fluoride (18F-NaF) bone PET/CT for evaluating treatment response of bone metastases from breast cancer: Case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665751,Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular,2019 01 22,"We report the case of a breast cancer patient in whom a two-phase 18F-sodium-fluoride (18F-NaF) bone PET/CT was useful for detecting hidden bone metastases and assessing treatment response.

In the perfusion and bone phase PET/CT images, focally increased perfusion and bony uptake were found in the sacrum and L5 vertebra, suggesting bone metastases of breast cancer. Therefore, the patient subsequently underwent palliative treatment. In another twoPET/CT studies (each including two-phase bone images) performed after 3and 6months of follow-up, the perfusion phase images showed an improvement of the lesion uptake more clearly than in the bone phase images in the visual and semi-quantitative analyses, and thus the perfusion phase images were more useful for clarifying the treatment response earlier than the bone phase images.

We examined 109 ""influential"" (i.e., well-cited) studies that cited the Cash and Deagle meta-analysis. We found a slight, continued emphasis on research using body size evaluation measures that implied a biological correlate for perceptual differences (especially for those with AN).

Twenty wine samples (Pfalz region, Germany) were diluted with methanol and used for quantitative analysis without any further sample preparation. The developed amino acid method provided quantitative and characteristic fingerprints of wine varieties. The amino acid assignments were verified by HPTLC-MS. The developed gluconic acid method was primarily used to control the threshold, indicating a Botrytis cinerea infection of grapes. However, this method also enabled the detection of further organic acids like malic, tartaric and citric acids. A glycerol method was developed for control of the grape must fermentation (spontaneous/regular) and for fraud detection (glycerol adulteration). The HPTLC results of the sugar contents in the wine samples were similar to those of the well-known Luff-Schoorl method. The combined use of these developed HPTLC methods allowed the fermentation control (e.g., alcoholic and malolactic fermentation) and the monitoring of the grapes' overall health status.

The optimized conditions were thoroughly validated, and the method was applied to determine the enzyme's kinetic parameters and the inhibition characteristics of three potent probe inhibitors. The obtained values were comparable to the literature data. Hence, the presented method, with its advantages of miniaturization and full automation, could be used for kinetic and inhibition studies of HDACs, which are targets for drug discovery, in the early stages of new drug development.",Investigating weathering in light diesel oils using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-High resolution mass spectrometry and pixel-based analysis: Possibilities and limitations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665741,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 10,"Petroleum-derived fuels are chronically spilled in urbanized areas, affecting the environment and the population's health. Forensic investigations of oil spills aim to find the responsible source of the spills. Weathering processes (dissolution, evaporation, photo-oxidation and biodegradation) change the chemical composition of the spills and hamper the matching of spill-source pairs, especially for light diesel oils (i.e. n-C9 - n-C20) in which the source diesels can be very similar due to the refining process and only compounds resistant to short- or middle-term weathering are present. In this study, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (GC × GC - HRMS) and pixel-based analysis were combined for: i) improve the identification of very similar diesel oils, and ii) identify weathering-resistant compounds that can also distinguish samples from different sources. Diesel oils from two sources that have been exposed to different degrees of evaporation, photo-oxidation and biodegradation in a laboratory setup. The study revealed the tentatively identified octanoic acid methyl ester and n-nonaldehyde were more resistance to evaporation than hydrocarbons < n-C15. Furthermore, the hydrocarbons > n-C17 could be used for source-apportionment of all the diesel oils susceptible to evaporation and photo-oxidation, but only pristane and phytane were also more resistant to biodegradation. Naphthenes, bicyclic sesquiterpanes and adamantanes were more resistant to only photo-oxidation and biodegradation. GC × GC - HRMS enhanced the separation of the highly similar naphthenes in the diesel oils; however, the diagnostic power for forensic spill investigations was still similar to 1D GC - HRMS."

Eleven RTE parameters before brain death and at 0, 3, 6 and 9 h after brain death in 12 miniature pigs were collected and analyzed, and the correlation of these parameters with electron microscopy results was explored. Six of the RTE parameters, namely, mean relative strain value within the region of interest, standard deviation of the relative strain value within the region of interest, area of low strain within the region of interest, complexity of low strain area within the region of interest, skewness and correlation, significantly differed among the time periods. Categorical data were analyzed using the χ2-test. Spearman's correlation analysis was used for evaluating correlations between RTE parameters and electron microscopy results, and the correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. Electron microscopy results revealed that liver damage gradually increased after brain death, with significant differences between 0 and 9 h (χ2 = 14.143, p value = 0.027). In addition, the six aforementioned RTE parameters significantly correlated with electron microscopy results, with the mean relative strain value within the region of interest being the strongest (r = -0.59, p value < 0.001) correlated parameter.

The thickness and elastic modulus of the skin were measured using US-SWE at 6 sites in 60 SSc patients and 60 healthy volunteers: the bilateral middle fingers and forearms and the anterior chest and abdomen. To evaluate clinical scores, the measurements were also extended to 17 skin sites in 30 patients. The diagnostic performance of US-SWE in the differentiation of SSc from healthy skin was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the reliability of the measurement was evaluated with intra- and inter-class correlation coefficients. The results of US-SWE were compared with modified Rodnan skin thickness scores. Our results indicated that (i) the elastic modulus values were significantly higher in SSc patients than in controls, with or without normalization by skin thickness; (ii) receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed normalized US-SWE cutoff values with a very high accuracy for right and left fingers (areas under the curve = 0.974 and 0.949), followed by left forearm (0.841), anterior abdomen (0.797), right forearm (0.772) and anterior chest (0.726); (iii) the reliability of US-SWE measurements was good for all examined sites with intra-observer correlation coefficients of 0.845-0.996 and inter-observer correlation coefficients of 0.824-0.985; and (iv) total scores of skin involvement determined at 17 sites (modified Rodnan skin thickness scores) correlated with skin stiffness (r = 0.832) and thickness (r = 0.736). In conclusion, US-SWE is a quantitative method with high specificity, sensitivity and reliability in the detection of SSc involvement.

RNA polymerase (RNAP) is known to serve as a sensor of DNA damage and to attract DNA repair factors to the damaged template sites. Here, we systematically investigated the ability of Escherichia coli RNAP to transcribe DNA templates containing various types of DNA lesions, and analyzed their effects on transcription fidelity. We showed that transcription is strongly inhibited on templates containing cyclobutane thymine dimers, 1,N6-ethenoadenine and abasic sites, while 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol have mild effects on transcription efficiency. Similarly to many polymerases, E. coli RNAP follows the ""A"" rule during nucleotide insertion opposite abasic sites and bulky lesions, and can also incorporate and efficiently extend an adenine nucleotide opposite 8-oxoguanine. Mutations in RNAP regions around the templating nucleotide decrease the efficiency of translesion synthesis, likely by altering the RNAP-template contacts in the active site. Thus, DNA lesions can lead to distinct outcomes in transcription, depending on the severity of the damage and contacts of the damaged template with the active site of RNAP.",Suppression of cell cycle progression by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor PJ34 in neural stem/progenitor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665718,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 02 02,"Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) express higher levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) than mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Inhibition of PARP induces the expression of several genes in the p53 signaling pathway, including p21, which is critical for cell cycle control at the G1/S phase, triggers apoptosis, and suppresses cell cycle progression in NSPCs. However, upon the up-regulation of p21, the cell cycle does not arrest at any specific phase. In the present study, the expression of genes specific to the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were analyzed following treatment with PJ34 (N-[6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl]-N,N-dimethylacetamide), an inhibitor of PARP. PJ34 treatment dramatically down-regulated cyclin B1 expression in NSPCs, but not in MEFs, which was confirmed by a promoter assay. Down-regulation of FoxM1 and B-MYB revealed that the down-regulation of cyclin B occurs at the transcriptional level. GADD45 was also specifically up-regulated in NSPCs. Taken together, the activation of p53 by PJ34 treatment in NSPCs induced changes in the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that PJ34 treatment suppressed G2/M to G1 progression in NSPCs, but not in MEFs. These data indicate that PJ34 treatment inhibits cyclin expression at the mRNA level and suppresses cell cycle progression in NSPCs.",Crystal structure and biochemical study on argininosuccinate lyase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665717,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 02 02,"Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) participates in arginine synthesis through catalysing a reversible reaction in which argininosuccinate (AS) converts into arginine and fumarate. ASL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential for its growth. In this work, the crystal structure of the apo form of MtbASL was determined and reveals a tetrameric structure that is essential for its activity since the active sites are formed by residues from three different monomers. Subsequently, we determined the crystal structure of MtbASL-sulfate complex, and the ligand mimics the negatively charged intermediate. The complex structure and mutagenesis studies indicate that residues S282 and H161 might act as a catalytic dyad. A major conformational change in the MtbASL-SO4 complex structure could be observed upon sulfate binding, and this movement facilitates the interaction between substrate and the residues involved in catalysis. A different conformational change in the C-terminal domain could be observed in the MtbASL-SO4 complex compared with that in other homologues. This difference may be responsible for the lower activity of MtbASL, which is related to the slow growth rate of M. tuberculosis. The C-terminal domain is a potential allosteric site upon inhibitor binding. The various conformational changes and the diversity of the sequence of the potential allosteric site across the homologues might provide clues for designing selective inhibitors against M. tuberculosis.",Negative effects of high mechanical tensile strain stimulation on chondrocyte injury in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665716,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 02 02,"The mechanism underlying the development of osteoarthritis induced by high tensile strain is unclear. In this study, the effects of different degrees of mechanical tensile strain stimulation on Sprague-Dawley rat chondrocytes were explored. Rat chondrocytes were subjected to mechanical tensile strain at different intensities and frequencies (control group, low tensile strain group, intermediate tensile strain group, and high tensile strain group) using a self-made in vitro tensile strain device. After applying mechanical tensile strain, chondrocytes were collected to detect the expression of collagen II, Aggrecan, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), ADAMTS5, and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) by fluorescence probes. Mechanical tensile strain at different frequencies and intensities had different effects on the biological functions of chondrocytes. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of Col II and Aggrecan in the low and intermediate tensile strain groups increased significantly, while the expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 decreased. There were no significant differences between the low and intermediate tensile strain groups. Col II and Aggrecan levels were significantly lower in the high tensile strain group than in the control group, while MMP13 and ADAMTS5 levels were higher. There were no significant differences in ROS production between the low and intermediate tensile strain groups and the control group, but the high tensile strain group exhibited significantly increased ROS production. The expression of UCP2 was significantly lower in the high tensile strain group than in all other groups. These results showed that stimulation with different levels of mechanical tensile strain has different effects on chondrocytes. Repeated high tensile strain promoted the anabolic function of chondrocytes, increased ROS production, and decreased UCP2. These results provide a potential mechanism by which osteoarthritis is induced by high mechanical tensile strain.",Changes in the Utilization of the BI-RADS Category 3 Assessment in Recalled Patients Before and After the Implementation of Screening Digital Breast Tomosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665715,Academic radiology,2019 01 22,The purpose of this study was to compare the utilization of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 assessment in patients recalled from screening before and after the implementation of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT).,Impact of baseline early auditory processing on response to cognitive remediation for schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665714,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 31,"Early auditory processing (EAP) has increasingly become a focus of efforts to identify biomarkers of treatment response in schizophrenia.

Ternary lipid bilayers composed of a high and a low melting temperature lipid and cholesterol represent a model system that mimics some of the important thermodynamical features of much more complex lipid mixtures such as those found in mammal membranes. The phase diagram of these ternary mixtures can be studied exploiting fluorescence microscopy in giant unilamellar vesicles, and it is typically expected to give rise, for specific combinations of composition and temperature, to regions of two-phase coexistence and a region with three-phase coexistence, namely, the liquid-ordered, liquid-disordered, and solid phases. Whereas the observation of two-phase coexistence is routinely possible using fluorescence microscopy, the three-phase region is more elusive to study. In this article, we show that particular lipid mixtures containing diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol plus different types of sphingomyelin (SM) are prone to produce bilayer regions with more than two levels of fluorescence intensity. We found that these intensity levels occur at low temperature and are linked to the copresence of long and asymmetric chains in SMs and diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine in the lipid mixtures. We discuss the possible interpretations for this observation in terms of bilayer phase organization in the presence of sphingolipids. Additionally, we also show that in some cases, liposomes in the three-phase coexistence state exhibit extreme sensitivity to lateral tension. We hypothesize that the appearance of the different phases is related to the asymmetric structure of SMs and to interdigitation effects.",Universal Kinetics of the Onset of Cell Spreading on Substrates of Different Stiffness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665696,Biophysical journal,2019 02 22,"When plated onto substrates, cell morphology and even stem-cell differentiation are influenced by the stiffness of their environment. Stiffer substrates give strongly spread (eventually polarized) cells with strong focal adhesions and stress fibers; very soft substrates give a less developed cytoskeleton and much lower cell spreading. The kinetics of this process of cell spreading is studied extensively, and important universal relationships are established on how the cell area grows with time. Here, we study the population dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic processes involved in the cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the individual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the substrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is observed. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time statistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier ΔG ≈ 18 kcal/mol, whereas the early-time kinetics follows a power law ∼t5. This implies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of adhesion complex assembly and activation; the operational complex must have five component proteins, and the last process in the sequence (which we believe is the activation of focal adhesion kinase) is controlled by the binding energy ΔG.",Magnetic Entropy as a Proposed Gating Mechanism for Magnetogenetic Ion Channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665695,Biophysical journal,2019 02 22,"Magnetically sensitive ion channels would allow researchers to better study how specific brain cells affect behavior in freely moving animals; however, recent reports of ""magnetogenetic"" ion channels based on biogenic ferritin nanoparticles have been questioned because known biophysical mechanisms cannot explain experimental observations. Here, we reproduce a weak magnetically mediated calcium response in HEK cells expressing a previously published TRPV4-ferritin fusion protein. We find that this magnetic sensitivity is attenuated when we reduce the temperature sensitivity of the channel but not when we reduce the mechanical sensitivity of the channel, suggesting that the magnetic sensitivity of this channel is thermally mediated. As a potential mechanism for this thermally mediated magnetic response, we propose that changes in the magnetic entropy of the ferritin particle can generate heat via the magnetocaloric effect and consequently gate the associated temperature-sensitive ion channel. Unlike other forms of magnetic heating, the magnetocaloric mechanism can cool magnetic particles during demagnetization. To test this prediction, we constructed a magnetogenetic channel based on the cold-sensitive TRPM8 channel. Our observation of a magnetic response in cold-gated channels is consistent with the magnetocaloric hypothesis. Together, these new data and our proposed mechanism of action provide additional resources for understanding how ion channels could be activated by low-frequency magnetic fields.",Anisotropic Material Properties of Wild-Type and Tectb-/- Tectorial Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665694,Biophysical journal,2019 02 22,"The tectorial membrane (TM) is an extracellular matrix that is directly coupled with the mechanoelectrical receptors responsible for sensory transduction and amplification. As such, the TM is often hypothesized to play a key role in the remarkable sensory abilities of the mammalian cochlea. Genetic studies targeting TM proteins have shown that changes in TM structure dramatically affect cochlear function in mice. Precise information about the mechanical properties of the TMs of wild-type and mutant mice at audio frequencies is required to elucidate the role of the TM and to understand how these genetic mutations affect cochlear mechanics. In this study, images of isolated TM segments are used to determine both the radial and longitudinal motions of the TM in response to a harmonic radial excitation. The resulting longitudinally propagating radial displacement and highly spatially dependent longitudinal displacement are modeled using finite-element models that take into account the anisotropy and finite dimensions of TMs. An automated, least-square fitting algorithm is used to find the anisotropic material properties of wild-type and Tectb-/- mice at audio frequencies. Within the auditory frequency range, it is found that the TM is a highly viscoelastic and anisotropic structure with significantly higher stiffness in the direction of the collagen fibers. Although no decrease in the stiffness in the fiber direction is observed, the stiffness of the TM in shear and in the transverse direction is found to be significantly reduced in Tectb-/- mice. As a result, TMs of the mutant mice tend to be significantly more anisotropic within the frequency range examined in this study. The effects of the Tectb-/- mutation on the TM's anisotropic material properties may be responsible for the changes in cochlear tuning and sensitivity that have been previously reported for these mice.",A New Computational Method for Membrane Compressibility: Bilayer Mechanical Thickness Revisited.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665693,Biophysical journal,2019 02 22,"Because lipid bilayers can bend and stretch in ways similar to thin elastic sheets, physical models of bilayer deformation have utilized mechanical constants such as the moduli for bending rigidity (κC) and area compressibility (KA). However, the use of these models to quantify the energetics of membrane deformation associated with protein-membrane interactions, and the membrane response to stress is often hampered by the shortage of experimental data suitable for the estimation of the mechanical constants of various lipid mixtures. Although computational tools such as molecular dynamics simulations can provide alternative means to estimate KA values, current approaches suffer significant technical limitations. Here, we present a novel, to our knowledge, computational framework that allows for a direct estimation of KA values for individual bilayer leaflets. The theory is based on the concept of elasticity and derives KA from real-space analysis of local thickness fluctuations sampled in molecular dynamics simulations. We explore and validate the model on a large set of single and multicomponent bilayers of different lipid compositions and sizes, simulated at different temperatures. The calculated bilayer compressibility moduli agree with values estimated previously from experiments and those obtained from a standard computational method based on a series of constrained tension simulations. We further validate our framework in a comparison with an existing polymer brush model and confirm the polymer brush model's predicted linear relationship with proportionality coefficient of 24, using elastic parameters calculated from the simulation trajectories. The robustness of the results that emerge from the method allows us to revisit the origins of the bilayer mechanical (compressible) thickness and in particular its dependence on acyl-chain unsaturation and the presence of cholesterol.",Antitumor effect of a dual cancer-specific oncolytic adenovirus on prostate cancer PC-3 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665692,Urologic oncology,2019 05 11,"Apoptin can specifically kill cancer cells but has no toxicity to normal cells.

In terms of blood transfusion safety, these measures as well as the broader spectrum of Ia, particularly for arboviruses, are a real breakthrough. The survey conducted in clinical services and the services providing blood products for transfusion along with a literature review have shown that several improvements need to be made. The first is a reduction of transfusions of concentrated red blood cells with introduction at a threshold of 7g/dL during hospitalization of patients without a fragile clinical status. The second improvement would address transfusion of refractory thrombocytopenia, encouraging an increase in discussion between clinicians and those conducting the transfusion in order to consider different etiologies and to identify appropriate care protocols. Third would be the need for the transmission of information between the transplantation doctors and blood transfusion specialists in order to define an approach to transfusion care adapted to the patient's situation. It is important to inform and educate patients about transfusion protocols post allotransplant or autotransplant. It must be clearly communicated to patients that they should always have on their person their blood group documentation. This is especially true when receiving care for a hemopathy or an autologous transplant. If undergoing an allogeneic transplant, patients should also carry transfusion guidelines post autotransplant or post allotransplant along with the phone numbers for the stem cell transplantation department and the blood transfusion center responsible for their care.",Acute Pharmacological Management of Behavioral and Emotional Dysregulation Following a Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665668,Psychosomatics,2019 04 19,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly common cause of behavioral and emotional dysregulation among hospitalized patients.

The Social Return on Investment (SROI), a framework that is recognised by the government, explores the wider social value of interventions, but has not yet, to our knowledge, been used to measure the value of surgical procedures. To test its feasibility in a surgical setting and to begin to understand the wider nature of the changes experienced by patients after orthognathic surgery, we designed a pilot study that focused on the first two stages of the six-stage model. We collected data from 16 participants about their perceptions and experiences of the short, medium, and longer term outcomes of their treatment during two qualitative storyboard workshops. A grounded theory-SROI method was used to explore their experiences through a process of constant comparison by which data were analysed for concepts and organised into distinct themes. This produced a theory of change that clearly expressed the short to medium-term and longer term outcomes of orthognathic treatment, and provided an initial framework for the approach. The theory captured several outcomes and showed that the framework can be used effectively to investigate the wider psychosocial changes after orthognathic treatment. It therefore provides a basis on which to develop potential indicators for the assessment and valuation of these outcomes over time. The application of these findings to the selection of patients, engagement, and postoperative care, is briefly discussed.",Evolution in the management of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: systematic review of outcomes over the last 25 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665664,The British journal of oral & maxillofacial surgery,2019 04 23,"The treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has evolved over the last 25years, from open surgery to combined chemoradiotherapy, and now to the development of minimally invasive procedures, but evidence for the best treatment is lacking. We therefore did a systematic search of the MEDLINE database for studies published between 1992 and 2017 that reported oncological or functional outcomes, or both. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for screening and selection, and 45 studies were chosen. Only one was a randomised controlled trial, all the rest were prospective or retrospective case series. The heterogeneities in their characteristics made meta-analysis impossible and only qualitative analysis was feasible. We found no conclusive evidence to suggest the advantage of one therapeutic approach over another, so we still cannot offer patients the ""ideal"" treatment.

Disturbed macrophage characteristics might be essential in obesity associated pregnancy pathology via effects on the regulation of angiogenesis and placental development. This study aims to address the effects of maternal obesity on macrophage subsets in the decidua of women with term uncomplicated pregnancies. Macrophages were isolated from the decidua basalis and decidua parietalis of women with pre-gravid BMI < 25 (control) and BMI > 30 (obese). Macrophages were characterized and quantified using multi-color flow cytometry. Placentas of 10 obese and 10 control women after an uncomplicated term pregnancy were included. The decidua parietalis, but not decidua basalis, showed significantly lower levels of M1-type (HLA-DR+, CD163-) macrophages (p < 0.05) in obese women (4,3% of total macrophages) compared to control women (5,3% of total macrophages). The lower levels of M1 macrophages, considered to be pro-inflammatory, might indicate a mechanism to compensate for the pro-inflammatory environment in obese women to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes.",Fungicide tolerant Bradyrhizobium japonicum mitigate toxicity and enhance greengram production under hexaconazole stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665660,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"Bacterial strain RV9 recovered from greengram nodules tolerated 2400μg/mL of hexaconazole and was identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as Bradyrhizobium japonicum (KY940048). Strain RV9 produced IAA (61.6μg/mL), ACC deaminase (51.7mg/(protein·hr)), solubilized TCP (105μg/mL), secreted 337.6μg/mL EPS, and produced SA (52.2μg/mL) and 2,3-DHBA (28.3μg/mL). Exopolysaccharides produced by strain RV9 was quantified and characterized by SEM, AFM, EDX and FTIR. Beyond tolerance limit, hexaconazole caused cellular impairment and reduced the viability of strain RV9 revealed by SEM and CLSM. Hexaconazole distorted the root tips and altered nodule structure leading thereby to reduction in the performance of greengram. Also, the level of antioxidant enzymes, proline, TBARS, ROS and cell death was increased in hexaconazole treated plants. CLSM images revealed a concentration dependent increase in the characteristic green and blue fluorescence of hexaconazole treated roots. The application of B. japonicum strain RV9 alleviated the fungicide toxicity and improved the measured plant characteristics. Also, rhizobial cells were localized inside tissues as revealed by CLSM. Colonization of B. japonicum strain RV9 decreased the levels of CAT, POD, APX, GPX and TBARS by 80%, 5%, 13%, 13% and 19%, respectively over plants grown at 80μg/(hexaconazole·kg) soil. The ability to detoxify hexaconazole, colonize plant tissues, secrete PGP bioactive molecules even under fungicide pressure and its unique ability to diminish oxidative stress make B. japonicum an attractive choice for remediation of fungicide polluted soils and to concurrently enhance greengram production under stressed environment.",Dye removal by eco-friendly physically cross-linked double network polymer hydrogel beads and their functionalized composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665659,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"Hydrogels have attracted large attention in wastewater treatment fields due to their low-cost and good interaction with pollutants, among which novel double network hydrogel is an outstanding class. To expand the application of double network hydrogel in water treatment, in this study, eco-friendly physically cross-linked double network polymer hydrogel beads (DAP) are prepared and studied in depth on the mechanism of Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption; and then the polymer hydrogels are further functionalized by inorganic materials. MB adsorption on DAP favors alkaline condition which is due to the increase of electrostatic attraction and adsorption site, and it reaches equilibrium within 10 hr, which is faster than that of the single network hydrogel beads (SAP). Through thermodynamics study, the process shows to be an exothermic and spontaneous process. The adsorption isotherms are well fitted by Langmuir model, with a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 1437.48 mg/g, which is larger than SAP (1255.75 mg/g). After being functionalized with common inorganic materials including activated carbon, Fe3O4 and graphene oxide (GO), the composites show to have larger pore sizes and have obvious increases in adsorption capacity especially the one contains GO. Then the composites contains Fe3O4 are used as heterogeneous Fenton catalyst which shows to have excellent performance in MB degradation.

Bicarbonate formation from carbon dioxide's reaction with water has been suggested as an effective alternative for capturing CO2; however, the thermodynamics of this reaction are not well understood. This study experimentally determined the equilibrium constant of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposition to sodium, water, and carbon dioxide; the study also compared the equilibrium constant to theoretical calculations. Using a combination of experimentation and thermodynamic relationships, the unitless equilibrium constants of the forward and reverse reactions were calculated accurately (error <±9% and <±4%, respectively). Equilibrium data were calculated using enthalpy and entropy values of each component of NaHCO3 decomposition at temperatures ranging from 25 to 155°C respectively. These results offer more data essential to optimizing NaHCO3 use in environmentally friendly next-generation CO2-capture technologies."

Pyrite is one of the main minerals in cyanide tailings. The removal of cyanide adsorbed on pyrite by H2O2 oxidation under alkaline conditions was investigated in this study. It was found that the removal efficiency was positively correlated with pH from 5 to 12, but remained almost constant when pH was higher than 12. The highest cyanide removal efficiency of 91.10% was achieved by adding no less than 0.6 wt.% of H2O2. Cyanide removal was positively correlated with the CN- adsorption amount between 1.06 and 8.5 mg/g, and temperature between 25 and 85°C. The removal of cyanide adsorbed on pyrite by H2O2 oxidation under alkaline conditions was due to the oxidation of pyrite.

Improving soil formation process to revegetate the special degraded lands is a promising strategy for sustainable management of the refining industry. A laboratory incubation experiment was used to evaluate the effects of gypsum and vermicompost on stable aggregate formation of bauxite residue. Aggregate size distribution was quantified by fractal theory, whilst residue microstructure was determined by scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray micro-computed tomography. Amendments addition increased the content of macro-aggregates (>250 μm) and enhanced aggregate stability of bauxite residue. Following gypsum and vermicompost addition, fractal dimension decreased from 2.84 to 2.77, which indicated a more homogeneous distribution of aggregate particles. Images from scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional microstructure demonstrated that amendments stimulate the formation of improved structure in residue aggregates. Pore parameters including porosity, pore throat surface area, path length, and path tortuosity increased under amendment additions. Changes in aggregate size distribution and microstructure of bauxite residue indicated that additions of gypsum and vermicompost were beneficial to physical condition of bauxite residue which may enhance the ease of vegetation.",Removal characteristics of microplastics by Fe-based coagulants during drinking water treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665645,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"Microplastics have caused great concern worldwide recently due to their ubiquitous presence within the marine environment. Up to now, most attention has been paid to their sources, distributions, measurement methods, and especially their eco-toxicological effects. With microplastics being increasingly detected in freshwater, it is urgently necessary to evaluate their behaviors during coagulation and ultrafiltration (UF) processes. Herein, the removal behavior of polyethylene (PE), which is easily suspended in water and is the main component of microplastics, was investigated with commonly used Fe-based salts. Results showed that although higher removal efficiency was induced for smaller PE particles, low PE removal efficiency (below 15%) was observed using the traditional coagulation process, and was little influenced by water characteristics. In comparison to solution pH, PAM addition played a more important role in increasing the removal efficiency, especially anionic PAM at high dosage (with efficiency up to 90.9%). The main reason was ascribed to the dense floc formation and high adsorption ability because of the positively charged Fe-based flocs under neutral conditions. For ultrafiltration, although PE particles could be completely rejected, slight membrane fouling was caused owing to their large particle size. The membrane flux decreased after coagulation; however, the membrane fouling was less severe than that induced by flocs alone due to the heterogeneous nature of the cake layer caused by PE, even at high dosages of Fe-based salts. Based on the behavior exhibited during coagulation and ultrafiltration, we believe these findings will have potential application in drinking water treatment.",Iron toxicity resistance strategies in tropical grasses: The role of apoplastic radicular barriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665644,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"The revegetation of mined areas poses a great challenge to the iron ore mining industry. The initial recovery process in degraded areas might rely on the use of Fe-resistant grasses. Tropical grasses, such as Paspalum densum and Echinochloa crus-galli, show different resistance strategies to iron toxicity; however, these mechanisms are poorly understood. The Fe-resistance mechanisms and direct iron toxicity as a function of root apex removal were investigated. To achieve this purpose, both grass species were grown for up to 480 hr in a nutrient solution containing 0.019 or 7 mmol/L Fe-EDTA after the root apices had been removed or maintained. Cultivation in the presence of excess iron-induced leaf bronzing and the formation of iron plaque on the root surfaces of both grass species, but was more significant on those plants whose root apex had been removed. Iron accumulation was higher in the roots, but reached phytotoxic levels in the aerial parts as well. It did not hinder the biosynthesis of chloroplastidic pigments. No significant changes in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence occurred in either grass when their roots were kept intact; the contrary was true for plants with excised root apices. In both studied grasses, the root apoplastic barriers had an important function in the restriction of iron translocation from the root to the aerial plant parts, especially in E. crus-galli. Root apex removal negatively influenced the iron toxicity resistance mechanisms (tolerance in P. densum and avoidance in E. crus-galli).",Monitoring biofouling based on aerobic respiration in reverse osmosis system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665643,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"A monitoring method of biofouling in reverse osmosis (RO) system was proposed based on the fluorescent signal of resorufin, which is reduced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide released from viable cells during aerobic respiration. The fluorescent signal of resorufin reduced by planktonic cells and microorganisms of biofilm showed linearity, indicating its feasibility to monitor biofouling in a RO system. For the application of the method to the lab-scale RO system, the injection concentration of resazurin and the injection flow rate were optimized. Biofilm on RO membranes continuously operated in a lab-scale RO system was estimated by resorufin fluorescence under optimized detection condition. As a result, resorufin fluorescence on RO membrane showed a significant increase in which the permeability of RO system decreased by 30.48%. Moreover, it represented the development of biofilm as much as conventional biofilm parameters such as adenosine triphosphate, extracellular polymeric substances, and biofilm thickness. The proposed method could be used as a sensitive and low-cost technology to monitor biofouling without autopsy of membranes.",Removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from different soil fractions by persulfate oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665642,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"Removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from different soil fractions of contaminated soil was investigated by using activated persulfate oxidation remediation in our research. The results showed that the light fraction, which accounted for only 10% of the soil, contained 30% of the PAHs at a concentration of 4352 mg/kg. The heavy fraction contained more high-molecular-weight PAHs, and the total PAH concentration was 625 mg/kg. After being oxidized, the removal rate of PAHs was 39% in the light fraction and nearly 90% in the heavy fraction. Among the different fractions of the heavy fraction, humic acid contained the highest concentration of PAHs, and consequently, the highest removal efficiency of PAHs was also in humic acid. Compared with the light fraction, the heavy fraction has more aromatic compounds and those compounds were broken down during the oxidation process, which may be the removal mechanism involved in the oxidation of high-ring PAHs. Similarly, the enhancement of C=C bonds after oxidation can also explain the poor removal of high-ring PAHs in the light fraction. These results imply that different fractions of soil vary in composition and structure, leading to differences in the distribution and oxidation efficiencies of PAHs.",Effect of an eco-friendly o/w emulsion stabilized with amphiphilic sodium alginate derivatives on lambda-cyhalothrin adsorption-desorption on natural soil minerals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665641,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"The effects of amphiphilic O/W emulsions, stabilized by the alkyl polyglycoside (APG) or cholesterol-grafted sodium alginate (CSAD)/APG systems, on lambda-cyhalothrin adsorption/desorption mechanisms on natural soil minerals (i.e., illite and kaolinite) were investigated. Sorption and desorption of lambda-cyhalothrin onto soil minerals was studied via batch equilibration to give insight into the adsorption equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics of lambda-cyhalothrin adsorption onto minerals. The results indicate the following: (i) The adsorption processes for the APG system and CSAD/APG system include: rapid adsorption, slow adsorption, and adsorption equilibrium. The adsorption kinetics of pesticide on illite and kaolinite are in accordance with the Ho and McKay model, and the adsorption isotherm conforms to the Freundlich model. In addition, the adsorption processes of pesticide for the two systems on minerals were spontaneous and feasible (ΔG0 < 0), endothermic (ΔH0 > 0), and mainly involved chemical bonding (ΔH0 > 60). (ii) The equilibrium adsorption percentages of the pesticide on illite for the APG system and CSAD/APG system were 42.4% and 64.8%, and the corresponding equilibrium adsorption percentages on kaolinite were 40.8% and 61.8%, respectively. Moreover, the pesticide adsorption rate K2-CSAD/APG was faster than K2-APG, and its adsorption capacity Kf-CSAD/APG was greater than Kf-APG. Meanwhile, the pesticide desorption Kfd in the CSAD/APG system was smaller than that in the APG system. As a result, this eco-friendly O/W emulsion based on amphiphilic sodium alginate derivatives might provide a green pesticide formulation, since it could reduce the amount of lambda-cyhalothrin entering aquatic systems to threaten non-target fish and invertebrate species.",One-step preparation of polyimide-inlaid amine-rich porous organic block copolymer for efficient removal of chlorophenols from aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665640,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"A novel polyimide-inlaid amine-rich porous organic block copolymer (PI-b-ARPOP) was prepared via one-step polymerization by using different molar ratios of melamine (MA)/terephthalaldehyde (TA)/pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), at molar ratios of 4/3/1, 4/2/2 and 4/1/3. The copolymer contained both aminal groups belonging to ARPOP and imide groups belonging to PI, and the bonding styles of the monomers and growth orientations of the polymeric chains were diversiform, forming an excellent porous structure. Notably, MA/TA/PMDA (4/2/2) had a surface area and pore volume of 487.27 m2/g and 1.169 cm3/g, respectively. The adsorption performance of the materials towards 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in ultra-pure water was systematically studied. The pH value of 7 was optimal in aqueous solution. Na+ and Cl- ions did not negatively affect the adsorption process, while humic acid (HA) slightly decreased the capacity. The equilibrium time was 40 sec, and the maximum adsorption capacity reached 282.49 mg/g at 298 K. The removal process was endothermic and spontaneous, and the copolymer could maintain its porous structure and consistent performance after regeneration by treatment with alkali. Moreover, to further assess the practical applicability of the material, the adsorption performance towards 2,4-DCP in river water was also investigated. This paper demonstrated that the PI-b-ARPOP can be an efficient and practical adsorbent to remove chlorophenols from aqueous solution.",Impact of chlorine exposure time on disinfection byproduct formation in the presence of iopamidol and natural organic matter during chloramination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665639,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"Chloramines, in practice, are formed onsite by adding ammonia to chlorinated drinking water to achieve the required disinfection. While regulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are reduced during chloramine disinfection, other DBPs such as iodinated (iodo-) DBPs, that elicit greater toxicity are formed. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of prechlorination time on the formation of both halogen-specific total organic halogen (TOX) and iodo/chlorinated (chloro-) DBPs during prechlorination/chloramination in source waters (SWs) containing iopamidol, an X-ray contrast medium. Barberton SW (BSW) and Cleveland SW (CSW) containing iopamidol were prechlorinated for 5-60 min and afterwards chloraminated for 72 hr with ammonium chloride. Chlorine contact time (CCT) did not significantly impact total organic iodine (TOI) concentrations after prechlorination or chloramination. Concentrations of total organic chlorine (TOCl) formed during prechlorination did not significantly change regardless of pH and prechlorination time, while TOCl appeared to decrease after 72 hr chloramination period. Dichloroiodomethane (CHCl2I) formation during prechlorination did not exhibit any significant trends as a function of pH or CCT, but after chloramination, significant increases were observed at pHs 6.5 and 7.5 with respect to CCT. Iodo-HAAs were not formed during prechlorination but were detected after chloramination. Significant quantities of chloroform (CHCl3) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) were formed during prechlorination but formation ceased upon ammonia addition. Therefore, prechlorination studies should measure TOX and DBP concentrations prior to ammonia addition to obtain data regarding the initial conditions.",Maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) nanoparticles enhance dissimilatory ferrihydrite reduction by Geobacter sulfurreducens: Impacts on iron mineralogical change and bacterial interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665638,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 30,"Microbially mediated bioreduction of iron oxyhydroxide plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of iron. Geobacter sulfurreducens is a representative dissimilatory iron-reducing bacterium that assembles electrically conductive pili and cytochromes. The impact of supplementation with γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) (0.2 and 0.6 g) on the G. sulfurreducens-mediated reduction of ferrihydrite was investigated. In the overall performance of microbial ferrihydrite reduction mediated by γ-Fe2O3 NPs, stronger reduction was observed in the presence of direct contact with γ-Fe2O3 NPs than with indirect contact. Compared to the production of Fe(II) derived from biotic modification with ferrihydrite alone, increases greater than 1.6- and 1.4-fold in the production of Fe(II) were detected in the biotic modifications in which direct contact with 0.2 g and 0.6 g γ-Fe2O3 NPs, respectively, occurred. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that magnetite was a unique representative iron mineral in ferrihydrite when active G. sulfurreducens cells were in direct contact with γ-Fe2O3 NPs. Because of the sorption of biogenic Fe(II) onto γ-Fe2O3 NPs instead of ferrihydrite, the addition of γ-Fe2O3 NPs could also contribute to increased duration of ferrihydrite reduction by preventing ferrihydrite surface passivation. Additionally, electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the direct addition of γ-Fe2O3 NPs stimulated the electrically conductive pili and cytochromes to stretch, facilitating long-range electron transfer between the cells and ferrihydrite. The obtained findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of iron oxide NPs on soil biogeochemistry."

With careful care coordination EBRT and brachytherapy can be successfully delivered at different treatment centers without compromising treatment time and outcome in areas where access to brachytherapy maybe limited.,Dual roles of heparanase in human carotid plaque calcification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665614,Atherosclerosis,2019 03 23,"Calcification is a hallmark of advanced atherosclerosis and an active process akin to bone remodeling. Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-β-glucuronidase, which cleaves glycosaminoglycan chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The role of HPSE is controversial in osteogenesis and bone remodeling while it is unexplored in vascular calcification. Previously, we reported upregulation of HPSE in human carotid endarterectomies from symptomatic patients and showed correlation of HPSE expression with markers of inflammation and increased thrombogenicity. The present aim is to investigate HPSE expression in relation to genes associated with osteogenesis and osteolysis and the effect of elevated HPSE expression on calcification and osteolysis in vitro.","Using an anonymous, resident-run reporting mechanism to track self-reported duty hours.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665613,American journal of surgery,2019 06 16,"Implementation of resident duty hour policies has resulted in a need to document work hours accurately.

The primary objectives of this comparative efficacy study were to examine the impact of adjunct aggression interventions delivered during treatment on aggression and substance use outcomes, including: a) an acute treatment phase 6-session integrated Motivational Interviewing-Cognitive Behavioral Treatment intervention (MI-CBT) for aggression and substance use prevention, b) MI-CBT plus a 12-week telephone-based Continuing Care (MI-CBT + CC) intervention, and c) an acute phase single session control condition [including some discussion of violence prevention and local violence prevention resources (Enhanced Treatment as Usual (E-TAU))]. Participants (N = 180; 165 males and 15 females) were Veterans with SUD problems and past-year severe aggression who were randomized to one of three conditions: MI-CBT, MI-CBT + CC, or E-TAU. Primary 12-month outcomes included physical aggression and injury to partners, non-partners, and total aggression (collapsing across partner and non-partner relationships). Substance use outcomes included heavy drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use, and overall illicit substance use. Due to low representation in the sample (n = 4 women in each group at follow-up), women were excluded from primary analyses. According to unadjusted analyses of male participants, all groups showed similar significant declines in aggression over time, with the MI-CBT and MI-CBT + CC groups showing significant reductions in more substance use outcomes (heavy drinking, cocaine use, overall illicit drug use) than the E-TAU group. The only significant group x time interaction was for partner physical aggression by men (those in the MI-CBT + CC group showed a significantly greater decrease from baseline to follow-up). Also, neither the MI-CBT nor MI-CBT + CC groups reported any injuring of partners during the follow-up. For heavy drinking, cocaine, marijuana and overall illicit drug use, there were significant reductions over time, but no group by time interaction effects. The findings illustrate significant reductions in aggression and substance use over time for those involved in VA SUD treatment, and a potential modest benefit of additional integrated treatment approaches (MI-CBT, MI-CBT + CC) on reducing aggression. Future studies should examine dissemination efforts in the VA, cost-effectiveness, and moderators of outcome.","Does co-location of medication assisted treatment and prenatal care for women with opioid use disorder increase pregnancy planning, length of interpregnancy interval, and postpartum contraceptive uptake?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665607,Journal of substance abuse treatment,2019 01 22,"Women with opioid use disorder have higher rates of unplanned pregnancies, shorter interpregnancy intervals and lower rates of contraceptive use compared to women without substance use disorders.

The development of effective targeted therapies for some chronic itch disorders such as atopic dermatitis has given widespread recognition to the importance of measuring itch in clinical trials. Clinical trials now use itch measurement as a primary outcome measure, and steps toward the standardization of itch assessment are being made to meet the growing need for reliably measuring itch and its impact on quality of life in the clinical research setting. Itch can be evaluated via subjective patient-reported assessments or by objective measurement of scratching activity and scratching-induced skin changes. Herein, methods for the subjective assessment of itch via both unidimensional and multidimensional tools are discussed.",Noninvasive diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy using phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665573,Kidney international,2019 01 22,"Kidney biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose membranous nephropathy (MN). Approximately 70%-80% of patients with primary MN have anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies. We hypothesized that PLA2R antibody testing without kidney biopsy may be a valid strategy to make a non-invasive diagnosis of MN in patients with a negative work-up for secondary causes. The medical records of all Mayo Clinic patients in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona with serum PLA2R antibody tests between January 2015 and June 2018 were reviewed. PLA2R antibody testing was performed in 838 unique patients, with 143 testing positive. In 132 of these patients, a native kidney biopsy was performed. The primary diagnosis in all biopsies was MN. Potential secondary causes were identified in 35 cases, with the most common being malignancy and autoimmunity. Ninety-seven patients had a negative work-up for secondary causes of MN. Sixty of those 97 patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 ml/min/1.73m2. In these patients, the kidney biopsy did not provide significant information that altered management; one patient had a superimposed diabetic nephropathy and a second patient had a superimposed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) lesion. Among the 37 patients with primary MN and eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2, additional findings included acute interstitial nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and cellular crescents in one case each. Thus, among patients with preserved kidney function and no evidence of secondary causes, a positive PLA2R antibody test highly predicts a tissue diagnosis of PLA2R-associated MN. Further validation in a prospective study is warranted to determine whether PLA2R antibody testing be used as a non-invasive diagnostic test to guide therapy.",A distinct bone phenotype in ADPKD patients with end-stage renal disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665572,Kidney international,2019 01 22,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is among the most common hereditary nephropathies. Low bone turnover osteopenia has been reported in mice with conditional deletion of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes in osteoblasts, and preliminary clinical data also suggest suppressed bone turnover in patients with ADPKD. The present study compared the bone phenotype between patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) due to ADPKD and controls with ESRD due to other causes. Laboratory parameters of bone mineral metabolism (fibroblast growth factor 23 and sclerostin), bone turnover markers (bone alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b) and bone mineral density (BMD, by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, DXA) were assessed in 518 patients with ESRD, including 99 with ADPKD. Bone histomorphometry data were available in 71 patients, including 10 with ADPKD. Circulating levels of bone alkaline phosphatase were significantly lower in patients with ADPKD (17.4 vs 22.6 ng/mL), as were histomorphometric parameters of bone formation. Associations between ADPKD and parameters of bone formation persisted after adjustment for classical determinants including parathyroid hormone, age, and sex. BMD was higher in skeletal sites rich in cortical bone in patients with ADPKD compared to non-ADPKD patients (Z-score midshaft radius -0.04 vs -0.14; femoral neck -0.72 vs -1.02). Circulating sclerostin levels were significantly higher in ADPKD patients (2.20 vs 1.84 ng/L). In conclusion, patients with ESRD due to ADPKD present a distinct bone and mineral phenotype, characterized by suppressed bone turnover, better preserved cortical BMD, and high sclerostin levels.",Knockout of TRPC6 promotes insulin resistance and exacerbates glomerular injury in Akita mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665571,Kidney international,2019 01 22,"Gain-of-function mutations in TRPC6 cause familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and TRPC6 is upregulated in glomerular diseases including diabetic kidney disease. We studied the effect of systemic TRPC6 knockout in the Akita model of type 1 diabetes. Knockout of TRPC6 inhibited albuminuria in Akita mice at 12 and 16 weeks of age, but this difference disappeared by 20 weeks. Knockout of TRPC6 also reduced tubular injury in Akita mice; however, mesangial expansion was significantly increased. Hyperglycemia and blood pressure were similar between TRPC6 knockout and wild-type Akita mice, but knockout mice were more insulin resistant. In cultured podocytes, knockout of TRPC6 inhibited expression of the calcium/calcineurin responsive gene insulin receptor substrate 2 and decreased insulin responsiveness. Insulin resistance is reported to promote diabetic kidney disease independent of blood glucose levels. While the mechanisms are not fully understood, insulin activates both Akt2 and ERK, which inhibits apoptosis signal regulated kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38-induced apoptosis. In cultured podocytes, hyperglycemia stimulated p38 signaling and induced apoptosis, which was reduced by insulin and ASK1 inhibition and enhanced by Akt or ERK inhibition. Glomerular p38 signaling was increased in TRPC6 knockout Akita mice and was associated with enhanced expression of the p38 gene target cyclooxygenase 2. These data suggest that knockout of TRPC6 in Akita mice promotes insulin resistance and exacerbates glomerular disease independent of hyperglycemia.",Sodium and water handling during hemodialysis: new pathophysiologic insights and management approaches for improving outcomes in end-stage kidney disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665570,Kidney international,2019 01 22,"Space medicine and new technology such as magnetic resonance imaging of tissue sodium stores (23NaMRI) have changed our understanding of human sodium homeostasis and pathophysiology. It has become evident that body sodium comprises 3 main components. Two compartments have been traditionally recognized, namely one that is circulating and systemically active via its osmotic action, and one slowly exchangeable pool located in the bones. The third, recently described pool represents sodium stored in skin and muscle interstitium, and it is implicated in cell and biologic activities via local hypertonicity and sodium clearance mechanisms. This in-depth review provides a comprehensive view on the pathophysiology and existing knowledge gaps of systemic hemodynamic and tissue sodium accumulation in dialysis patients. Furthermore, we discuss how the combination of novel technologies to quantitate tissue salt accumulation (e.g., 23NaMRI) with devices to facilitate the precise attainment of a prescribed hemodialytic sodium mass balance (e.g., sodium and water balancing modules) will improve our therapeutic approach to sodium management in dialysis patients. While prospective studies are required, we think that these new diagnostic and sodium balancing tools will enhance our ability to pursue more personalized therapeutic interventions on sodium and water management, with the eventual goal of improving dialysis patient outcomes.",Management and treatment of glomerular diseases (part 2): conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Controversies Conference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665569,Kidney international,2019 01 22,"In November 2017, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative brought a diverse panel of experts in glomerular diseases together to discuss the 2012 KDIGO glomerulonephritis guideline in the context of new developments and insights that had occurred over the years since its publication.

Adequate hydration should be recommended in all patients. Calcium intake should not be restricted and vitamin D deficiency should be corrected aiming at a serum concentration of 25OHD of >20 ng/mL or even higher (>30 ng/mL according to some opinion leaders). Pharmacologic therapy is not an alternative to PTx and could be considered in patients who meet the surgical criteria but unwilling to undergo PTx, as well as in patients with an increased risk of surgery or failed surgery. Targeted therapy includes antiresorptive drugs for skeletal protection and cinacalcet for lowering serum calcium. Combined therapy can be an option when appropriate. Pregnant women should be treated conservatively (hydration) and surgery, if needed, performed in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Clinical endocrinology & metabolism,2019 04 24,"Several studies suggested that the condition of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) may be associated not only with the classical bone, kidney and gastrointestinal consequences, but also with cardiovascular, neuromuscular and articular complications, impaired quality of life and increased cancer risk. However, the only cardiovascular complications associated with PHPT, which seems to improve after parathyroidectomy, is left ventricular hypertrophy, while, data regarding the reversibility of hypertension, valve calcifications and increased vascular stiffness are inconsistent. Parathyroidectomy seems to ameliorate neuropsychological, cognitive disturbances and quality of life in moderate-severe PHPT, while data in mild PHPT are less clear. At variance, the effect of parathyroidectomy on neuromuscular and articular complications is still unknown, and no studies demonstrated a reduction of cancer risk after recovery from PHPT. Overall, to date, cardiovascular and neuropsychological evaluation are not recommended solely because of PHPT, nor cardiovascular disease, muscle weakness, and neuropsychological complications are indication for parathyroidectomy.",Classical complications of primary hyperparathyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665547,Best practice & research.

However, new imagining techniques have highlighted deterioration of skeletal tissue in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism not captured by traditional DXA measurement. Concerning the kidney, the most common consequences of excessive parathyroid hormone secretion are hypercalciuria and kidney stones; however, the exact pathogenesis of urinary stone formation is still unknown. The 2013 International Congress on the management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism, emphasized the role of imaging techniques for early discovery of both skeletal and renal complications in asymptomatic patients. Gastrointestinal manifestations include acid-peptic disease, constipation, pancreatitis and gall stone disease.

These syndromic and non-syndromic forms have received benefits from the identification of the responsible genes whose mutations account for the genetic susceptibility to develop parathyroid tumours as also other endocrine and nonendocrine tumours. In recent years, care options have been made available to patients and families with hereditary PHPT, and the process of systematically assessing the genetic risk has been becoming increasingly important. The aim of this review is to help health providers not frequently dealing with genetic testing use, introducing general concepts with regard to genetic diagnosis issues. The role and the practical usefulness of DNA-based diagnosis in patients affected by different forms of ""congenital"" PHPT is described, closely looking on why, when and how genetic testing should be performed in these subjects and their relatives. Moreover, this review will provide some practical suggestions and recommendations concerning on how to deal with a suspected or known case of familial PHPT.","Impact of a homeopathic medication on upper respiratory tract infections in COPD patients: Results of an observational, prospective study (EPOXILO).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665525,Respiratory medicine,2019 01 22,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disorder in which airflow is obstructed. Viral or bacterial upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) may lead to exacerbations. Homeopathic medication administration to COPD patients during the influenza-exposure period may help to reduce the frequency of common URTIs.,The impact of disease-specific fears on outcome measures of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665524,Respiratory medicine,2019 01 22,"Anxiety is a highly prevalent psychological comorbidity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has detrimental effects on pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) outcomes. It has been suggested that disease-specific fears could play an even more important role in COPD patients' disease progression. However, little is known about how different disease-specific fears impact COPD. This study examined how different disease-specific fears relate to different PR outcome measures in COPD patients and how these relationships evolve over the course of PR. Before and after a 3-week inpatient PR program, COPD patients (N = 104) underwent a 6-min walking test to measure functional exercise capacity. Disease-specific fears (fear of physical activity, fear of dyspnea, fear of disease progression, fear of social exclusion) were assessed with the COPD-Anxiety-Questionnaire-Revised. Health-related quality of life (HQoL), COPD health status, dyspnea in daily life, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated questionnaires. Multiple regression showed that greater disease-specific fears at the start of PR were associated with worse functional exercise capacity, HQoL, health status, and depression at the start and end of PR (controlling for age, sex, lung function, smoking status, and general anxiety). Patients who showed a stronger decrease in disease-specific fears improved more in PR outcome measures over the course of PR. Furthermore, different disease-specific fears were related to different PR outcome measures. The results show that disease-specific fears are associated with treatment outcome measures, both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Therefore, disease-specific fears should be addressed in COPD patients as they might play a significant role in disease progression.",Utility of fiber-optic bronchoscopy in pulmonary infections among abdominal solid-organ transplant patients: A comprehensive review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665523,Respiratory medicine,2019 01 22,"Pulmonary infections are frequent complications in abdominal solid-organ transplantation (aSOT) which may threaten patient and allograft survival. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infections in this population can be challenging. Immunosuppressive therapy not only increases the risk of acquiring opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections, but it also impairs the inflammatory responses associated with microbial invasion which in an otherwise normal host produce clinical and radiologic responses that allow for early identification of the offending pathogen. Serologic testing is not a reliable diagnostic modality. Direct microbiological sampling is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis early in the clinical course to optimize timely, targeted therapy while reducing the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance, and minimize adverse effects of therapy, if any. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB) offers such diagnostic advantage and possesses a potential therapeutic value too. This comprehensive review discusses the potential benefits of FOB alongside its risks and complications, indications and contraindications, and techniques.

The claudin family in mammals consists of 27 four-transmembrane domain proteins. Claudins are responsible for the paracellular barrier function of TJs, and in some cases confer paracellular channel functions to the paracellular barriers of TJs. Based on recent breakthroughs in the molecular structure of claudins, the hypothetical 'antiparallel double row model' was proposed, which suggests how claudins polymerize in a linear fashion and form TJ strands with paracellular barrier and channel functions. Meanwhile, ongoing studies at the cell and tissue levels are clarifying how the paracellular barrier and/or channel functions of claudin-based TJs, which are both robust and flexible, organize various biological systems.",Sinonasal and Laryngeal Sarcoidosis-An Uncommon Presentation and Management Challenge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665498,The American journal of the medical sciences,2019 01 22,"Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of uncertain etiology characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas. The thorax is involved in 95% of cases, but any organ can be involved. Sinonasal or laryngeal involvement is uncommon and can be difficult to diagnose. The reported incidence of sarcoidosis in the upper airway clearly depends on study characteristics, and this creates uncertainty about the actual incidence. In a large prospective study in the United States, upper respiratory tract involvement occurred in 3% of the patients. Some patients have upper airway involvement without thoracic disease, and this presentation may cause delays in diagnosis. These patients have nonspecific symptoms which range from minimal nasal stuffiness to life-threatening upper airway obstruction. Currently, there is no established standard therapy for the management of upper airway sarcoidosis. These patients often respond poorly to nasal and/or inhaled corticosteroids and require long courses of oral corticosteroids. Patients with poor responses to oral corticosteroids or severe side effects may respond to tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors.

Given their potential as a life-saving therapy, an increasing number of people receive an ICD every year, and a growing number are currently living with ICDs. However, cardiopulmonary arrest serves as the final common pathway of natural death, and the appropriate management of an ICD near the end-of-life is crucial to ensure that a patient's death is not marked by further suffering due to ICD shocks. The tenets of palliative care at the end-of-life include addressing any medical intervention that may preclude dying with dignity; thus, management of ICDs during this phase is necessary. Internists are at the forefront of discussions about end-of-life care, and are likely to find discussions about ICD care at the end-of-life particularly challenging. The present review addresses issues pertaining to ICDs near the end of a patient's life and their potential impact on dying patients and their families. A multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach can ensure that patients receive the maximum benefit from ICDs, without any unintended pain or suffering.","Long Noncoding RNA Antisense Noncoding RNA in the INK4 Locus Correlates With Risk, Severity, Inflammation and Infliximab Efficacy in Crohn's Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665494,The American journal of the medical sciences,2019 01 22,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association of intestinal mucosa long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) expression with disease risk, activity and inflammatory cytokines levels of Crohn's disease (CD).",Epidemiology of Sarcopenia and Factors Associated With It Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults in Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665493,The American journal of the medical sciences,2019 01 22,Sarcopenia is a well-recognized geriatric syndrome.

We analyzed the seroprevalence and risk factors for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis in populations with high-risk behaviors in Croatia. During a three-year period, a total of 443 men who have sex with men (MSM) / bisexual persons, sex workers (SW) / clients of SW, persons with multiple sexual partners, and persons with a history of STD were tested for the presence of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Treponema pallidum (syphilis) antibodies within the framework of second generation HIV surveillance. Participants were recruited from 11 Croatian counties, the vast majority among clients of voluntary counselling and testing centers. The overall prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, and syphilis was 1.4%, 2.6%, 12.1%, and 3.4%, respectively. HBV and syphilis seroprevalence differed significantly between, genders with higher prevalence among men (anti-HBc 13.8% vs. 5.7%, P=0.043; syphilis 4.4% vs. 0%; P=0.049), as well as between age groups, with a steady increase according to age. Participants with a history of STD were more often seropositive than participants who did not report STD (HBsAg 8.2% vs. 1.0%, P=0.002; anti-HBc 32.4% vs. 6.4%, P<0.001; syphilis 12.0% vs. 1.7%, P<0.001). Syphilis seroprevalence was higher in homo / bisexual persons (12.2%) compared with heterosexual persons (1.2%, P<0.001). Logistic regression showed that history of STD was a significant risk factor for hepatitis B (HBsAg AOR=6.229, 95% CI=1.491-26.022; anti-HBc AOR=5.872, 95% CI=2.899-11.896) and syphilis seropositivity (AOR=5.572, 95% CI=1.751-17.726), while homo / bisexual behavior was associated with syphilis seropositivity (AOR=12.820, 95% CI=3.688-44.557). Our results highlight the importance of continuing STDs screening and prevention in at-risk populations.",Nail Involvements as an Indicator of Skin Lesion Severity in Psoriatic Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665480,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,2019 05 20,"Psoriasis is a recurrent chronic inflammatory skin disease with various mild to severe clinical manifestations. The relationship between severity of the skin lesions and nail involvement has always been underestimated. Aim of the study was to evaluate the severity of skin involvement in psoriatic patients with and without nail manifestations. In this analytic cross-sectional study, patients with psoriasis referred to Razi University Hospital of Rasht from November 2015 to March 2016 were enrolled. Demographical features (i.e. age, gender) were obtained. Psoriasis severity and nail involvement criteria were assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), respectively. All the gathered data were analyzed by SPSS software. In this study, 71 psoriatic patients with a mean age of 39.23±17.9 years (mean ± Standard Deviation; range: 4 to 77 years old) were studied. 22 patients (31%) had nail involvements. PASI scores were 11.7±5.7 and 5.7±4.5 in the two groups with and without nail involvements, respectively (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between age, age of onset, and duration of the disease between the two groups (P>0.05).The correlation coefficient between PASI and NAPSI was 0.367, which was statistically significant (P<0.001). Based on the findings of our study, nail involvement is an important criterion in determining the severity of skin manifestations in psoriatic patients. Additionally, a high percentage of such patients probably manifest both skin and nail manifestations. Therefore it is highly recommended to consider nail involvement when evaluating psoriasis.",Two Cases of Proximal Subungual Onychomycosis Caused by Trichophyton rubrum in HIV-negative Patients During Treatment with TNF-α Inhibitors Combined with Methotrexate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665479,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,2019 05 20,Proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO) is a rare subtype of onychomycosis with a clinical presentation characterized by proximal leukonychia in the lunular area of the nail.

Although the connection between AD and psychological stress has been known for a long time, there is a lack of reliable and objective indicators for the characterization of this association. Psychological stress triggers complex immune pathways. Therefore, acute stress quickly triggers a high release of cortisol and adrenalin or noradrenalin which then stimulates the immune system, primarily T-helper type 1 (Th1 cells) to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a cellular immune response and inflammation. On the other hand, chronic stress increases basal cortisol levels and decreases the capacity to mount an acute stress response, with the immune system shifting from a cellular response (which is active in acute stress) to a humoral response. Furthermore, skin keratinocytes contain receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones (muscarinic, adrenergic, glucocorticosteroid, androgenic, estrogenic), thus actively participating in psychoneuroimmunological pathways. The measurement of plasmatic cortisol has been used routinely, but in recent years, particularly in research, preference has been given to measurement of salivary cortisol. Reliable psychological tests are an important additional parameter for assessment of a patient's psychological state. We hope that future studies will supplement our current knowledge on the influence of psychological stress in AD.",Hidradenitis Suppurativa is Associated with Higher Heart Rate but Not Atrial Fibrillation: A Comparative Cross-sectional Study of 462 Individuals with Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Denmark.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665477,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,2019 05 20,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatological disease with inflammatory mechanisms overlapping those of psoriasis, and both diseases have been associated with cardiovascular risk factors i.e. smoking and metabolic syndrome. Two studies have recently linked psoriasis with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). AF is the most frequently occurring cardiac arrhythmia in the general population and is typically accompanied by increased heart rate. Both AF and heart rate are linked with inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate a potential association between HS and increased heart rate as well as AF. We performed a comparative cross-sectional study using digital measurements of heart rate and resting 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in combination with self-reported information when diagnosing AF. Our study comprised 32 individuals with HS from the hospital (the hospital HS group), 430 from the general population HS group (the population HS group), and 20,780 controls. Age and sex adjusted analysis demonstrated a significantly higher heart rate in the HS groups vs. controls (15% (range: 8-23%) higher for the hospital HS group and 4% (2-5%) higher for the population HS group). We found no association between HS and AF (P=0.1670).","Evaluation of Ear, Nose, and Throat Involvement in Pemphigus Vulgaris in Comparison with Pemphigus Severity Scoring Systems: A Cross-sectional Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665476,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,2019 05 20,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) frequently affects the mucous membranes of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT). Since ENT examination is not a routinely performed procedure, the exact involvement of PV remains unrecognized. The available severity scoring systems (Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) and Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS)) for PV do not include a full ENT examination. This study was designed to evaluate the real extent of PV in ENT areas and to find out the specific scores which indicate the need for ENT examination. The patients were evaluated for ENT manifestations by endoscopic examination whether or not they exhibited symptoms. PDAI, ABSIS, and ENT scores were calculated, and the results were compared for correlation and significance. The mucosal involvement was more severe when scored by ENT examination than when assessed by PDAI or ABSIS. The ENT score was significantly associated with symptoms and endoscopic findings, especially when PDAI ≥15 and/or ABSIS ≥17. ENT endoscopic examination could result in more accurate grading in PV. In particular, performing such an examination should be considered in patients, especially when PDAI ≥15 and/or ABSIS ≥17, regardless of ENT symptoms.",Correlates of perceived death competence: What role does meaning-in-life and quality-of-life play?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665475,Palliative & supportive care,2019 01 22,"Understanding factors that are associated with more adaptive death attitudes and competencies can inspire future health-promoting palliative care strategies and inform approaches to training and development for health professionals.

To date, limited therapeutic achievements targeting cell proliferation and related mechanisms has led researchers to focus on the microenvironment where pancreatic cancers develop. The anomalous proliferation of stromal cells, such as pancreatic stellate cells, and an increased deposition of altered matrix proteins create an environment that facilitates tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance. Here, we summarize our understanding of recent advances in research about the role of fibrosis in pancreatic cancer progression, with particular emphasize on the involvement of fibrotic machineries such as wound healing, extra cellular matrix degradation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The precise influence of these mechanisms on the biological behaviors and growth of cancer cells has great impact on clinical therapy and therefore deserves more attention. We also discuss the role of various stromal components in conferring drug resistance to PDAC which further worsening the pessimistic disease prognosis. A more in depth understanding of cancer-stroma crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment and stroma based clinical and translational therapies may provide new therapeutic strategies for the prevention of pancreatic cancer progression.","Risk factors of mental disorders among empty and non-empty nesters in Shanxi, China: a cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665409,Health and quality of life outcomes,2019 02 15,China has the world's largest size of elderly population.

Women are more frequently exposed to several stressors during their reproductive age that trigger generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accumulation of ROS in the body causes oxidative stress (OS) and adversely affects ovarian functions. The increased OS triggers various cell death pathways in the ovary. Beside apoptosis and autophagy, OS trigger necroptosis in granulosa cell as well as in follicular oocyte. The OS could activate receptor interacting protein kinase-1(RIPK1), receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) to trigger necroptosis in mammalian ovary. The granulosa cell necroptosis may deprive follicular oocyte from nutrients, growth factors and survival factors. Under these conditions, oocyte becomes more susceptible towards OS-mediated necroptosis in the follicular oocytes. Induction of necroptosis in encircling granulosa cell and oocyte may lead to follicular atresia. Indeed, follicular atresia is one of the major events responsible for the elimination of majority of germ cells from cohort of ovary. Thus, the inhibition of necroptosis could prevent precautious germ cell depletion from ovary that may cause reproductive senescence and early menopause in several mammalian species including human.",Prevalence of bovine fascioliasis and economic impact associated with liver condemnation in abattoirs in Mongu district of Zambia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665406,BMC veterinary research,2019 01 25,"Fascioliasis is a trematode zoonotic snail-borne disease of public health and economic importance.

The severity of the injury is dependent on the time the tissue was restricted from blood flow, becoming more severe after longer ischemia times. This can lead to many complications such as tissue necrosis, cellular apoptosis, inflammation, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, and even organ failure. One of the emerging therapies to combat ischemic reperfusion injury complications is hydrogen sulfide, which is a gasotransmitter that diffuses across cell membranes to exert effects on various signaling pathways regulating cell survival such as Akt, mitochondrial activity, and apoptosis. Although commonly thought of as a toxic gas, low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide have been shown to be beneficial in promoting tissue survival post-ischemia, and modulate a wide variety of cellular responses. This review will detail the mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide in affecting the Akt signaling pathway, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis, particularly in regards to ischemic reperfusion injury in muscle tissue.

This study analyzed the effect of 16 minutes of monitored cooperative high-intensity interval training (monitored C-HIIT) at the start of the school day, on various cognitive variables over the next 24-48 hours. We randomly assigned 158 participants either to a control group ( n = 81) that engaged only in static stretching or to an experimental group ( n = 77) that performed monitored C-HIIT. We assessed cognitive functioning before the exercise, immediately afterward, and for five follow-up time points over the next two days (i.e., at 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 hours). We analyzed age, sex, body mass index, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as potential confounder variables. Adolescents in the monitored C-HIIT group increased selective attention by 17.39% during the next hour ( p = .015) and increased concentration by 20.31% and 15.26% during the first ( p = .022) and second ( p = .059) subsequent hours, respectively. This positive short-term benefit of monitored C-HIIT during immediate subsequent hours is an important finding with implications for the school curricula and schedule."

HIF-1α is specific for the hypoxia response, and its degradation mediated by three enzymes EGLN1, EGLN2 and EGLN3. Although EGLNs expression has been found to be related to prognosis of many cancers, few studies examined DNA methylation in EGLNs and its relationship to prognosis of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed EGLNs DNA methylation data from tumor tissue samples of 1,230 early-stage NSCLC patients, as well as gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The sliding windows sequential forward feature selection method and weighted random forest were used to screen out the candidate CpG probes in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinomas patients, respectively, in both discovery and validation phases. Then Cox regression was performed to evaluate the association between DNA methylation and overall survival. Among the 34 CpG probes in EGLNs, DNA methylation at cg25923056EGLN2 was identified to be significantly associated with LUAD survival (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, P = 9.90 × 10-5), and correlated with EGLN2 expression (r = - 0.36, P = 1.52 × 10-11). Meanwhile, EGLN2 expression was negatively correlated with HIF1A expression in tumor tissues (r = - 0.30, P = 4.78 × 10-8) and significantly (P = 0.037) interacted with HIF1A expression on overall survival. Therefore, DNA methylation of EGLN2- HIF1A is a potential marker for LUAD prognosis and these genes are potential treatment targets for further development of HIF-1α inhibitors in lung cancer therapy.",Neck and Shoulder Motor Function following Neck Dissection: A Comparison with Healthy Control Subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665326,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 06 03,"To compare the neck and shoulder motor function of patients following neck dissection, including comparison with a group of healthy volunteers.",Peripheral Vestibulopathy Presenting as Acute Vertigo and Spontaneous Nystagmus with Negative Video Head Impulse Test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665325,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 05 01,To analyze acute vertigo showing spontaneous nystagmus with negative video head impulse test (vHIT).,Cyberbullying and Victimization and Youth Suicide Risk: The Buffering Effects of School Connectedness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665324,The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses,2019 01 22,"Bullying has been linked to adolescent suicidal behavior.

Data were from 93 adolescents participating in a longitudinal study of an intervention to prevent health-risk behavior including suicidal behavior. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine the influence of cyberbullying and school connectedness on adolescent suicidal behavior. Findings indicated that being a victim of cyberbullying, but not a perpetrator, was associated with increased risk of suicide and that connections to school moderated this relationship in that, among youth who were victims of cyberbullying, those more connected to school were less likely to report suicidal behavior.

These types of memories provide information about solutions and experiences from the past that can be utilized as examples in the present when seeking solutions to any problem.

This study aims to elaborate a structural equations model that empirically supports the relationships among the executive functions, episodic autobiographical memory, and the adaptive capacity to solve problems, taking into account the depressed mood state. In all, 32 healthy elderly people, 32 patients with Parkinson disease, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and 32 with Alzheimer disease were evaluated. Structural equation models were estimated to test the effects among the constructs. The final model shows adequate fit indexes, thus revealing that an individual's problem-solving capacity will depend on the capacity to access the episodic autobiographical memory, which in turn will depend on the maintenance of executive functioning. In a parallel way, the mood state, and specifically depression, will play a modulator role because when there is depressive symptomatology, some capacities that depend on executive control can be diminished.",Surgical management of esophageal perforation: role of primary closure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665318,Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,2019 04 22,"Esophageal perforation is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality and morbidity.

We propose that a stanna-Brook rearrangement plays a fundamental role in the formation of the polycyclic organotin acetals obtained. These unusual compounds could be further functionalized by tin-lithium exchange followed by alkylation of the newly formed tertiary carbanion. Alternatively, dialkylated aromatic hydrocarbons have been prepared via a decarbonilation reaction promoted by Me3SnLi. 1,4-Aromatic diesters were reductively dialkylated and then transformed into norbornadienone derivatives by reaction with Me3SnLi. Several stable dibenzonorbornadienones 41 have been prepared in just two steps starting from anthracene 38. The corresponding naphthalene analogues gave 1,4-dialkylnaphthalenes.

A simple method is described for simultaneously extracting both the hydrogen-bonding equilibrium constants and the rate constants for the PCET event from deconvolution of the luminescence quenching data. These experiments confirm that these activations occur in a concerted fashion, wherein the proton and electron are transferred to the ketone substrate in a single elementary step. The rates constants for the PCET events were linearly correlated with their driving forces over a range of nearly 19 kcal/mol. However, the slope of the rate-driving force relationship deviated significantly from expectations based on Marcus theory. A rationalization for this observation is proposed based on the principle of non-perfect synchronization, wherein factors that serve to stabilize the product are only partially realized at the transition state.

The relationship existing between the composition, processing parameters and physical properties of the fibers has been disclosed by analyzing how the industrial process induced changes at the macromolecular level, i.e., the chain microstructure and crystallinity development. A poly(l-lactide) and three copolymers having trimethylene carbonate contents of 5, 10 and 18 mol % were synthesized with high molecular weight ( Mn) up to 377 kDa and narrow dispersity. Their microstructure, crystallinity and thermal properties were dictated by the composition. The spinnability was then assessed for all the as-polymerized materials: four melt-spun multifilament fibers with increasing linear density were collected for each (co)polymer at a fixed take-up speed of 1800 m min-1 varying the mass throughput during the extrusion. A linear correlation resulted between the as-spun fiber properties and the linear density. The as-spun fibers could be further oriented, developing more crystallinity and improving their tensile properties by a second stage of hot-drawing. This ability was dependent on the composition and crystallinity achieved during the melt-spinning and the parameters selected for the hot-drawing, such as temperature, draw ratio and input speed. The crystalline structure evolved to a more stable form, and the degree of crystallinity increased from 0-52% to 25-66%.

Despite the great developments of some advanced characterization techniques, it remains challenging to achieve fast and sensitive determination of micellar transitions in solution. Herein, a novel indicator system for micellar transitions was developed based on the micelle-mediated peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence that showed a sensitive response toward the changes of micellar morphologies. A peroxyoxalate derivative and a fluorophore were first coassembled into the hydrophobic cavities of micelles of the typical cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). A strong and rapidly falling chemiluminescence response was exhibited in spherical micelles as a result of the loose arrangement of CTAB molecules. By contrast, rodlike or wormlike micelles transformed from spherical micelles could induce a compact arrangement of CTAB molecules, leading to a weak chemiluminescence emission with a slow decay rate. The practicability and universality of the chemiluminescent indicator were demonstrated by determining the micellar transitions in a variety of surfactant solutions (ionic, nonionic, and polymeric). These findings open attractive perspectives for the practice of chemiluminescence technique in micelle characterization.",Photoredox-Catalyzed Intermolecular Radical Arylthiocyanation/Arylselenocyanation of Alkenes: Access to Aryl-Substituted Alkylthiocyanates/Alkylselenocyanates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665295,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 03 15,"An efficient and highly selective approach for intermolecular arylthiocyanation/arylselenocyanation of alkenes has been reported under mild conditions.

Experimental and observational studies with concurrent comparator promoting EBF, conducted in LMICs with high country rates of breastfeeding initiation, were included. Studies were identified from a systematic review and PUBMED, Cochrane, and CABI databases. Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were carried out independently and in duplicate. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for individual studies and pooled. High heterogeneity was explored through prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary outcome (EBF until 6 months) by context and by intervention for the randomized controlled trials. Prediction intervals were calculated for each effect estimate. Sixty-seven studies with 79 comparisons from 30 LMICs were included.

We aim to investigate the relationship between circadian genes polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk based on data from the EPICAP study, a population-based case-control study including 1,515 men (732 cases / 783 controls) with genotyped data. Odds Ratios (ORs) for association between prostate cancer and circadian gene variants were estimated for each of the 872 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 31 circadian clock genes. We also used a gene-based and pathway-based approach with a focus on the pathway including 9 core circadian genes. Separate analyses were conducted by prostate cancer aggressiveness. The core-circadian pathway (p = 0.0006) was significantly associated to prostate cancer, for either low (p = 0.002) or high (p = 0.01) grade tumor. At the gene level, we observed significant associations between all prostate cancer and NPAS2 and PER1 after correcting for multiple testing, while only RORA was significant for aggressive tumors. At the SNP-level, no significant association was observed. Our findings provide additional evidence of a potential link between genetic variants in circadian genes and prostate cancer risk.

Part A,2019 03 28,"Nonviral delivery of plasmid (p)DNA or messenger (m)RNA is a safe and promising therapeutic option to continuously supply therapeutic proteins into diseased tissues. In most cases of in vivo pDNA and mRNA delivery, these nucleic acids are loaded into carriers based on cationic polymers and/or lipids to prevent nuclease-mediated degradation before reaching target cells. The carriers should also evade host clearance mechanisms, including uptake by scavenger cells and filtration in the spleen. Installation of ligands onto the carriers can facilitate their rapid uptake into target cells. Meanwhile, carrier toxicity should be minimized not only for preventing undesirable adverse responses in patients, but also for preserving the function of transfected cells to exert therapeutic effects. Long-term progressive improvement of platform technologies has helped overcome most of these issues, though some still remain hindering the widespread clinical application of nonviral pDNA and mRNA delivery. This review discusses design concepts of nonviral carriers for in vivo delivery and the issues to be overcome, focusing especially on our own efforts using polyplex micelles. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We sought to describe the impact of whole exome sequencing (WES), which has only recently become widely available clinically, on molecular diagnosis in the Nationwide Children's Hospital Neuromuscular clinics. We reviewed records of all patients in our clinic with pediatric onset of symptoms who had WES done since 2013. Patients were included if clinical suspicion was high for a neuromuscular disease. Clinical WES was performed in 30 families, representing 31 patients, all of whom were seen for hypotonia, weakness, or gait disturbance. Probands had between 2 and 12 genetic diagnostic tests prior to obtaining WES. A genetic diagnosis was established in 11 families (37%), and in 12 patients (39%), with mutations in 10 different genes. Five of these genes have only been associated with disease since 2013, and were not previously represented on clinically available disease gene panels.

Then, we considered that treatment with rhsTM may show therapeutic effects even when administered in the ischaemic delayed phase, because rhsTM has an action of inhibiting high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation. This study was performed to investigate the effects of delayed treatment with rhsTM on ischaemic brain damage induced by high HMGB1 level in mice subjected to 4-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). One day after MCAO, rhsTM was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 or 5 mg/kg once a day for 7 days. Neurological score, motor coordination and HMGB1 levels were measured 1, 3 and 7 days after MCAO. The presence of activated microglia was evaluated 7 days after MCAO. Systemic HMGB1 levels increased 1 to 7 days after MCAO and were higher at 7 days compared with day 1. At the same time, survival rate decreased, and activated microglia increased in the infarct area. Treatment with rhsTM improved neurological score, motor coordination, survival and prevented brain damage. Moreover, rhsTM decreased both HMGB1 level and number of activated M1 microglia. The results of this study indicated that rhsTM improved functional outcomes via inhibition of HMGB1 up-regulation and M1 microglial activation in the cerebral ischaemic delayed phase. rhsTM may become a new therapeutic agent with a wide therapeutic time window in patients with cerebral ischaemia.",Renal Transplantation and Survival Among Patients With Lupus Nephritis: A Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665236,Annals of internal medicine,2019 02 06,Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to lupus nephritis (LN) have high rates of premature death.,"Selective Ablation of Megalin in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium Results in Megaophthalmos, Macromelanosome Formation and Severe Retina Degeneration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665232,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2019 01 28,"Mutations in the megalin-encoding gene, LRP2, cause high myopia as seen in patients suffering from Donnai-Barrow/facio-oculo-acoustico-renal syndrome.

To address this problem, the short-foot exercise (SFE) may be used. However, there has been no previous research on the neurosensory impact of SFE. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess improvement of quantitative neurosensory indicators after SFE and to determine the effect of proprioceptive sensory exercise (PSE) in patients with CAI. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study included 30 adults (age range: 19-29 years; 50% female). Selection criteria for CAI (Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool £24) were implemented, and participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: SFE (n1=15) and PSE (n2=15). Exercises were conducted 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Measurements of quantitative somatosensory of joint position sense and vibration sensory thresholds, dynamic balance, and ankle instability assessment were evaluated before and after completion of each intervention. Data were analyzed using a repeated- measures analysis of variance. RESULTS In a time-by-group comparison, the SFE group showed a more significant improvement with regards to eversion joint position sense (F1,28=4.543, p<0.05). For vibration sensory threshold, the SFE group showed a more significant improvement (F1,28=8.280, p<0.01). Balance index according to anterio-posterior, mediolateral, and overall index the SFE group a more significant improvement (F1,28=6.666, 4.585, 5.207, p<0.05). And ankle instability SFE group showed a more significant improvement (F1,28=6.890, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS SFE is more effective than PSE for treating ankle sprain patients. There is a need to develop and promote an effective and controlled exercise program to facilitate the return of ankle sprain patients to normal daily life."

Gastrointestinal diseases related acromegaly such as colon cancers, adenomatous polyps, and dolichocolon are much less known. We aimed to present a case of complete colonic volvulus in a patient with acromegaly. A 60-year-old male patient presented with the complaints of inability to pass gas or stool, worsening distension, and pain for one week. The clinical exam showed significant tenderness and distended abdomen as well as a typical appearance of acromegaly. In his past medical history, he underwent an operation of pituitary adenoma with the diagnosis of acromegaly. He also underwent a sigmoid colon resection due to dolichocolon detected by abdominal computerized tomography (CT) and colonoscopy. Upright abdominal X-ray was compatible with volvulus, so endoscopic distortion was tried but failed. At exploration, entire colon was extremely dilated and had a necrotic appearance, and observed to be twisted 360 degrees around its mesenteric axis. The patient underwent total colectomy and end ileostomy. Pathology result was reported as necrotic and hemorrhagic colon with 150 cm in length and 20 cm in width. The patient was discharged on the 14th postoperative day without complications. GH and IGF-1 have an irreversible effect on colonic collagen synthesis in acromegaly and has been proposed to be correlated with the presence of dolichocolon. Dolichocolon often can lead to an abnormal rotation, volvulus, and development of Chilaiditi syndrome. The occurrence of volvulus including the whole colon, although the pituitary adenoma was treated and partial colectomy was done, refers to predisposing factor being the irreversible effect of acromegaly on the colon.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 03 04,"Mean-field density functional theory can be used to estimate the free energy of non-uniform fluids. The second functional derivative with respect to density of the free energy is related to the direct correlation function of the fluid and, in principle, this can be inverted to find an improved approximation for the pair correlation function and hence the free energy, the so-called 'random phase approximation'. If the repulsive molecular interaction is approximated by the local density approximation and the attractive interaction is assumed to be of the Yukawa form, the problem reduces to that of finding the eigenvalues of Schrödinger-like equations, which, for certain models (such as the 'Φ4 model'), can be done analytically in the planar case. The relationship between this approach and field theoretical treatment of the vapour-liquid interface is discussed. The ultraviolet divergence of the expression can be eliminated by separating the first term in the expansion, although quantitative results still depend on the behaviour of the attractive potential in the repulsive core. In the case of a spherical droplet of radius R, correction terms to the free energy involving lnR appear due to (i) cluster translational invariance, (ii) the unstable mode corresponding to droplet growth, and (iii) capillary waves. The net effect of these terms is to modify the classical expression for the nucleation rate by a factor proportional to R 4/3.",Preparation and application performance study of biomass-based carbon materials with various morphologies by a hydrothermal/soft template method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665209,Nanotechnology,2019 02 22,"Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with controllable morphologies were prepared via a soft template method using chitosan as the carbon and nitrogen source and F127 or ionic liquid as the template. The performance of the materials as electrodes and adsorbents for carbon dioxide removal were evaluated. Carbon spheres (CSs) with developed micropore structures were obtained without a template, whereas a tubular structure (CSF) containing mesopores with long-range order was obtained using F127. Layered carbon (CSI) containing micro-/mesopores with short- and long-range order was obtained using an ionic liquid. The samples exhibited graphite-like structure and the soft template increased the graphitization degree. Nitrogen existed mainly in the form of pyridine and pyridone groups in CSs and CSF and as pyridine, pyridone, and quaternary groups in CSI. The specific capacitances of CSs, CSF, and CSI were 144, 161, and 178 F g-1, respectively, at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 in 1 M sulfuric acid. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of CSs, CSF, and CSI were 142, 73, and 115 mg g-1, respectively; CSs displayed the highest value because of its developed micro- and ultramicroporous structure.

Microscale studies of multispecies communities are lacking and it remains unclear how macroscale trends scale down to small groups of cells. Experimental approaches using microfluidic devices have revealed heterogeneity in the behavior of single cells, however, this analysis has not been extended towards the variability of cell-cell interactions. Using a microwell device, we analyzed cell growth within hundreds of replicate microbial communities consisting of two species and small population sizes. The wells of the devices were inoculated with a coculture of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Each species expressed a unique fluorescent protein enabling simultaneously tracking of cell number for each species over time. Growth dynamics within the device were consistent with bulk measurements. The device enabled monitoring of replicate, isolated coculture populations at high magnification, revealing both the growth interaction between the two species and the variability of such cell-cell interactions within small groups of cells. The device enables new experimental measurements of the heterogeneity of interactions within small, multispecies populations of bacteria."

How TRAIL protects against atherosclerosis and why levels are reduced in disease is unknown. Here, multiple strategies were used to identify the protective source of TRAIL and its mechanism(s) of action. Samples from patients with coronary artery disease and bone-marrow transplantation experiments in mice lacking TRAIL revealed monocytes/macrophages as the main protective source. Accordingly, deletion of TRAIL caused a more inflammatory macrophage with reduced migration, displaying impaired reverse cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis. Furthermore, interleukin (IL)-18, commonly increased in plasma of patients with cardiovascular disease, negatively regulated TRAIL transcription and gene expression, revealing an IL-18-TRAIL axis. These findings demonstrate that TRAIL is protective of atherosclerosis by modulating monocyte/macrophage phenotype and function. Manipulating TRAIL levels in these cells highlights a different therapeutic avenue in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",Tissue-Specific Chk1 Activation Determines Apoptosis by Regulating the Balance of p53 and p21.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665195,iScience,2019 02 28,"The DNA damage response (DDR) protects cells against genomic instability. Surprisingly, little is known about the differences in DDR across tissues, which may affect cancer evolutionary trajectories and chemotherapy response. Using mathematical modeling and quantitative experiments, we found that the DDR is regulated differently in human breast and lung primary cells. Equal levels of cisplatin-DNA lesions caused stronger Chk1 activation in lung cells, leading to resistance. In contrast, breast cells were more resistant and showed more Chk2 activation in response to doxorubicin. Further analyses indicate that Chk1 activity played a regulatory role in p53 phosphorylation, whereas Chk2 activity was essential for p53 activation and p21 expression. We propose a novel ""friction model,"" in which the balance of p53 and p21 levels contributes to the apoptotic response in different tissues. Our results suggest that modulating the balance of p53 and p21 dynamics could optimize the response to chemotherapy.",Low-Energy-Loss Polymer Solar Cells with 14.52% Efficiency Enabled by Wide-Band-Gap Copolymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665194,iScience,2019 02 23,"Two wide band-gap copolymers poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-butylhexylthio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-TZNT] (PBDTS-TZNT) and poly[4,8-bis(4-fluoro-5-(2-butylhexylthio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-TZNT] (PBDTSF-TZNT) based on naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(2-octyl-[1,2,3]triazole) (TZNT) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT) with different conjugated side chains have been developed for efficient nonfullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs).

Source sectors' dependent patterns of atmospheric concentrations of 9 organophosphate esters (OPEs), 9 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 5 novel flame retardants (NFRs) showed dominance of OPEs and PBDEs at highly commercialised urban and traffic sites, while NFRs, were dominant at residential sites. Overall, average concentrations of Σ9OPEs (1790 pg/m3) were two orders of magnitude higher than Σ9PBDEs (9.17 pg/m3) and Σ5NFRs (8.14 pg/m3). The atmospheric concentrations of given chemical classes also showed a general trend of lower levels in winter as compared to summer months. Statistically significant negative correlations between the natural logarithm of concentrations and inverse of temperature for some OPEs and PBDEs highlighted the role of volatilization from local sources at given sites as primarily influencing their atmospheric concentrations. Overall, this study adds to the current knowledge of urban settings as a major emitter of the chemicals of emerging concern and their replacements, as well as the ongoing problem of phased out PBDEs due to their presence in existing inventories of commercial/recycled products. It is recommended that long-term monitoring programs targeting flame retardants (FRs) include urban sites, which provide an early indicator of effectiveness of control measures of targeted FRs, while at the same time providing information on emission sources and trends of replacement FR chemicals.",Viruses in bats and potential spillover to animals and humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665189,Current opinion in virology,2019 04 22,"In the last two decades, several high impact zoonotic disease outbreaks have been linked to bat-borne viruses.

Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that protein O-glucosylation is essential for full Notch activity in Drosophila and mice. Aberrant protein O-glucosylation has been linked to human diseases. Structural studies of the glycosyltransferases, POGLUT1 and XXYLT1, in complex with substrates revealed the biosynthetic mechanisms of protein O-glucosylation. Very recently, two novel protein O-glucosyltransferases that modify sites distinct from POGLUT1 were identified. Furthermore, protein O-glucosylation turned out to modulate the stability of EGF repeats and thereby regulate Notch trafficking.","Unconscious arithmetic: Assessing the robustness of the results reported by Karpinski, Briggs, and Yale (2018).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665187,Consciousness and cognition,2019 02 04,"In 2012, a study by Sklar et al. reported that participants could solve invisible subtractions. This notion of unconscious arithmetic has been influential because it challenges current theories of consciousness. In 2016, Karpinski et al. published a direct replication reporting evidence for unconscious addition rather than subtraction. About a year later, the study was retracted due to a computation error in the analysis pipeline. After this error was corrected, no evidence for unconscious addition nor subtraction was obtained. Recently, Karpinski et al. republished the study by applying the exclusion criteria used in Sklar et al. The reanalysis found weak evidence for unconscious subtraction. To assess the robustness of these results, we examine how sensitive the results are to data analytic decisions. We outline a set of 250 analyses that we consider justified to perform. We show that none of the analyses indicates evidence for unconscious subtraction.",Biased belief in the Bayesian brain: A deeper look at the evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665186,Consciousness and cognition,2019 02 04,"A recent critique of hierarchical Bayesian models of delusion argues that, contrary to a key assumption of these models, belief formation in the healthy (i.e., neurotypical) mind is manifestly non-Bayesian. Here we provide a deeper examination of the empirical evidence underlying this critique. We argue that this evidence does not convincingly refute the assumption that belief formation in the neurotypical mind approximates Bayesian inference. Our argument rests on two key points. First, evidence that purports to reveal the most damning violation of Bayesian updating in human belief formation is counterweighted by substantial evidence that indicates such violations are the rare exception-not a common occurrence. Second, the remaining evidence does not demonstrate convincing violations of Bayesian inference in human belief updating; primarily because this evidence derives from study designs that produce results that are not obviously inconsistent with Bayesian principles."

Host sensitized Ln3+ emission was found to be present only in CdSe/Eu, CdSe/Tb, ZnS/Eu, ZnS/Tb and ZnS/Yb nanoparticles. In all the cases tuning of emission of the nanoparticles has been observed, irrespective of the presence or absence of host sensitization. The elemental compositions of CdSe and ZnS nanoparticles upon post-synthetic treatment show a remarkable difference. Incorporation of lanthanides in the nanoparticles is evident with significant alteration in the anionic content, and complete cation exchange of either Cd2+ or Zn2+ by Ln3+ has not been detected; as evaluated from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Further evaluation on this comes from considering thermodynamic parameters of inter cation interaction. In cases where the host sensitized Ln3+ emission have been observed, luminescence lifetime measurements reveal significant protection of Ln3+ in the nanoparticles. Noticeable difference in photophysical properties for a given Ln3+ has been realized in the two hosts. The photophysical observations have been rationalized using (i) charge trapping mediated host sensitized dopant emission, (ii) autoionization of excited electrons, and (iii) environment induced photoluminescence quenching. The post-synthetic modification discussed in the present work provides an easy and less synthetically demanding room temperature based protocol to avail lanthanide incorporated (doped) semiconductor nanoparticles that can potentially use the unique emission properties of the lanthanide cations.",Langmuir-Blodgett technique for anisotropic colloids: Young investigator perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665168,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 04,"Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique, which involves the formation of interfacial layers and the subsequent transfer onto a solid substrate, provides one of the most versatile means to characterize the adsorption, self-assembly, and rheological properties of interfacial colloids. In this review, we summarized the relevant studies on anisotropic colloids, which exhibit a richer self-assembly potential than their spherical counterparts. Hard particles with different shape and aspect ratio induce interfacial distortions when trapped at a liquid interface; the ensuing capillary interactions can drive the formation of complex two-dimensional (2D) structures with interesting properties. Soft colloids such as proteins, on the other hand, possess intrinsic anisotropy in both their shape and interactions. Exploring the shape/orientation dependent interactions and the created structures are important for diverse applications. Here, we present the comprehensive state of anisotropic colloids at liquid interfaces, and try to develop a deeper understanding of their self-assembly dynamics.",Rich liquid crystal phase behavior of novel alkyl-tri(ethylene glycol)-glucoside carbohydrate surfactants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665167,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 04,"Carbohydrates are appealing non-ionic surfactant head-groups as they are naturally abundant, generally biocompatible and biodegradable, and readily functionalized. Herein, we explore the phase behavior of seven novel carbohydrate-based surfactants (CBS) containing a tri-ethylene glycol (TEG) linker between a glucose head-group and alkyl tail-group, with linear saturated (C8-18) and cis-unsaturated (C18:1) alkyl chains. At high aqueous concentrations, these glycolipid-like surfactants transition into a variety of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases following an expected concentration phase sequence: hexagonal (H1) → bicontinuous cubic (V1) → lamellar (Lα). Using polarizing light microscopy (PLM), a binary (surfactant-water) phase diagram for each surfactant was constructed across a temperature range (25-80 °C) revealing thermotropic behavior and a broadening of liquid crystal phase regions with increasing alkyl chain length. There was also a significant difference between saturated and unsaturated alkyl chains, due to the cis-unsaturated 'statistical bend' lowering the melting point. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed to characterize the liquid crystal phases, identifying highly-ordered p6m,Ia3d, and Lα crystallographic space-groups with up to 7 resolved Bragg peaks, likely due to the highly anisometric nature of the TEG-linked surfactants. The phases were shown to be more numerous and exhibited greater thermal-stability compared to well-characterized alkyl glucoside surfactants lacking an oligoethylene spacer in the literature. Finally, the characteristic dimensions of each phase were determined to enable visualization of the internal microstructures, providing insight into the impact of molecular shape and the distribution of hydro-philicity/phobicity on the formation and stability of liquid crystalline mesophases.",2D-2D growth of NiFe LDH nanoflakes on montmorillonite for cationic and anionic dye adsorption performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665166,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 04,"NiFe layered double hydroxides nanoflakes decorated montmorillonite (MMT@NiFe LDH) was successfully prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The 2D-2D growth MMT@NiFe LDH was utilized as an effective adsorbent for removal of anionic dye of methyl orange (MO) and cationic dye of methylene blue (MB). The mole ratio of Ni2+/Fe3+ could quite influence the interlayer spacing, surface area per unit charge and the ultrathin hexagonal laminated morphology of NiFe LDH decorated on the surface of MMT. Various characterization techniques were conducted to identify it, such as XRD, FT-IR, TG-DTA, BET, XPS and SEM. Under the optimal conditions, the Langmuir-fitted maximum adsorption capacities for MO and MB are 108.80 mg g-1 and 99.18 mg g-1, respectively. Adsorption kinetics for MO and MB are both verified to be fit in with pseudo-second-order model.

Here, carbon-coated cobalt sulfide nanostructures are fabricated with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone during hydrothermal process. The morphology of carbon-coated cobalt sulfide can evolve from well-defined uniform nanooctahedrons, nanoflowers to nanospheres by simply controlling the polyvinylpyrrolidone amount. Remarkably, the unique carbon-coated cobalt sulfide configuration takes full advantage of the synergistic contributions from both the homogeneous incorporated carbon layer and the ideal hierarchical flowerlike structures, thereby making it to be a suitable electrode for supercapacitors. By virtue of the intriguing structural features of carbon-coated cobalt sulfide, a solid asymmetric supercapacitor based on carbon-coated cobalt sulfide nanoflowers as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode achieves remarkable cycling stability (around 86% capacitance retention even up to 10,000 times), and outstanding energy density of 40 Wh kg-1 at power density of 850 W kg-1. The exceptionably electrochemical performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor is related to the enhanced electrical conductivity and increased electrode/electrolyte contact area of carbon-coated cobalt sulfide. Thus, the as-prepared carbon-coated cobalt sulfide nanoflowers is demonstrated to be a promising electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors."

Existing studies, however, present a puzzling picture. On the one hand, infants distinguish between intentional and accidental actions. On the other hand, previous work suggests that until 8 years of age children do not yet understand an essential property of intentions-their aspectuality. Intentions are aspectual in the sense that they refer to objects and actions only under specific aspects. For example, Oedipus married Jocasta without knowing that she was his mother. Thus, he intentionally married Jocasta but did not intentionally marry his mother. However, the negative findings from these studies may indicate performance limitations rather than competence limitations. The rationale of the current set of studies, therefore, was to test children's understanding of the aspectuality of intentions in a simplified, cognitively less demanding design. The participants, 5- and 6-year-olds (Study 1) and 4-year-olds (Study 2), were involved in simple games where they (or another agent) intentionally acted on objects that had an obvious first identity and a hidden second identity. Children either did or did not know about the toy's second identity at the moment of acting. After their actions, children were asked about their intentions regarding the toys' different identities. Results revealed that the 5- and 6-year-olds, but not the 4-year-olds, systematically considered how they (or another agent) represented the objects when making intentionality judgments. Thus, an understanding of aspectual intentions seems to develop at around the late preschool years-much earlier than previously assumed.",Making a bridge between general hospital and specialised community-based treatment for alcohol use disorder-A pragmatic randomised controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665152,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 04 25,To investigate if more patients in the intervention group attended specialized alcohol treatment compared with a treatment-as-usual group (TAU).,"Changing risk and presentation of overdose associated with consumption of street drugs at a supervised injection site in Vancouver, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665151,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 04 25,"British Columbia is experiencing a public health emergency due to overdoses resulting from consumption of street drugs contaminated with fentanyl.

The in vitro cytotoxicity experiment showed that the as-developed nanocomplex was able to induce greater cytotoxicity in KB human nasopharyngeal cancer cells compared to free cisplatin at the same concentration. Moreover, the interaction of ACA and laser irradiation acted synergistically and resulted in higher cell death rate compared to separate application of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy. The micrograph of KB cells also revealed that ACA was able to selectively accumulate into the mitochondria, so that laser irradiation of KB cells pre-treated with ACA resulted in intensive morphological damages such as plasma membrane disruption, chromatin condensation, autophagic vacuoles formation and organelle degeneration. Moreover, the sign and magnitude of optical nonlinear refractive index measured by Z-scan technique was shown to be significantly altered in cells exposed to ACA with and without laser irradiation.

In the brain, the P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) subtype mediates trophic functions like differentiation and proliferation, and modulates fast synaptic transmission, both suggested to be affected in diseases of the central nervous system. Research on P2Y1R is limited because suitable brain-penetrating P2Y1R-selective tracers are not yet available. Here, we describe the first efforts to develop an 18F-labeled PET tracer based on the structure of the highly affine and selective, non-nucleotidic P2Y1R allosteric modulator 1-(2-[2-(tert-butyl)phenoxy]pyridin-3-yl)-3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]urea (7). A small series of fluorinated compounds was developed by systematic modification of the p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl, the urea and the 2-pyridyl subunits of the lead compound 7. Additionally, the p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl subunit was substituted by carborane, a boron-rich cluster with potential applicability in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). By functional assays, the new fluorinated derivative 1-{2-[2-(tert-butyl)phenoxy]pyridin-3-yl}-3-[4-(2-fluoroethyl)phenyl]urea (18) was identified with a high P2Y1R antagonistic potency (IC50 = 10 nM).

These aurones displayed a selective inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria with excellent Therapeutic Index values, while showing no significant action on several Gram-negative strains, H. pylori and V. alginolyticus being the only susceptible strains among the Gram-negative bacteria tested. A permeabilization assay showed that the antibacterial activity of at least some of the aurones could be linked to alterations of the bacterial membrane.

The concentrations of PCDD/Fs observed in zone A are higher than those in zone B, suggesting that PCDD/Fs could be transported from zone A to zone B through surface soil erosion and runoff events. The main contributor to the total TEQ concentration was 2,3,7,8-TCDD, which was the indicator of Agent Orange contamination, accounting for 91 ± 9% and 72 ± 17% of the total TEQ concentrations measured in zones A and B, respectively. Comparison of PCDD/F concentrations in different soil layers reveals that the topsoil layer (at depth < 1 m) contributed 81-95% to the total PCDD/Fs in the study area, indicating that future remediation projects should focus on this topsoil layer. Since PCDD/F contamination in A-So airbase has not significantly improved for the last 20 years, remediation projects are urgently needed in order to mitigate the negative impacts of PCDD/F contamination on human health and wellbeing.",Mechanisms and pathways of debromination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in various nano-zerovalent iron-based bimetallic systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665128,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 19,"This study investigated the relative significance of electron transfer (e-transfer) and H-atom transfer (H-transfer) in a nanoscale zerovalent iron (n-ZVI) system and six n-ZVI-based bimetallic systems (Fe/Cu, Fe/Ni, Fe/Pd, Fe/Ag, Fe/Pt, and Fe/Au) through a case study of the debromination of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47). The results revealed that the reactivities of these bimetallic particles to BDE-47 decreased in the following order: Fe/Pd>Fe/Ag>Fe/Cu>Fe/Ni>Fe/Au>Fe/Pt≈n-ZVI. Debromination of BDE-47 in metal-H2 systems suggested that Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu and Au can utilize H2 to debrominate BDE-47. In the H-transfer process, BDE-47 preferentially debrominated the para‑bromine substituent to generate BDE-17, whereas in the e-transfer process, BDE-47 preferentially debrominate ortho‑bromine substituent to generate BDE-28. The debromination pathways of BDE-47 in bimetallic and NaBH4-metal systems suggested that Fe/Ni, Fe/Pd and Fe/Pt debrominate polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) through a H-transfer dominant mechanism, while Fe/Ag debrominate PBDEs through an e-transfer dominant mechanism. In the cases of Fe/Cu and Fe/Au, the e-transfer and H-transfer may be equally involved in the debromination of PBDEs. These results greatly improve our understanding of the relative significance of e-transfer and H-transfer in the dehalogenation of halogenated aromatic compounds (HACs) in various n-ZVI-based bimetallic systems.",Eco-efficiency analysis of recycling recovered solid wood from construction into laminated timber products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665127,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 19,"To establish a bioeconomy, the demand for renewable resources like wood is likely to increase. To satisfy the demand, cascading, i.e. the sequential use of one unit of a resource in multiple applications with energy recovery as the final step, is a key concept to improve the efficiency of wood utilization. Today, the systematic wood cascading is still in its infancies and limited to the downcycling of wood, i.e. the degradation of material quality. New recycling technologies are needed, which maintain the material quality at the beginning of the cascade chain and mobilize yet unused resources. Therefore, a new recycling technology for recovered solid wood from construction into glued laminated timber products was developed.1 To identify the environmental and economic performance of the process, the eco-efficiency was assessed by the joint application of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). As reference system, the incineration of the recovered wood was analyzed, representing the common treatment for recovered wood from construction in Germany. System expansion was applied to solve multifunctionality. The results indicate that the recycling of recovered wood into glued laminated timber products is environmentally and economically viable and offers possibility for the production of value added products. The recycling further shows up to 29% of lower environmental impacts and 32% of lower costs compared to the incineration, if system expansion is based on wood energy. The operational processes required for the solid wood cascading are of minor relevance for the economic and environmental performance. Instead, primary technologies like glue lamination and the incineration are key drivers. In all considered scenarios, the material recycling has a 15-150% higher eco-efficiency compared to the incineration. In conclusion, the further development for the practical implementation of the recycling process is recommended to enhance the implementation of the cascading concept.",Short-term prediction of extremely hot days in summer due to climate change and ENSO and related attributable mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665126,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 19,"Summer days with extremely hot temperatures in Taiwan have been increasing for the past few decades, and this continuing trend is expected to worsen heat-related mortality. To mitigate the corresponding health impacts, in this study, we developed a statistical state-space model to predict the number of extremely hot days in June-September for the next year. Based on historical data from 1951 to 2017, we estimated the climate change trend after adjusting for the nonlinear lagged effect of the Niño 3.4 index. We then developed a predictive state-space model using these two primary factors and adjusting for residual autocorrelations. Validation results comparing the extremely hot days observed over 2015-2017 with predictions showed that 86% of the average prediction errors were within 4 days of the observations. To assess the health impacts, we applied the model to the projection of heat-attributable mortality (AM) in 2018 by adopting a comparative risk assessment (CRA) approach with the reference period of 2001-2010. The results showed that the Taipei metropolitan area in northern Taiwan is the most affected region with AM of 1501 deaths from all-causes, followed by Taichung in central Taiwan with 490 deaths. The prediction model and the CRA projection provide both a tool and guidance for public health administrators to address the imminent threat posed by climate change.","Effect of sleep quality on memory, executive function, and language performance in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and controlled epilepsy versus healthy controls - A prospective study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665125,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 03 25,"We aimed to evaluate the effect of sleep quality on memory, executive function, and language performance in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and controlled epilepsy and compare these with healthy individuals. We prospectively enrolled 37 adolescent and adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy (Group 1) and controlled epilepsy (Group 2) in each group. History pertaining to epilepsy and sleep were recorded, and all patients underwent overnight polysomnography. Language, memory, and executive function assessments were done using Western Aphasia Battery, Post Graduate Institute (PGI) memory scale, and battery of four executive function tests (Trail Making Test A & B, Digit symbol test, Stroop Task, and Verbal Fluency Test), respectively. Forty age- and sex-matched controls were also included in the study. Significant differences were noted in both objective and subjective sleep parameters among all the groups. On polysomnography, parameters like total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and rapid eye movement (REM) latency were found to be significantly worse in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. Cognitive and executive parameters were significantly impaired in Group 1. Shorter total sleep time, poorer sleep efficiency, and prolonged sleep latencies were observed to be associated with poor memory and executive function in patients with refractory epilepsy. Our study strongly suggests that sleep disturbances, mainly shorter total sleep time, poor sleep efficiency, and prolonged sleep latencies, are associated with impaired memory and executive function in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and to a lesser extent, among those with medically controlled epilepsy.",Assessing research impact: Australian Research Council criteria and the case of Family Wellbeing research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665124,Evaluation and program planning,2019 03 11,"Researchers worldwide are increasingly reporting the societal impact of their research as part of national research productivity assessments. However, the challenges they encounter in developing their impact case studies against specified government assessment criteria and how pitfalls can be mitigated are not reported. This paper examines the key steps taken to develop an Aboriginal Family Wellbeing (FWB) empowerment research impact case study in the context of an Australian Research Council (ARC) pilot research impact assessment exercise and the challenges involved in applying the ARC criteria. The requirement that researchers demonstrate how their institutions support them to conduct impactful research has the potential to create supportive environments for researchers to be more responsive to the needs of users outside academia. However, the 15-year reference period for the associated research underpinning the reported impact and the focus on researcher's current institutional affiliation constitute potential constraints to demonstrating the true impact of research. For researchers working with Indigenous people, relationships that build over long periods of time, irrespective of university affiliation, are critical to conducting impactful research. A more open-ended time-frame, with no institutional restrictions for the 'associated research' provides the best opportunity to demonstrate the true benefits of research not only for Indigenous people but for Australian society more broadly.",Predictive value of attentional bias for the recurrence of depression: A 4-year prospective study in remitted depressed individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665123,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 03 09,"Previous research showed that individuals who were remitted from a depressive disorder displayed heightened attention towards negative adjectives (e.g., worthless). We tested if this attentional bias (AB) is predictive of future recurrence of depressive episodes and/or having depressive symptoms at 2- and 4-year follow-up. We used a longitudinal approach within the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) and selected participants who were remitted from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 918). AB was measured with a verbal Exogenous Cueing Task; using 2 presentation times (500 and 1250 ms) and 3 stimulus types (negative, positive, neutral). Over 4 years, we prospectively assessed recurrence of depressive episodes and depressive symptomatology after participants completed the ECT. Diagnosis of depressive disorder was measured with clinical rating-scales and self-report questionnaires. A heightened probability of recurrence was neither associated with (heightened) AB for negative nor with (lowered) AB for positive adjectives. Thus, the findings do not support the view that an AB toward negative stimuli or away from positive stimuli plays a critical role in the recurrence of depression.",Occurrence of legacy and alternative plasticizers in indoor dust from various EU countries and implications for human exposure via dust ingestion and dermal absorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665122,Environmental research,2019 02 20,"Plasticizers are a category of chemicals extensively used in consumer products and, consequently, their presence is ubiquitous in the indoor environment. In the present study, an analytical method has been developed for the quantification of plasticizers (7 legacy phthalate esters (LPEs) and 14 alternative plasticizers (APs)) in indoor floor dust based on ultrasonic and vortex extraction, Florisil fractionation and GC-(EI)-MS analysis. Dust samples (n = 54) were collected from homes, offices, and daycare centers from different EU countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and Sweden). Method LOQs ranged from 0.2 to 5 μg/g. Tri-n-hexyl trimellitate (THTM) was not detected in any sample, whereas dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diphenyl phthalate and acetyl triethyl citrate (ATEC) were detected only in 6, 2 and 1 out of 54 samples, respectively. The highest concentrations of plasticizers were measured in Swedish offices, at a mean concentration of total plasticizers of 1800 μg/g, followed by Swedish daycare centers at 1200 and 670 μg/g for winter and spring sampling, respectively. Generally, the contribution of APs was slightly higher than for LPEs for all indoor environments (mean contribution 60% and 40%, respectively based on contributions per indoor environment). For the APs, main contributors were DINP in Belgian homes (28%), Swedish offices (60%), Swedish daycare centers (48%), and Dutch offices (31%) and DEHT in Belgian (28%), Irish (40%) and Dutch homes (37%) of total APs. The predominant LPE was bis-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP) with a mean contribution varying from 60% to 85% of total LPEs. Human exposure was evaluated for dust ingestion and dermal absorption using hazard quotients (HQs) of plasticizers (ratio between average daily doses and the reference dose). None of the HQs of plasticizers exceeded 1, meaning that the risk for adverse human health effects from these plasticizers via dust ingestion and dermal absorption is unlikely.","Groundwater level changes with a focus on agricultural areas in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, 2002-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665121,Environmental research,2019 02 20,"Climate change impacts all water sources, including high quality groundwater that supplies agricultural irrigation in many regions of the United States. This study assessed groundwater level changes in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region with a focus on cultivated areas. Trends of groundwater level were estimated using linear regression, and examined for shallow, medium, and deep depths across physiographic regions of Mid-Atlantic. A hotspot analysis was conducted to identify spatial clusters of wells with rising or declining groundwater levels. In addition, differences in the percentage of cultivated area with declining groundwater between cultivated land categories was examined at the county level. From 2002-2016, the Mid-Atlantic region had an overall decline in groundwater level (0.06 m/yr, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.09) although groundwater changes varied by physiographic regions. The Coastal Plain physiographic region was dominated by declining groundwater wells (48%) and had the most significant groundwater level declines (0.23 m/yr, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.26). Significant groundwater level rises were detected in Southern Virginia adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay (0.92 m/yr on average), which could be due to the cessation of groundwater withdrawal from one of the region's largest groundwater users. In the Mid-Atlantic region, shallow groundwater was found to have slight rising trends (0.08 m, p < 0.05) while deeper groundwater showed distinctive declining trends (1.36 m, p < 0.05) between 2002 and 2016. There were significantly more cultivated areas with declining groundwater levels (88% vs. 35%, p < 0.05) in counties with high percentages of cropland (> 50%) compared to areas covered by less cropland. As climate and human pressures increase, it will be critical to identify and evaluate alternative water sources, such as reclaimed water, to sustain agricultural production and protect groundwater resources."

Lipopeptides produced by B. subtilis Hyhel1 have been previously related as responsible by bioleaching and intracellular copper crystal production. However, there were no records relating CuLps to extracellular copper crystal production. To study this process, CuLps were isolated from bioleaching liquor and kept at 8 °C to facilitate the CuLps aggregation. After three months, blue spheres (BS) were observed in the CuLp fraction. These spheres were then analyzed by SEM-EDS, MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, GC-MS and FTIR. SEM-EDS analysis showed that they were formed by polycrystalline structures mainly composed by Cu (46.5% m/m) and positioned concentrically. MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and GCMS showed that peptide bonds of CuLp were broken, producing lipid chains and amino acids free. The FTIR of BS showed three nitro groups: CN, NN and NO, which were not found in the control. These data suggest that the CuLp amino acid produced a CN group linked to copper, as CuCN blocks, that auto-assembled in supramolecular structures. This phenomenon could be explored as a method to recover copper and to obtain supramolecular CuCN structures, which in turn may be used as template for superconductor or computing devices.",Effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis on U(VI) sequestration by Al-goethite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665108,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 05,"Effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) on U(VI) sequestration by Al-goethite were conducted under different geologic conditions. The batch experiments showed that S. epidermidis signiﬁcantly enhanced the adsorption rates of U(VI) at pH < 9.0 due to the additional metal binding sites. The maximum adsorption capacities of U(VI) on Al-goethite and Al-goethite +S. epidermidis at pH 4.0 and 310 K were calculated from Langmuir equation to be 13.16 and 47.86 mg/g, respectively. The decreased adsorption of U(VI) on Al-goethite+ S. epidermidis at high carbonate and pH conditions were primarily driven by the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged U(VI)-carbonate complexes and the negatively charged adsorbents. According to XPS analysis, the adsorbed U(VI) can be reduced to U(IV) by S. epidermidis, whereas inhibited reduction of U(VI) on Al-goethite + S. epidermidis at high pH could be attributed to the complexation of structural Fe(III) with the oxygen-containing functional groups of S. epidermidis. FT-IR analysis further demonstrated that the bonding of structural Fe(III) with functional groups (e.g., carboxyl and phosphate groups) of S. epidermidis. These results herein are important to understand the fate and transport of U(VI) on the mineral-bacteria ternary systems in the near-surface environment.","Post-functionalization of UiO-66-NH2 by 2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole for the high efficient removal of Hg(II) in water.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665107,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 05,"A new MOFs adsorbent was prepared by post-functionalization of UiO-66-NH2 with 2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole and utilized to remove the Hg(II) in water selectively. The UiO-66-types were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and zeta potential instruments. The adsorption properties of the new MOFs adsorbent were investigated by batch experiments. The actual maximum adsorption amount was 670.5 mg/g at the optimal pH of 3. Adsorption kinetic and isotherm models were exceedingly fitted to pseudo-second-order and Langmuir/Dubinin-Radushkevich, respectively. The adsorption process and mode were geared to monolayer and chemisorption, the removal rate was directly proportional to the square of mercury ions concentration. The UiO-66-DMTD adsorbent was easy to be regenerated and the removal rate decreased by only 13.5% after ten consecutive cycles. The results of FTIR, XRD and XPS suggested that the adsorption mechanism lay on the complexation reaction between Hg(II) and thiol/nitrogen-containing groups. Moreover, compared with other competitive metal ions, viz., Zn(II), Co(IV), Ni(II), Cd(II), Mg(II), Fe(III), Ca(II) and Cu(II), the UiO-66-DMTD demonstrated an outstanding selective adsorption for Hg(II). These results manifested that the UiO-66-DMTD was a latent adsorbent for the efficient and selective removal of Hg(II) in wastewater.",Lignin xanthate resin-bentonite clay composite as a highly effective and low-cost adsorbent for the removal of doxycycline hydrochloride antibiotic and mercury ions in water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665106,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 05,"Natural-occurring polymer intercalated inorganic clay composites have received increasing interests in water cleanup for the features of eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and availability. Herein, a new lignin xanthate resin (LXR) intercalated bentonite clay composite (LXR-BT) for the adsorption of representative organic doxycycline hydrochloride (DCH) antibiotic and inorganic Hg(II) in water was created through a feasible process. Structural characterizations by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Thermo gravimetric analysis (TG), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed LXR was successfully intercalated between the layers of bentonite clay. The adsorption performance of DCH/Hg(II) by LXR-BT was studied in detail with varied dosage, solution pH, contact time, and initial DCH/Hg(II) concentration. The results indicated that the adsorption capacities of DCH/Hg(II) on LXR-BT were much higher than that on bentonite, and the adsorption kinetics and isotherms followed the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the adsorption mechanisms of DCH (or Hg(II)) was mainly due to π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction of DCH (or the complexation of Hg(II)) with the functional groups in the LXR-BT. This study suggested the possibility of LXR-BT as a new cost-effective adsorbent for both organic and inorganic pollutants removal in water.",Evaluation of electrokinetics coupled with a reactive barrier of activated carbon loaded with a nanoscale zero-valent iron for selenite removal from contaminated soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665105,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 05,"The range between dietary deficient and toxic levels for selenium is quite narrow. In this study, the synergistic effects of electrokinetics (EK) and a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) on the reductive sequestration of Se(IV) oxyanions from spiked soils were investigated in detail. Activated charcoal (AC)-supported Fe(II) and nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) were prepared as the PRB media for use in an electrolyzer. In aqueous equilibrium adsorption tests, the AC-supported nZVI medium had a higher adsorption capacity than that of the other adsorbents. The Se(IV) removal isotherms were well-fitted using the Langmuir model. The Se(IV) removal rates were accurately predicted by both pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. For the coupled systems, a moderate increase in the number of PRBs and decrease in the PRB thickness in the electrolyzer enhanced the removal and catalytic recovery of Se(IV) from the spiked soil samples. A Se(VI) removal efficiency of approximately 95% and Se(VI) reduction efficiency of 90% were achieved in the optimized electrochemical system. The Se(IV) species were reduced to Se° and FeSe by the AC-supported nZVI regardless of the pH distribution. The experimental results provide guidance for the multichannel recovery of Se from abandoned ore tailings or solid wastes.",Effects of cadmium on fecundity and defence ability of Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665104,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 07,"Cadmium (chemical symbol, Cd) is an extremely common pollutant that poses a toxicity threat to organisms. Therefore, we tested Drosophila melanogaster fecundity, Cd accumulation, and activity of two enzymes following Cd stress and used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify the mRNA expression levels of several genes involved in fecundity and defence. D. melanogaster was placed in a medium containing different concentrations of Cd (13, 26, and 52 mg L-1), following which, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy showed that Cd accumulation in Drosophila increased with the increase in its dietary intake. We also observed that Cd at these concentrations significantly prolonged the mating latency in females and reduced the number of eggs laid. However, the same Cd concentrations did not affect male fecundity. Acetylcholinesterase activity was only detected at 52 mg L-1 Cd in both sexes, whereas glutathione S-transferase activity was inhibited at 26 and 52 mg L-1 Cd in females. The results of qPCR indicated that exposure to 13-52 mg L-1 Cd affected the expression of reproduction-related genes, including downregulation of enok and upregulation of dally and dpp. The same level of exposure also induced transcriptional responses from three defence-related genes (hsp70, gstd2, and gstd6). Taken together, the results revealed that Cd exposure might negatively affect the expression of genes associated with D. melanogaster reproduction and trigger the transcription of defence-related genes. We suggest that further analyses of fecundity and defence responses may help develop indicators of Cd toxicity and improve our understanding of antitoxin defences.","Chemical profiling, cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity of foliar volatiles of Hyptis suaveolens.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665103,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 07,"In the present study, the essential oil (EO) of Hyptis suaveolens has been explored for the first time for its phytotoxic and cytotoxic activities. The phytotoxic activity was assessed against rice (Oryza sativa) and its major troublesome weed, Echinochloa crus-galli, under laboratory and screenhouse conditions. GC-MS analysis revealed EO to be monoterpenoid (~ 79% monoterpenes) in nature with α-phellandrene (22.8%), α-pinene (10.1%) and limonene (8.5%) as the major chemical constituents. The laboratory bioassay showed a complete growth inhibitory effect of EO (≥ 2 mg mL-1) towards the germination and seedling growth of E. crus-galli. However, the inhibitory effect on rice was much less (~40% inhibition). EO caused visible injury, reduction in chlorophyll content, cell viability and ultimately led to complete wilting of E. crus-galli plants. In addition, EO altered the cell division in the meristematic cells of Allium cepa as depicted by ~63% decrease in mitotic index. EO exposure induced several aberrations at chromosomal (c-mitosis, anaphase bridges, chromosomal breakage, vagrant chromosomes, and sticky chromosomes) and cytological level (cytoplasm destruction, peripheral nuclei, and bi-nucleate cells). The present study concludes that H. suaveolens EO possesses phytotoxic activity due to its mito-depressive activity, and could serve as a natural herbicide under sustainable agricultural practices.",Using neuroimaging to predict relapse in stimulant dependence: A comparison of linear and machine learning models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665102,NeuroImage.

Clinical,2019 05 28,"Brain volume loss, or atrophy, has been proven to be an important characteristic of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. To use atrophy rate as a reliable clinical biomarker and to increase statistical power in clinical treatment trials, measurement variability needs to be minimized. Among other sources, systematic differences between different MR scanners are suspected to contribute to this variability. In this study we developed and performed initial validation tests of an MR-compatible phantom and analysis software for robust and reliable evaluation of the brain volume loss. The phantom contained three inflatable models of brain structures, i.e. cerebral hemisphere, putamen, and caudate nucleus. Software to reliably quantify volumes form the phantom images was also developed. To validate the method, the phantom was imaged using 3D T1-weighted protocols at three clinical 3T MR scanners from different vendors. Calculated volume change from MRI was compared with the known applied volume change using ICC and mean absolute difference. As assessed by the ICC, the agreement between our developed software and the applied volume change for different structures ranged from 0.999-1 for hemisphere, 0.976-0.998 for putamen, and 0.985-0.999 for caudate nucleus. The mean absolute differences between measured and applied volume change were 109-332 μL for hemisphere, 2.9-11.9 μL for putamen, and 2.2-10.1 μL for caudate nucleus. This method offers a reliable and robust measurement of volume change using MR images and could potentially be used to standardize clinical measurement of atrophy rates.",Assessment and optimization of rolling circle amplification protocols for the detection and characterization of badnaviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665100,Virology,2019 02 20,"The genus Badnavirus is characterized by members that are genetically and serologically heterogeneous which presents challenges for their detection and characterization.

This work has developed a series of amino-functionalized porous carbon materials (NH2-BPCs), via a facile chemical modification method, which have been found efficient for the removal of sulfonamide antibiotics from simulated wastewater. Studies on adsorption kinetics and isotherms of antibiotics in simulated aqueous phases indicated that the adsorption capacity of sulfadiazine (SDZ) by NH2-BPCs showed a large value under acidic conditions (pH < 5). Moreover, the adsorption rate constant of NH2-BPCs was greatly enhanced upon amino modification, which demonstrated faster and more effective adsorption efficiency for antibiotics removal. These results suggested that surface amino modification of porous carbons might be a viable pathway to increase the adsorption affinity and efficiency of antibiotics with great potentials for water remediation.",The experiences of people who inject drugs of skin and soft tissue infections and harm reduction: A qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665085,The International journal on drug policy,2019 03 17,"Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) among people who inject drugs (PWID) are considered a public health concern.

ECoG recordings can be evoked using acoustic stimulation and recorded from an extra- or intra-cochlear electrode in CI users. Recordings reflect contributions from cochlear hair cells and the auditory nerve. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of using Custom Sound EP (clinically available software) to record ECoG responses in Nucleus Hybrid CI users with preserved acoustic hearing in the implanted ear (Abbas et al, 2017). While successful, the recording procedures were time intensive, limiting clinical applications. The current report describes how we improved data collection efficiency by writing custom software using Python programming language. The software interfaced with Nucleus Implant Communicator (NIC) routines to record responses from an intracochlear electrode. ECoG responses were recorded in eight CI users with preserved acoustic hearing using Custom Sound EP and the Python-based software. Responses were similar across both recording systems, but the recording time decreased significantly using the Python-based software. Seven additional CI users underwent repeated testing using the Python-based software and showed high test-retest reliability.

However, non-medical needs may also be relevant in health care decision-making. This paper considers how members of the general public value access to a health service given equal medical needs, where some service users have additional non-medical needs. There are three primary research questions. First, are public preferences regarding access to a health care service symmetric and inequality averse? Second, are public preferences asymmetric across different needs groups? And third, which individual characteristics of respondents are predictive of different public preferences in this domain? An online survey of the UK general public was conducted in January 2017 using binary choice questions. The hypothetical scenarios involved allocating extra resources from a social perspective, to reduce the waiting time to access a mental health service for the unemployed, for the employed, or for both groups. Based on a valid sample of 662 respondents, the study found that the three main preference categories were: inequality averse and symmetric, inequality averse and asymmetric in favour of the unemployed, and inequality seeking and asymmetric in favour of the unemployed, with the first group being the largest. Respondents' current labour market status was found to explain their preferences so that those who were currently job-seeking were more likely to demonstrate preferences that favoured the unemployed, and those who were currently unemployed were less likely to demonstrate asymmetric preferences that favoured the employed. The implications from these findings are that health policies in the UK that support equal access for equal medical need are likely to be received most favourably, yet a non-trivial minority may support policies favouring those with other, non-medical needs.",Women's stories of living with breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665063,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 02 15,"Globally, breast cancer is by far the most frequently occurring cancer amongst women.

In the course of their education, nurses learn how to become important conduits for information on diabetes management during their eventual interactions with patients. Exploring the status and trends of diabetes-related knowledge in nursing students is one method to explore the idea that one's community affects how one sees disease. However, they are not yet experts, which places them in a period of transition. This study used data mined from the Shadow Health Digital Clinical Experience™ virtual patient exams conducted by nursing students between the years of 2012 and 2015 to find any potential demographic or spatial trends within simulation performance results from nursing students who examined a virtual patient with self-managed diabetes. Findings of the analysis indicated that age and experience affected the way in which an examination was conducted, where older and more experienced nursing students asked 8% fewer examination questions, yet showed 32% more empathy and offered 76% more educational statements than their younger counterparts. Spatial trends were less pronounced, although deeper analysis revealed that students in states closer to the national mean for population rate with diabetes perform better, show more empathy, and offer more educational statements during examinations compared to states well above or well below the national mean. This suggests that targeted information may be preferable to ""one-size-fits-all"" public health awareness and education programs for diabetes programs used uniformly across the country.","Production, purification, and evaluation of quail immunoglobulin Y against Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665061,Molecular immunology,2019 05 06,"Salmonella species have been the major foodborne problems in food production systems, with Salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and enteritidis (S. enteritidis) being among the more common isolates. The oral administration of chicken egg yolk specific antibodies (IgYs) has been established as an efficient alternative for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal pathogens including Salmonella. The present study was aimed to investigate the possible production of specific IgYs against Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis in quail egg yolks. Salmonella spp.-free female Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were intramuscularly immunized with formalin or heat-inactivated Salmonella immunogens (1.0 × 109 CFU/mL) emulsified with Freund adjuvants. Egg yolk IgYs were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation method. Anti-Salmonella IgYs titer and specificity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis. Salmonella specific IgYs detected in the immunized quails were significantly higher than those of the control group, which confirmed the immunization procedure. Specific IgYs against S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis were identified in both groups immunized with heat or formalin-inactivated immunogens. However, formalin-inactivated immunogens induced relatively higher immune responses over the heat-inactivated ones. Quail anti-Salmonella IgYs showed a high specificity to their corresponding immunogens, with moderate cross-reactivity to other members of Enterobacteriaceae family. Quail can be regarded as a valuable and inexpensive source for producing large-scale of specific antibodies that can be used for immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic purposes.",Multicenter study on midwifery students' attitudes towards abortion and it's place in their future practice - Comparison of respondents at early and late stages of the university education.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665059,Nurse education in practice,2019 04 29,"Evidence based midwifery education and practice are fundamental to assure high quality care of childbearing women, also with complications. In Poland, midwifery education includes aspects of participation in the abortion. A cross-sectional study was designed to describe the attitudes towards abortion at the beginning and at the end of students' university education. The study was aimed to verify change of attitudes throughout the course of the university education. Most of the students approved abortion if the pregnancy constitutes a threat to woman's health or life, results from a rape, or whenever the fetus presents with a lethal defect. More than a half did not approve participation in the abortion if the fetus presents with a non-lethal defect. Generally, the acceptance rates were significantly higher among the final year students, but more than a half of them stated, that the abortion-related topics were inadequately addressed in their study curriculum. That bring to the conclusion that higher rates of abortion acceptance among the final year students, were not necessarily a manifestation of informed approval for this procedure, but rather a form of a ""systemic"" adjustment. Midwifery program need to be revised to support students in developing informed and evidence-based attitudes toward abortion.","TaZFP1, a C2H2 type-ZFP gene of T. aestivum, mediates salt stress tolerance of plants by modulating diverse stress-defensive physiological processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665058,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 02 15,"Salt stress suppresses plant growth, development, and crop productivity. In this study, we characterized the role of TaZFP1, a C2H2 type-zinc finger protein family member of T. aestivum, in salt stress tolerance. TaZFP1 possesses a conserved C2H2 motif (CX2-4CX12HX3-5H) shared by plant ZFP proteins, translocates to the nucleus after endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assortment, and displays a ZF 3-D structure similar to its eukaryote homologs. The transcripts of TaZFP1 were upregulated during salt stress condition and this effect was restored under normal conditions. Compared to wild type (WT), the transgenic lines of TaZFP1 overexpression or knockdown displayed improved phenotypes, biomass, photosynthesis parameters (Pn, ΨPSII, and NPQ), osmolytes contents (i.e. proline and soluble sugar), and enhanced antioxidant enzyme (AE) activity following salt stress treatment. A set of genes associated with proline synthesis (i.e., NtP5CS1 and NtP5CS2) and encoding AEs (i.e., NtSOD2, NtCAT1, and NtPOD4) were upregulated in the salt-challenged transgenic lines of TaZFP1 expression. Additionally, the transgenic lines exhibited similar stomata movement patterns and leaf water retention properties under salinity conditions compared to those induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, suggesting that the TaZFP1-mediated salt response is dependent on the ABA signaling. High throughput RNAseq analysis revealed significant alteration of gene transcription in transgenic lines upon salt stress. Among them, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) represented by the gene ontology (GO) terms were associated with organic acid, carboxylic acid, carbohydrate, and coenzyme as well as organonitrogen compounds, translation, peptide metabolism, and peptide biosynthesis. A set of upregulated DEGs were found to be thylakoid- and photosystem-associated, which is consistent with the TaZFP1-mediated improvement in photosynthesis in salt-stressed transgenic lines. Our investigation indicated that the TaZFP1-mediated salt tolerance is ascribed to the regulation of gene functions related to photosynthesis, osmolytes metabolism and ROS homeostasis mediated by ABA signaling.","Sunshine, fertility and racial disparities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665057,Economics and human biology,2019 02 26,"This research investigates the effect of sun exposure on fertility, with a special focus on how its effects and consequences for birth outcomes may differ by race. Sun exposure is a key mechanism for obtaining Vitamin D, but this process is inhibited by skin pigmentation. Vitamin D has been linked to male and female fertility and risk of miscarriage, and Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among blacks than whites. Using 1989-2004 individual live births data from the Natality Detail Files, county-level, monthly conceptions are estimated as a function of monthly solar insolation, temperature and humidity, as well as month, time and location fixed effects and controls. Insolation has positive, statistically significant effects on fertility for both non-Hispanic blacks and whites, but the effects are stronger and the pattern of effect different for black mothers than white mothers. Poisson estimates from the main model suggest that a 1kWh increase in average daily insolation in the conception month - approximately the difference in sunshine experienced in the typical September vs. October - increases non-Hispanic black conceptions by 1% and non-Hispanic white conceptions by 0.6%. Allowing insolation's effect to differ by maternal characteristic suggests that the racial differences are not being driven by differences in socioeconomic status (SES). Models that allow for more complicated timing of insolation's effect further suggest that insolation pushes black (white) conceptions into the unfavorable (favorable) season of birth. These estimated effects and our decomposition analyses suggest that insolation - and the implied Vitamin D deficiency underlying its effect-helps explain why black conceptions are more likely to display a seasonal pattern that is disadvantageous to birth outcomes.",dbHDPLS: A database of human disease-related protein-ligand structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665056,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 04 03,"Protein-ligand complexes perform specific functions, most of which are related to human diseases.

However, time-related increase in driver drowsiness is well-known, and drowsy driving can affect response to take-over request (TOR). It was previously reported that a scheduled period of manual driving during automated driving was beneficial in maintaining driver arousal level. The present driving simulator study investigates the effects of scheduled manual driving on driver drowsiness and performance, as well as age differences therein. A total of 115 participants, whose gender was balanced and age was distributed uniformly from 20 to 70 years, drove an automated vehicle for 31 min, and a TOR was prompted before a collision event. A between-subjects design comprised two conditions: with versus without a scheduled 10-min interval of manual driving that ended 10 min before TOR. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and eyeblink durations estimated from electrooculograms (EOG) were used to subjectively and objectively measure participant's drowsiness. Reaction time, standard deviation of steering wheel angle, and minimum Time-to-Collison (TTC) were extracted to measure driver performance in response to TOR. The alleviating effect on drowsiness of 10-min scheduled manual driving became non-significant after another 10-min period of automated driving. Although the scheduled manual driving had no significant effect for younger drivers, older drivers reacted significantly more slowly in both steering and braking at the critical event. These findings provide essential insights for human-vehicle interactions: Scheduled manual driving cannot maintain drivers' arousal level for 10 min afterwards, and for older drivers, it would be better to avoid unnecessary task-switching between manual and automated driving.",Functional forms of the negative binomial models in safety performance functions for rural two-lane intersections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665054,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 04 03,"Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) play a prominent role in estimating intersection crashes, and identifying the sites with the highest potential for safety improvement. To maximize the crash prediction accuracy, this paper describes the application of different functional forms of the Negative Binomial (NB) models (i.e. NB-1, NB-2 and NB-P) in estimating safety performance functions by crash type for three types of rural two-lane intersections, including three-leg stop-controlled (3ST) intersections, four-leg stop-controlled (4ST) intersections and four-leg signalized (4SG) intersections. Crash types were aggregated into same-direction, opposite-direction, intersecting-direction and single-vehicle crashes. Major and minor road Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) were used as predictors in the SPF estimation. In addition, major and minor road AADT were also used as predictors in the estimation of the over-dispersion parameter of the NB models to account for the crash data heterogeneity. In the end, all NB models were compared based on both the model estimation goodness-of-fit and the prediction performance. The model goodness-of-fit indicates that the NB-P model outperforms the NB-1 and NB-2 models for most crash types and intersection types, by providing a flexible variance structure to the NB approaches. The parameterization of the over-dispersion factor verifies that the over-dispersion parameter of the NB models highly depends on how the variance structure is defined in the model, and the over-dispersion parameter is shown to vary among different intersections for each crash type and can be estimated using both the major and minor road AADT at rural two-lane intersections. The NB-P model is found to more effectively capture the variation of over-dispersion among intersections in NB models, which benefits the accommodation of data heterogeneity in intersection SPF development. The prediction performance comparison illustrates that the NB-P model slightly improves the crash prediction accuracy compared with the other two models, especially for the 3ST and 4SG intersections. In conclusion, the NB-P model with parameterized over-dispersion factor is recommended to provide more unbiased parameter estimates when estimating SPFs by crash type for rural two-lane intersections."

Here, we report the identification and characterization of atorvastatin as a new RXRα tetramer stabilizer by using structure-based virtual screening and demonstrate that virtual library screening can be used to aid in identifying RXRα ligands that can induce its tetramerization. In this study, docking was applied to screen the FDA-approved small molecule drugs in the DrugBank 4.0 collection. Two compounds were selected and purchased for testing.

Moreover, istain (1) reacted with pyrazolo-5-one or 3-substituted phenol in presence of malononitrile to afford spiroxindole derivatives (10a,b) and (11a,b). Also, compounds (10a,b) and (11a,b) were obtained through cyclization of (7a) with pyrazolo-5-one or 3-substituted phenol. The obtained compounds were identified by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis. Anticancer activity against three cancer cell lines (HepG-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7) were evaluated using sulforhodamine B assay method. Compounds 4b, 4c, 7a, 7c and 9 showed broad spectrum anticancer activity on the three tested cell lines with IC50 values less than 10 µM.

Loss of a protein's native structure may result in its biological malfunction and/or cellular toxicity that could cause associated diseases. Several factors were identified for causing structural changes of a protein, however quinone-induced protein modifications received very little attention whether for amyloidal or non-amyloidal proteins. In this paper, we report our investigation on lysozyme modifications upon treatment with selected benzoquinones (BQs), utilizing fluorescence spectroscopy including anisotropy determination, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and SDS-PAGE. Lysozyme was reacted with substituted BQs in order to examine substituent effects on protein modifications. In addition, we evaluated lysozyme modifications induced by 1,4-benzoquinone in concentration-, pH-, temperature-, and time-dependent studies. Our study shows that all BQs can readily modify lysozyme in a complex manner through adduct formation, oligomerization, polymeric aggregation, and/or fibrilization. Electrochemical properties of selected BQs were monitored using cyclic voltammetry in phosphate buffered aqueous solution, and it was found that quinone reduction potentials correlate well with their reactivity trend toward lysozyme.",Bioactive cytosporone derivatives isolated from the mangrove-derived fungus Dothiorella sp.

The aim of the present study was to investigate potential pathways leading from religion and spirituality to positive body image. Participants were 345 women who completed questionnaire measures of engagement with formal religion, spirituality, gratitude, self-objectification, and positive body image. Both engagement with formal religion and spirituality were found to be positively associated with positive body image. Further, mediation analyses showed that the relationship between spirituality and positive body image was mediated by gratitude and reduced self-objectification. It was concluded that a broader spiritual consciousness may assist women to develop a loving, appreciative, and respectful relationship with their bodies. In addition, gratitude and a de-emphasis on external appearance provide useful goals and potential intervention points for promoting positive body image.",The impact of no-makeup selfies on young women's body image.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665030,Body image,2019 04 08,"Viewing idealized images of attractive women on social media can negatively impact women's body image and mood. Although women tend to post idealized images on social media, some also post natural no-makeup images. This study examined the impact of viewing both made up and no-makeup selfies on young women's body image and mood. Female undergraduate students (N = 175) viewed either images of a woman wearing no makeup interspersed among idealized made up images of that woman (no-makeup condition), only idealized made up images of a woman (makeup only condition), or appearance-neutral travel images (control condition). Participants rated their state appearance satisfaction and mood pre- and post-exposure to the study images and rated their desire to change aspects of the face, hair, and skin post-exposure to the study images. Participants in the makeup only condition were less satisfied with their facial appearance and were more motivated to change aspects of their face, hair, and skin after exposure to the study images. Viewing the study images had no impact on the body image or mood of participants in the no-makeup condition. These results suggest that no-makeup selfies may reduce any negative impact of idealized made up images on women's facial concerns."

Alternatively, tissue engineering of new skin using patient-derived stem cells and scaffolding materials promises to greatly increase the functional and aesthetic outcome of skin wound healing. This work focused on the optimization of a polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) platelet-rich plasma (PRP) hydrogel for the protracted release of cytokines, growth factors, and signaling molecules and also the delivery of a provisional physical framework for stem cell angiogenesis. Freshly collected whole blood was utilized to synthesize PEGylated PRP hydrogels containing platelet concentrations ranging from 0 to 200,000 platelets/µl. Hydrogels were characterized using thromboelastography and impedance aggregometry for platelet function and were visualized using scanning electron microscopy. To assess the effects of PEGylated PRP hydrogels on cells, PRP solutions were seeded with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) prior to gelation. Following 14 days of incubation in vitro, increased platelet concentrations resulted in higher ASC proliferation and vascular gene and protein expression (assessed via RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunochemistry). Using a rat skin excision model, wounds treated with PRP + ASC hydrogels increased the number of vessels in the wound by day 8 (80.2 vs. 62.6 vessels/mm2) compared to controls. In conclusion, the proposed PEGylated PRP hydrogel promoted both in vitro and transient in vivo angiogenesis of ASCs for improved wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support an innovative means of cellular therapy intervention to improve surgical wound healing in a normal wound model. ASCs seeded within PEGylated PRP could be an efficacious and completely autologous therapy for treating patients who have poorly healing wounds caused by vascular insufficiency, previous irradiation, or full-thickness burns. Because wound healing is a dynamic and complex process, the application of more than one growth factor with ASCs demonstrates an advantageous way of improving healing.",Bioinspired baroplastic glycosaminoglycan sealants for soft tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665018,Acta biomaterialia,2019 03 01,"We describe biomimetic adhesives inspired by the marine glues fabricated by the sandcastle worm. The formation of stable polyelectrolyte complexes between poly-L-lysine (PLL) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with different sulfation degree - heparin (HEP), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) - is optimized by zeta-potential titrations. These PLL/GAG complexes are transformed into compact polyelectrolyte complexes (coPECs) with controlled water contents and densities via baroplastic processing. Rotational shear tests demonstrate that coPECs containing sulfated GAGs (HEP or CS) have solid-like properties, whereas HA-based complexes form highly hydrated viscous-like networks. The adhesiveness of the generated coPECs (normalized lap shear strength) is tested in dry and wet states using polystyrene and rabbit skin, respectively. In dry state, the adhesives exhibit lap shear strengths in the order of hundreds of kPa, with coPLL/HEP and coPLL/CS being about 1.5 times stronger than coPLL/HA. In wet state, all coPECs seal rabbit skin and recover over 60% of the elongation capacity of intact skin with coPLL/HA providing the sturdiest adhesion (∼85% elongation recovery). We demonstrate that this is due to the higher water fraction that improves the bonding between the wet specimens, showcasing the potential superior mechanical recovery on injured tissues. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of medical sealants with sufficient adhesive strength in the presence of water and moist remains a huge challenge. We present glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as biomaterials for the assembly of baroplastics with strong adhesive strength to soft tissues at physiological conditions. Baroplastics with tacky properties were generated by a mild assembly process based on polyelectrolyte complexation and compaction. These materials behave as versatile sealants: their adhesiveness can be adjusted to either dry or wet specimens because of the different sulfation degree of GAGs. These sealants were noncytotoxic towards L929 cells and allowed the damaged skin to recover a great deal of its native elasticity: they preserved the J-shaped stress/strain mechanical response that is typical of biological soft tissues.",Syndiotactic peptides for targeted delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665017,Acta biomaterialia,2019 03 01,"Lack of cell-type specificity and proteolytic susceptibility have long been the major bottlenecks for the development of peptide-based biomaterials for targeted drug delivery. Though a poly-l backbone provides the adaptability to re-conform the peptide structure to bind to a receptor, it also makes the peptide more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. We have attempted to address this issue by designing a set of syndiotactic peptides de novo, with alternating l- and d-amino acids in succession. The designed peptides have higher rates of cellular uptake than the Tat (48-60) peptide in breast and cervical cancer cells. The uptake is independent of concentration, temperature and endocytosis (clathrin mediated). Importantly, the peptides are stable in both human plasma and bovine serum. The peptide-drug conjugates are much less toxic to the non-cancerous cells than cancer cells. The designed peptides are a step forward towards the development of targeted drug delivery vectors on peptide templates. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Present options in chemotherapy have multiple side effects arising from the lack of cell-type specificity, which makes them synonymous with ""a Pyrrhic victory"". Proteolytic susceptibility and non-specificity towards cancer cells has stunted the development of peptide-based biomaterials for targeted drug delivery. We have designed a set of peptides, addressing the above-mentioned roadblocks at an in vitro level. The peptides were designed on the template of a naturally existing peptide antibiotic from Bacillus brevis. The designed peptides have higher rates of cellular transduction than the model peptide (Tat), and is majorly membrane based. The peptides are stable in serum and selective towards cancer cells.

Nanofibrillated celluloses administered at 6 or 18 μg to mice by intratracheal instillation were: 1) FINE NFC, 2-20 μm in length, 2-15 nm in width, 2) AS (-COOH), carboxylated, 0.5-10 μm in length, 4-10 nm in width, containing the biocide BIM MC4901 and 3) BIOCID FINE NFC: as (1) but containing BIM MC4901. FINE NFC administration increased neutrophil influx in BAL and induced SAA3 in plasma. AS (-COOH) produced lower neutrophil influx and systemic SAA3 levels than FINE NFC. Results obtained with BIOCID FINE NFC suggested that BIM MC4901 biocide did not explain the lowered response. Increased DNA damage levels were observed across materials, doses and time points. In conclusion, carboxylation of nanofibrillated cellulose was associated with reduced pulmonary and systemic toxicity, suggesting involvement of OH groups in the inflammatory and acute phase responses.",Exposure to working-hour characteristics and short sickness absence in hospital workers: A case-crossover study using objective data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665013,International journal of nursing studies,2019 04 01,"Shift work characteristics, such as the number of night shifts or quick returns, are linked to disturbed sleep and greater work-life conflict, but little is known about their association with short sickness absences.

However, how affective components of memories affect the brain-wide network recruited during the recollection of AMs remains largely unknown. Here, we examined effective connectivity during the elaboration of AMs - when retrieved episodic details are integrated to form a vivid construct - in the network composed by ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus and amygdala, three key regions associated with memory and affective processes. Functional MRI data was collected while volunteers recollected personal events of different types of valence and emotional intensity. Using dynamic causal modeling, we characterized the connections within the triadic network, and examined how they were modulated by the emotional intensity experienced during an event, and the valence of the affect evoked when recollecting the associated memory. Results primarily indicated the existence of a vmPFC to hippocampus effective connectivity during memory elaboration. Furthermore, the strength of the connectivity increased when participants relived memories of highly emotionally arousing events or that elicited stronger positive affect. These results indicate that the vmPFC drives hippocampal activity during memory elaboration, and plays a critical role in shaping affective responses that emanate from AMs.",Adaptive paradigms for mapping phonological regions in individual participants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665008,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Phonological encoding depends on left-lateralized regions in the supramarginal gyrus and the ventral precentral gyrus. Localization of these phonological regions in individual participants-including individuals with language impairments-is important in several research and clinical contexts. To localize these regions, we developed two paradigms that load on phonological encoding: a rhyme judgment task and a syllable counting task. Both paradigms relied on an adaptive staircase design to ensure that each individual performed each task at a similarly challenging level. The goal of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the two paradigms, in terms of their ability to consistently produce left-lateralized activations of the supramarginal gyrus and ventral precentral gyrus in neurologically normal individuals with presumptively normal language localization. Sixteen participants were scanned with fMRI as they performed the rhyme judgment paradigm, the syllable counting paradigm, and an adaptive semantic paradigm that we have described previously. We found that the rhyme and syllable paradigms both yielded left-lateralized supramarginal and ventral precentral activations in the majority of participants. The rhyme paradigm produced more lateralized and more reliable activations, and so should be favored in future applications. In contrast, the semantic paradigm did not reveal supramarginal or precentral activations in most participants, suggesting that the recruitment of these regions is indeed driven by phonological encoding, not language processing in general. In sum, the adaptive rhyme judgment paradigm was effective in localizing left-lateralized phonological encoding regions in individual participants, and, in conjunction with the adaptive semantic paradigm, can be used to map individual language networks.",A behavioral face preference deficit in a monkey with an incomplete face patch system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665007,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Primates are experts in face perception and naturally show a preference for faces under free-viewing conditions. The primate ventral stream is characterized by a network of face patches that selectively responds to faces, but it remains uncertain how important such parcellation is for face perception. Here we investigated free-viewing behavior in a female monkey who naturally lacks fMRI-defined posterior and middle lateral face patches. We presented a series of content-rich images of scenes that included faces or other objects to that monkey during a free-viewing task and tested a group of 10 control monkeys on the same task for comparison. We found that, compared to controls, the monkey with missing face patches showed a marked reduction of face viewing preference that was most pronounced for the first few fixations. In addition, her gaze fixation patterns were substantially distinct from those of controls, especially for pictures with a face. These data demonstrate an association between the clustering of neurons in face selective patches and a behavioral bias for faces in natural images."

The ILs were prepared from malic acid and choline, which are commonly used as food additives and generally regarded as safe. The choline malate IL (CM-IL) was formed via ionic interactions, which has been validated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Analysis by differential scanning calorimetry confirmed a melting point of -65.2 °C for CM-IL. In skin penetration study, CM-IL was proved to be able to deliver a model hydrophilic macromolecule dextran into deep skin. The amount of dextran delivered to epidermis and dermis by CM-IL is approximately two folds that of by dextran solution. Enhanced in vivo skin penetration by CM-IL was proved as well. The fluorescence of FITC-dextran could be observed permeating pervasively throughout the skin from 4 h to 24 h, while in the control groups it was mainly concentrated in stratum cornea (SC) and hair follicles. In addition, CM-IL did not shown any irritation to mice skin within 7 days of successive treatment and any toxicity to human epidermal cells (HEK-A) within 24 h. In conclusion, CM-IL could be potentially used as enhancers or vehicles for dermal delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules.","Effects of flow pattern, device and formulation on particle size distribution of nebulized aerosol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664994,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 13,"The evaluation of particle size recommended in the pharmacopeias requires a constant flow rate, and the method for pediatric inhaled drugs is the same as for adult drugs. In this study, the aerosol concentration and particle size distribution (PSD) were measured under a realistic breathing pattern and constant flow. Two types of nebulizer (i.e., breath-enhanced nebulizer and vibrating-mesh nebulizer) and two formulations (i.e., budesonide suspension and albuterol solution) were chosen for comparison. The aerosol concentration under the realistic pattern was not constant, which was different from the result at constant flow. The changing trend of aerosol concentration varied with the operation process of each device. The aerosol concentration profile was similar between budesonide suspension and albuterol solution. As to the PSD, as inspiratory flow increased, the X50 (50% undersize) increased with all nebulizers but Omron microAir NE-U22 nebulizer. There was good agreement between X50 obtained under the realistic inhalation patterns and their equivalent average flow rates by Bland-Altman analysis, although the X50 obtained under the realistic inhalation pattern was greater than value at constant flow. The agreement of the two breath-enhanced jet nebulizers was better than that of the vibrating-mesh nebulizers. The X50 of budesonide was not equal to that of albuterol when using the same nebulizer. Interestingly, a significant difference was observed in the X50 and Span when comparing the results of PSD under adult and child breathing patterns. Furthermore, all vibrating-mesh nebulizers produced aerosol droplets having larger mean diameter and narrower size distribution than those of the air-jet nebulizers. We conclude that it will be more conducive to the evaluation of particle size to use a laser diffractometer under a realistic pattern and make up for the shortcomings of cascade impactors. The effects of flow pattern, nebulizer and formulation should be taken into account in the evaluation of the qualities of nebulizer products in pharmaceutical practice.",A review on 5-aminosalicylic acid colon-targeted oral drug delivery systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664993,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 13,"Site-specific colon drug delivery is a practical approach for the treatment of local diseases of the colon with several advantages such as rapid onset of action and reduction of the dosage of the drug as well as minimization of harmful side effects. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a drug of choice in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colitis. For the efficient delivery of this drug, it is vital to prevent 5-ASA release in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and to promote its release in the proximal colon. Different approaches including chemical manipulation of drug molecule for production of prodrugs or modification of drug delivery systems using pH-dependent, time-dependent and/or bacterially biodegradable materials have been tried to optimize 5-ASA delivery to the colon.

This dysphoric state has been associated with alexithymia, which compromises an individual's abilities to acknowledge, recognize, and regulate emotional states. A physiological correlate of emotional regulation is autonomic flexibility, as shown by emotional dysregulation in men who misuse alcohol being correlated with reduced parasympathetic activation to control heart rate variability during stress and/or conflict situations. Hence, the main aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term abstinent alcoholic (LTAA) men exhibit higher levels of negative affect and sympathetic activation (cardiovascular and electrodermal) in response to acute standardized laboratory stress than non-alcoholic controls. In addition, we hypothesized that the higher the alexithymic traits, the greater would be the increase in negative affect and sympathetic activation in response to stress, especially in LTAAs. Our data demonstrated that LTAAs experienced slightly greater increases in anxiety, states of anger, and worsening of mood than controls. Moreover, they exhibited lower high-frequency heart rate variability, respiratory sinus arrhythmia values, shorter pre-ejection periods, and higher respiratory rates than controls. Finally, alexithymic traits imply greater worsening of mood and sympathetic predominance (shorter pre-ejection periods and smaller magnitude of response), with the associations being stronger in LTAAs. These findings indicate a different emotional and cardiovascular response to psychosocial stress in LTAA than non-alcoholic men. Improving our knowledge of the way this population reacts to stress may help identify risk factors for alcohol relapse."

This study examined if children's attention to socio-affective stimuli was associated with their autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity during parent-child interactions. Children's sustained attention to facial expressions of emotion (afraid, happy, sad) was indexed using the late positive potential (LPP) event-related potential (ERP) component during a computer-based task. To measure ANS reactivity, children's respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was assessed at baseline and during positive and negative parent-child discussions. Enhanced LPP amplitudes in response to all emotional facial expressions, reflecting greater sustained attention to socio-affective stimuli, were associated with increased RSA reactivity during parent-child discussions. These results show correspondence between two psychophysiological substrates of emotion processing in healthy children and highlight how these systems may be synergistic forces contributing to emotion reactivity.",Association of purinergic receptor P2RX7 gene polymorphisms with depression symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664971,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 05 07,"The activation of the ATP-gated P2RX7 (purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 7) produces microglial activation, a process which has been demonstrated in depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Emerging data over the last years highlighted the importance of P2X7 cation channel as a potential drug target for these central nervous system disorders. The Gln460Arg (rs2230912) polymorphism of the P2RX7 gene has been widely studied in mood disorders, however the results are still controversial. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the C-terminal region of this gene in major depressive and bipolar disorders (MDD and BD) by studying possibly functional, non-synonymous polymorphisms within a 7 kb long region around the Gln460Arg, including Ala348Thr (rs1718119), Thr357Ser (rs2230911), and Glu496Ala (rs3751143) variants. Since Gln460Arg is located at the 3' end of the P2RX7 gene, we included additional, potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 3' untranslated region (UTR), which can be in linkage with Gln460Arg. Based on in silico search, we chose two SNPs in putative microRNA target sites which are located in consecutive positions: rs1653625 and rs1718106.",Modafinil reduces amphetamine preference and prevents anxiety-like symptoms during drug withdrawal in young rats: Involvement of dopaminergic targets in VTA and striatum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664970,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 05 07,"Drug abuse and addiction are overwhelming health problems mainly during adolescence. Based on a previous study of our research group, the rats that received modafinil (MD) during the adolescence showed less preference for amphetamine (AMPH) in adulthood. Our current hypothesis is that MD will show beneficial effects against AMPH preference and abstinence symptoms during adolescence, a critical lifetime period when drug hedonic effects are more pronounced. We investigated the influence of MD pretreatment on AMPH preference in conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in adolescent rats and anxiety-like symptoms during drug withdrawal (48 h after the last AMPH dose) in elevated plus maze (EPM) task. Besides that, oxidative and molecular status were evaluated in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and striatum. Our findings showed, as it was expected, that adolescent animals developed AMPH preference together with anxiety-like symptoms during the drug withdrawal while the MD pretreatment prevented those behaviors. Besides promoting benefits on reward parameters, MD was able to preserve VTA and striatum from oxidative damages. This was observed by the increased catalase activity and reduced generation of reactive species and lipid peroxidation, which were inversely modified by AMPH exposure. At molecular level, MD exerted an interesting modulatory activity on the VTA and induced an up-regulation in striatal dopaminergic targets (TH, DAT, D1R and D2R). So far, during the adolescence, MD presented beneficial behavioral outcomes that could be attributed to its modulatory activity on the striatal dopaminergic system in an attempt to maintain the adequate dopamine levels.",Protection effect of polyols on Rhizopus chinensis lipase counteracting the deactivation from high pressure and high temperature treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664969,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"The influence of polyols on Rhizopus chinensis lipase (RCL) was investigated under high pressure. The poor stability of RCL was observed at 500 MPa at 60 °C without polyols which protected RCL against the loss of activity. The lipase is more stable in phosphate buffer than in tris buffer despite the protection of polyols. The activity was maintained 63% by the sorbitol of 2 mol/L in Tris-HCl buffer but 73% in phosphate buffer after the treatment at 500 MPa and 60 °C for 25 min. The same protective effects could be observed at 1 mol/L of sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, and mannitol. However, further increase of hydroxyl group number could not significantly improve the enzyme stability. The protection of polyols on RCL appears to depend on both of the polyol nature and the hydroxyl group number. Together with fluorescence spectra, circular dichroism spectra indicated that the chaotic conformation of RCL under high pressure became more ordered with 1 mol/L sorbitol. The results showed that sorbitol effectively stabilized the lipase conformation including the hydrophobic core under extreme conditions. It might be attributed to the interaction of polyols with RCL surface to modify intra-/intermolecular hydrogen bonds, maintaining the hydrophobic interactions within RCL.",A systematic reconsideration on proteases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664968,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 13,"Proteases are a group of large complex enzyme molecules that perform highly focused proteolysis functions. A vast quantity of the protease enzymes is predominantly sourced from microbial fermentation process, although proteases tend to natively present in plant, animals and humans. Proteases possess a pervasive importance in medical and pharmaceutical sector, because of its enriched specificity towards biomolecules. They are also actively encompassed in regulating certain physiological pathways. A distinct territory of human disorders is treated by substrate specific proteases. Enormous numbers of catalytic activities in habitual metabolism process of a living organism are protease dependent. Pilot scale researches and product development in industrial biotechnology sectors are wholly based on any one of the protease enzymes. The applications of the protease enzymes and its economic benefits of being an eco-friendly material are far-reaching.

The variable part of KL16 contains a module of genes for synthesis of 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid (5,7-di-N-acetylpseudaminic acid, Pse5Ac7Ac), a gene encoding ItrA3 that initiates the CPS synthesis with d-GlcpNAc, and two glycosyltransferase (Gtr) genes. The K16 CPS was studied by sugar analysis and Smith degradation along with 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and shown to be built up of linear trisaccharide repeats containing d-galactose (d-Gal), N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (d-GlcNAc), and Pse5Ac7Ac. The d-Galp residue is linked to the d-GlcpNAc initiating sugar via a β-(1 → 3) linkage evidently formed by a Gtr5 variant, Gtr5K16, encoded in KL16. This reveals an altered or relaxed substrate specificity of this variant as the majority of Gtr5-type glycosyltransferases have previously been shown to form a β-d-Galp-(1 → 3)-d-GalpNAc linkage. The β-Psep5Ac7Ac-(2 → 4)-d-Galp linkage is predicted to be formed by the other glycosyltransferase, Gtr37, which does not match members of any known glycosyltransferase family.","Preparation, physicochemical and pharmacological study of curcumin solid dispersion with an arabinogalactan complexation agent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664966,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 13,"Pharmaceutical solid dispersions (SD) of curcumin (Cur) with macromolecule polysaccharide arabinogalactan (AG) from wood of Larix sibirica were prepared by mechanical ball milling. The physical properties of the dispersed curcumin mixture in solid state were characterized by scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction studies. These methods showed a strong decrease in the degree of crystallinity of Cur and its transformation to amorphization state, accompanied by the formation of the guest-host type complexes. The behavior of the samples in solutions was characterized by reverse phase HPLC, 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Mechanochemically prepared complexes demonstrated the increased solubility of Cur up to ~10.5 times in contrast to pure curcumin. The rapid storage test showed high chemical stability of Cur, which depended on mass relations of Cur-AG. Besides, improved membrane permeability of Cur-AG SD was tested by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. Pharmacokinetic study of Cur-AG SD formulation in rat demonstrated a significant~8-fold enhancement of bioavailability in comparison to pure curcumin. In MTT tests, Cur-AG SD showed moderate cytotoxicity against human glioblastoma cells and immortalized human fibroblasts. Therefore, Cur-AG solid dispersion was a more promising and efficacious formulation for application in oral drug delivery.",Novel BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (ACP-196) tightly binds to site I of the human serum albumin as observed by spectroscopic and computational studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664965,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"Spectrofluorometric, UV-vis spectroscopic and theoretical tools were recruited to comprehend the interaction of acalabrutinib (ACP-196; ACLB) with human serum albumin (HSA). Fluorescence intensity determinations revealed that ACLB statically quenched the HSA-native fluorescence. Analysis of the observed fluorescence data resulting from the ACLB-HSA interaction presented binding constants in the range of 6.65-7.54 × 104 M-1 with the studied temperatures. Those constants showed steady decline with the rising temperatures that further signifies static interaction of the HSA and ACLB. Binding energetics were also interpreted using the fluorescence-recorded results that exhibited a spontaneous exothermic binding reaction with a negative change in Gibbs free energy as well as negative enthalpy and positive entropy changes. Those results suggested the involvement of electrostatic forces as discovered by further computational investigation. Those docking results verified that ACLB binds to domain IIA (site I) of the HSA as demonstrated experimentally by site markers displacement binding studies. Circular dichroism studies along with the synchronous and 3D fluorescence observations showed that ACL binding does not alter the HSA conformation.",KrasG12D mutation contributes to regulatory T cell conversion through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664964,Cancer letters,2019 02 04,"Genetic alterations have been attributed to the abnormal immune microenvironment in cancer. However, the relationship between the KrasG12D mutation and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study, we found that KrasG12D mutation status as determined by ddPCR correlated with high levels of Treg infiltration in resectable pancreatic cancer tissues. Compared to wild-type tumour cells, tumours cells with the KrasG12D mutation were associated with higher levels of Tregs, and knockout of the KrasG12D mutation reversed this effect. In addition, overexpression of the KrasG12D mutation in wild-type Kras tumour cells resulted in conversion of CD4+CD25- T cells into Tregs. We also found that in tumour cells, the KrasG12D mutation activated the MEK/ERK pathway, thereby up-regulating the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which induced Treg conversion. In summary, KrasG12D mutation plays a critical role in Treg conversion and contributes to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. These results provide new insights into the relationship between gene mutation and immune escape.","Pyrazinib (P3), [(E)-2-(2-Pyrazin-2-yl-vinyl)-phenol], a small molecule pyrazine compound enhances radiosensitivity in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664962,Cancer letters,2019 02 18,"Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is an aggressive disease with 5-year survival rates of <20%.

We identified pyrazinib (P3), a pyrazine phenol small molecule drug with anti-angiogenic and anti-metabolic activity in-vivo in zebrafish and in-vitro isogenic models of OAC radioresistance. Pyrazinib (P3) significantly inhibited blood vessel development in zebrafish (p < 0.001). In-vivo in zebrafish and in-vitro in an isogenic model of OAC radioresistance, pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced measures of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced the surviving fraction in OE33P; radiation-sensitive and OE33R; radiation-resistant cells following irradiation. Under hypoxic conditions pyrazinib (P3) significantly reduced OE33R cell survival following 4 Gy irradiation (p = 0.0216). Multiplex ELISA showed significantly higher secreted levels of 9 of 30 detected inflammatory and angiogenic factors in OE33R radioresistant cells compared to OE33P cells; IL-8, IL-4, IL-6, IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-10, MCP-1, IP-10, ICAM (p < 0.05).

Majorly, nanometals are used to facilitate the delivery of drug to targeted site, minimize drug's penetration to healthy tissues, increase drug's bioavailability, and inhibit its uptake and elimination from the blood by reticuloendothelial process. Despite several benefits, use of nanoparticles as drug carriers is also associated with many problems including instability in blood during circulation, undesirable biodistribution, and toxicity. Research has shown that modification in physicochemical properties including shape, size, and surface can develop a nanometal with desired properties but devoid of associated problems. This review introduces the clinical impact of important physicochemical properties of nanometals such as surface modification, shape, and size. Further, the review focuses on evidence reporting the impact of these properties on pharmacokinetics of nanometals with focus on gold, silver, and iron oxide due to their wide use in the medical field.",Newly isolated microorganisms with potential application in biotechnology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664944,Biotechnology advances,2019 04 08,"Nowadays, food, cosmetic, environmental and pharmaceutical fields are searching for alternative processes to obtain their major products in a more sustainable way. This fact is related to the increasing demand from the consumer market for natural products to substitute synthetic additives. Industrial biotechnology appears as a promising area for this purpose; however, the success of its application is highly dependent of the availability of a suitable microorganism. To overcome this drawback, the isolation of microorganisms from diverse sources, including fermented food, adverse environments, contaminated samples or agro-industrial wastes is an important approach that can provide a more adaptable strain able to be used as biocatalyst and that exhibit resistance to industrial conditions and high yields/productivities in biotechnological production of natural compounds. The aim of this review is to provide a solid set of information on the state of the art of isolation and screening studies for obtaining novel biocatalysts able to produce natural compounds, focusing in aromas, biosurfactants, polysaccharides and microbial oils.",Design of a randomized trial testing a multi-level weight-control intervention to reduce obesity and related health conditions in low-income workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664943,Contemporary clinical trials,2019 05 18,"Weight-control is a major public health focus for preventing multiple obesity-related health conditions. While clinic-based intensive lifestyle interventions are successful, low-socioeconomic-status (SES) populations, which have a higher burden of obesity, are difficult to reach; thus, the workplace offers a useful setting to target low-SES workers. The current paper presents the design of a study testing a workplace intervention aimed at low-SES employees. Partnering with a large healthcare system and affiliated university, this project will test an innovative multi-level intervention (""Working for You"") adapted from existing group- and individual-level intervention models to promote healthy weight among low-wage workers. The individual-level component is an interactive obesity treatment approach (iOTA) program that involves assessment of behavior risks, collaborative goal-setting with a health coach, and interactive SMS text-messages for ongoing support and self-monitoring. This mHealth intervention is embedded in the group-level component, a workplace participatory program that involves worker teams engaged in the design and implementation of interventions to change their workplace environments. These nested interventions are being tested in a group-randomized trial among 22 work groups (~1000 total workers, ~300 workers with obesity). The primary outcome will be program effects on weight at 2-year follow-up, compared to control, and the secondary outcomes will be effects on diet and physical activity; iOTA adherence, process measures, and work environment/support will also be examined. This pragmatic clinical trial will test scalable interventions that can be translated to other work settings to reduce obesity and related health risks among low-SES workers.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of individual differences in baseline and stress-induced changes in working memory (WM) on the shift to less goal-directed responding under stress. To this end, 112 healthy participants performed an instrumental learning task. In phase 1, participants learned instrumental actions that were associated with two different food rewards. In phase 2, one of these food rewards was devalued by eating until satiety. Before the extinction test in phase 3, participants were subjected to the Maastricht Acute Stress Test or a no-stress control procedure. Results showed that the effect of stress on instrumental behaviour is modulated by baseline, but not stress-induced changes in WM capacity. Specifically, only at low baseline WM capacity did stress induce a shift to less goal-directed behaviour. These findings highlight that our cognitive resources are limited and for those who already have limited resources at baseline taking into account motivational value is impaired under stress.",Transient inactivation of the visual-associative nidopallium frontolaterale (NFL) impairs extinction learning and context encoding in pigeons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664941,Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019 05 22,"Extinction learning is a fundamental learning process that enables organisms to continuously update knowledge about their ever-changing environment. When using visual cues as conditioned stimuli (CS), visual cortical areas of mammals are known to participate in extinction learning. The aim of the present study was to test whether similar processes can also be observed in birds. With pigeons as an animal model, we therefore investigated the role of the nidopallium frontolaterale (NFL), a key avian visual associative area, in an extinction learning task. We adopted a within-subject extinction task design with context manipulation, and tested the animals for extinction memory retention and renewal. Before extinction, the NFL was transiently inactivated by intracerebral tetrodotoxin (TTX) injections. Our data suggest that inactivation of NFL indeed produces a slowing of extinction learning. Importantly, NFL also plays a key role in context encoding, as indicated by an abolishment of the renewal effect. This is not due to an overall perceptual decrement, since the ability to distinguish between the different visual stimuli was unaltered, but might be caused by an impaired formation of the context-CS-configuration during extinction. Taken together, our experiment not only reveals similarities of neural substrates of extinction learning in birds and mammals, but also provides strong evidence for a specific contribution of the NFL in context encoding.",A steroid alkaloid derivative 02F04 upregulates thymic stromal lymphopoietin expression slowly and continuously through a novel Gq/11-ROCK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in mouse keratinocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664940,Cellular signalling,2019 03 06,"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a master switch of allergic inflammation, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Although many compounds upregulate TSLP expression in vivo or in vitro, most of them are pollutants or toxicants. In the previous study, for the first time, we found that a steroid alkaloid derivative 02F04, which has a unique skeletal structure compared with other TSLP-inducing chemicals, significantly induced TSLP production in mouse keratinocytes. However, it is not investigated thoroughly that how 02F04 produces TSLP and why. In this study, we did a detailed investigation on the inducible effect and underlying molecular mechanism of 02F04 on TSLP production. We found that the peak time of TSLP mRNA level induced by 02F04 at 48 h led to a slow and continuous TSLP production in PAM212 cells. Besides, 02F04-induced TSLP production was significantly suppressed by inhibitors of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha q/11 (Gq/11) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) at not only protein but also mRNA levels, and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gq or G11. This suggested that ROCK, Gq/11 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways were involved in 02F04-induced TSLP production. Increase in the level of p-ERK1/2 induced by 02F04 was suppressed by both inhibitors of ROCK and Gq/11, indicating that ROCK and Gq/11 molecules were located at the upstream of ERK1/2 to regulate 02F04-induced TSLP production. Gq/11 was located at the upstream of ROCK because the specific Gq/11 inhibitor of YM-254890 significantly reduced 02F04-induced actin stress fiber formation. Taken together, 02F04 upregulates a slow and continuous TSLP production through a novel Gq/11-ROCK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The thorough understanding the effect and mechanism of 02F04 on TSLP production is expected to supply it as a novel TSLP-regulating compound and a potential new tool for investigating the role of TSLP in allergic disorders.",Targeted RNA Sequencing in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664939,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,2019 03 03,This commentary highlights the article by Blidner et al that describes a novel assay for detection of chimeric RNAs from gene fusions and exon-skipping events in non-small-cell lung cancer.,Chemical neuroanatomy of the substantia nigra in the ovine brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664938,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,2019 03 23,"The substantia nigra is an integral component of the basal ganglia circuitry for limbic and motor functions.

Therefore, studies of the gross anatomy, cellular morphology, and neurochemical expression patterns within the sheep substantia nigra were performed. We show that the sheep substantia nigra reflects all important aspects of the anatomy and neurochemistry of the human substantia nigra, with only minor inter-species differences evident. Many neurochemicals that are central to the functioning of the SN, and wider basal ganglia circuitry, are present throughout the sheep SN.

Poor understanding of disease pathophysiology and incomplete representation of human disease in animal models hinder therapeutic drug development. Recent advances with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have enabled modeling of human diseases with patient-derived neural cells. Utilizing iPSC-derived neurons advances compound screening and evaluation of drug efficacy. These cells have the genetic backgrounds of patients that more precisely model disease-specific pathophysiology and phenotypes. Neural cells derived from iPSCs can be produced in a large quantity.

We queried the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Registry for 2006 to 2015 to analyze the outcomes of 102 patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) who underwent first HDT/ASCT. The median patient age was 54 years (range, 20 to 74 years), and 65 patients were treated in an upfront setting. With a median duration of follow-up of 44 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and progession-free survival (PFS) were 54.9% and 38.4%, respectively. There were no significant differences in OS and PFS between upfront and salvage HDT/ASCT. Because thiotepa, a key agent in HDT/ASCT for PCNSL, has been unavailable since 2011 in Japan, the HDT regimens used were not uniform. Thiotepa-containing HDT was received by 16 out of 32 patients before 2010, but by only 2 of 70 patients after 2011. Thiotepa-containing HDT was associated with better PFS (P = .019), lower relapse (P = .042), and a trend toward a survival benefit.

Development of AD is closely related to alterations of proteostasis including the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Molecular chaperones such as αB-crystallin (CryaB) can prevent aggregation of proteins and enable their correct refolding. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (MAPK) pathway regulates CryaB activity through phosphorylation of CryaB. Here, we examined CryaB and phospho-(p-)Ser59-CryaB protein amounts in the prefrontal cortex of the senescence-accelerated OXYS rats at different stages of the development of AD-like pathology and in Wistar rats (control). We compared this result with the changes in the expression of genes involved in the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex of both rat strains. Manifestation and progression of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats were accompanied by an increased level of detergent-insoluble p-Ser59-CryaB in the brain cortex, while the CryaB amount did not change. p-Ser59-CryaB was absent in the detergent-soluble protein fraction of the cortex in both rat strains. Immunostaining of brain slices revealed notable colocalization of p-Ser59-CryaB with Aβ in 18-month-old OXYS rats. According to RNA sequencing data, the development of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats is accompanied in the cortex by up- and downregulation of genes involved in p38 MAPK signaling. In general, we demonstrated that the manifestation AD-like pathology in OXYS rats occurs against the background of activation of p38 MAPK-dependent CryaB phosphorylation and alterations of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The increased p-Ser59-CryaB amount and its colocalization with Aβ can be considered a response to the accumulation of protein aggregates and may be an important part of an endogenous mechanism of AD development.",Injecting autologous platelet rich plasma solely into the knee joint is not adequate in treating geriatric patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664923,Experimental gerontology,2019 03 05,"Knee pain caused by osteoarthritis (OA) is commonly seen in geriatric patients. Patients with knee OA are often complicated with joint pain, soreness, and weakness. The injection of autologous platelet rich plasma (aPRP) has been proven to be effective in treating mild knee OA. The effect of injecting aPRP in treating moderate to severe degrees of knee OA remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of aPRP in treating patients with at least grade 2 on the Kellgren and Lawrence system for the classification of knee OA using a proteomic approach and clinical evaluation tool of Lequesne index. Musculoskeletal ultrasound was used for accurate needle placement into the knee joint, and to the perimeniscal soft tissue for the injection of aPRP. Three monthly aPRP injections were performed. Group 1 patients received intra-articular (IA) injection only, while group 2 received simultaneous IA and pes anserinus aPRP injections. After two monthly aPRP injections, both groups revealed significant drops in average SF total protein concentrations, and increases in the protein concentrations associated with chelation and anti-aging (eg/transthyretin, matrilin, and complement). However, it is group 2 that revealed significant decreases in the protein concentrations associated with inflammation (eg/immunoglobulin and apolipoprotein), and improved knee functional status. SF appeared to become less susceptible to degeneration after aPRP injections in group 2. As a result, at least 2 monthly injection of IA aPRP in conjunction with accurate injection of aPRP to the perimeniscal soft tissue structure such as the pes anserinus may be a viable option in treating patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA.",Chronic treatment with five vascular risk factors causes cerebral amyloid angiopathy but no Alzheimer pathology in C57BL6 mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664922,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 29,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder and the most common form of dementia coming along with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in more than 70% of all cases. However, CAA occurs also in pure form without AD pathology. Vascular life style risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, stress or an old age play an important role in the progression of CAA. So far, no animal model for sporadic CAA has been reported, thus the aim of the present study was to create and characterize a new mouse model for sporadic CAA by treatment with different vascular risk factors. Healthy C57BL6 mice were treated with lifestyle vascular risk factors for 35 or 56 weeks: lipopolysaccharide, social stress, streptozotozin, high cholesterol diet and copper in the drinking water. Four behavioral tests (black-white box, classical maze, cheeseboard maze and plus-maze discriminative avoidance task) showed impaired learning, memory and executive functions as well as anxiety with increased age. The treated animals exhibited increased plasma levels of cortisol, insulin, interleukin-1ß, glucose and cholesterol, confirming the effectiveness of the treatment. Confocal microscopy analysis displayed severe vessel damage already after 35 weeks of treatment. IgG positive staining points to a severe blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and furthermore, cerebral bleedings were observed in a much higher amount in the treatment group. Importantly, inclusions of beta-amyloid in the vessels indicated the development of CAA, but no deposition of beta-amyloid plaques and tau pathology in the brains were seen. Taken together, we characterized a novel sporadic CAA mouse model, which offers a strategy to study the progression of the disease and therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.",Consistent meal times improve performance on a daily time-place learning task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664921,Behavioural processes,2019 03 22,"The ability of an animal to learn the spatiotemporal variability of stimuli is known as time-place learning (TPL). The present study investigated the role of the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) in TPL. Rats were trained in an operant conditioning chamber which contained two levers that distributed a food reward, such that one lever provided food rewards in morning sessions, while the other lever provided food rewards in afternoon sessions. We expected that having access to the FEO would provide rats with more accurate depictions of time of day, leading to better performance. Rats received either one meal per day (1M group), which permitted FEO access, or many meals per day (MM group), which prevented FEO access. As predicted, 1M rats had a significantly higher percentage of correct first presses than MM rats. Once rats successfully learned the task, probe tests were conducted to determine the timing strategy used. Of the 10 rats that successfully learned the time-place discrimination, six used a circadian timing strategy. Future research should determine whether the advantage in learning seen in the rats having access to the FEO is specific to the daily TPL task used in this study, or to learning and memory tasks more generally.",Hemokinin-1 is an important mediator of pain in mouse models of neuropathic and inflammatory mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664920,Brain research bulletin,2019 03 15,"The Tac4 gene-derived hemokinin-1 (HK-1) is present in pain-related regions and activates the tachykinin NK1 receptor, but with binding site and signaling pathways different from Substance P (SP). NK1 receptor is involved in nociception, but our earlier data showed that it has no role in chronic neuropathic hyperalgesia, similarly to SP. Furthermore, NK1 antagonists failed in clinical trials as analgesics due to still unknown reasons. Therefore, we investigated the role of HK-1 in pain conditions of distinct mechanisms using genetically modified mice. Chronic neuropathic mechanical and cold hyperalgesia after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) were determined by dynamic plantar aesthesiometry and withdrawal latency from icy water, motor coordination on the accelerating Rotarod. Peripheral nerve growth factor (NGF) production was measured by ELISA, neuronal and glia cell activation by immunohistochemistry in pain-related regions. Acute somatic and visceral chemonocifensive behaviors were assessed after intraplantar formalin or intraperitoneal acetic-acid injection, respectively. Resiniferatoxin-induced inflammatory mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia by aesthesiometry and increasing temperature hot plate. Chronic neuropathic mechanical and cold hypersensitivity were significantly decreased in HK-1 deficient mice. NGF level in the paw homogenates of intact mice were significantly lower in case of HK-1 deletion. However, it significantly increased under neuropathic condition in contrast to wildtype mice, where the higher basal concentration did not show any changes. Microglia, but not astrocyte activation was observed 14 days after PSL in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of wildtype, but not HK-1-deficient mice. However, under neuropathic conditions, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was significantly smaller in case of HK-1 deletion. Acute visceral, but not somatic nocifensive behavior, as well as neurogenic inflammatory mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity were significantly reduced by HK-1 deficiency similarly to NK1, but not to SP deletion. We provide evidence for pro-nociceptive role of HK-1, via NK1 receptor activation in acute inflammation models, but differently from SP-mediated actions.

Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons results in muscle stiffness, uncoordinated body movements, sleep disturbance, fatigue, amnesia and impaired voice. Currently, levodopa (L-DOPA) administration is the most widely used therapy for PD. But prolonged administration of L-DOPA is associated with the symptoms of dyskinesia. However, emerging evidences suggest the role of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) in curtailing the progression of PD by activating neuroprotective pathways. Hence, cannabinoid therapy could be a promising alternative to combat PD in future. In the present review we have discussed the potential role of CBRs in attenuating the key mechanisms of PD and how the existing research gaps needs to be bridged in order to understand the molecular mechanism of CBRs in detail.",Machine learning as a supportive tool to recognize cardiac arrest in emergency calls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664917,Resuscitation,2019 05 07,"Emergency medical dispatchers fail to identify approximately 25% of cases of out of hospital cardiac arrest, thus lose the opportunity to provide the caller instructions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

However, limited cell source for dopaminergic precursors has become a major obstacle for transplantation therapy. Our group demonstrated previously that mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced dopaminergic precursors (iDPs) with high differentiation efficiency. In the current study, we hypothesized that a similar strategy can be applied to generate human iDPs for future cell therapy of PD. We overexpressed transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2 in human fibroblasts and observed formation of neurospheres. Subsequent characterization of the precursor colonies confirmed the generation of human induced dopaminergic precursors (hiDPs). These hiDPs were capable of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The hiDPs demonstrated high immunoreactivity for neural progenitor markers and high levels of gene expression for ventral mesencephalon-related neural progenitor markers such as Lmx1a, NIKX6.1, Corin, Otx2 and Mash1. Furthermore, the hiDPs could be differentiated into dopaminergic neurons with ˜80% efficiency, which significantly increased major functionally relevant proteins such as TH, DAT, AADC, Lmx1B, and VMAT2 compared to hiDPs. Additionally, hiDPs are more dopaminergic progenitor-restricted compare to those hiDP-like cells reprogrammed only by Brn2 and Sox2. Together, these results suggest that hiDPs with high differentiation efficiency can be generated by direct lineage reprogramming of fibroblasts with transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2.

The limits of quantitation (LOQs) of both target compounds in two matrixes were reduced to 0.0001 mg/kg. Dissipative dynamics experiments indicated that afidopyropen residue dissipation is more consistent with a two-compartment kinetic model than a first-order kinetic model whether in cucumber or nectarine. The half-lives were less than 1.1 and 2.0 days in the distribution phase and up to 9.9 and 27.7 days in the elimination phase in cucumber and nectarine, respectively. The correlation coefficients were 0.9620, 0.9391, and 0.9923 for cucumber and 0.9676 and 0.9985 for nectarine from different locations. M440I007 initially increased rapidly, reached a maximum at 2 days, and then decreased gradually over time. Finally, dietary risk assessment indicated that the mixed residues of afidopyropen and M440I007 at the recommended dosage would not cause health concerns in population.","Effective tool for assessment of the quality of barrier creams - relationships between rheological, textural and sensory properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664900,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 05 20,"The efficiency of barier creams (BC) in the prevention of occupational skin diseases is closely related to their mechanical, rheological but also sensory properties. The measurement procedure we elaborated, which simulates the spreadability conditions on the skin and evaluation whether the structure reconstruction occurs (hysteresis loop test, shear rate dependence of normal force), allows the assessment of the effectivness of the BC in terms of mechanical resistance and its adhesion to the skin surface. In this thesis an effort was made to define the impact of the human factor - the product application on skin - on the efficiency of medical devices for cutaneous use. Creams' performance such as the spreadability or the feeling on the skin during and after application, which mostly determine users willingness to use them systematically and rigorously, have been linked to parameters obtained during the structure analysis and to rheological properties. Moreover an attempt has been made to correlate the values of basic textural properties with rheological parameters determined by viscoelasticity and classic flow analysis.

In the present work, the characterization of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Schistosoma mansoni (SmDHODH) is presented. Our studies demonstrated that SmDHODH is a member of class 2 DHODHs and catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate into orotate using quinone as an electron acceptor by employing a ping-pong mechanism of catalysis. SmDHODH homology model showed the presence of all structural features reported for class 2 DHODH enzymes and reveal the presence of an additional protuberant domain predicted to fold as a flexible loop and absent in the other known class 2 DHODHs. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ligand-free forms of SmDHODH and HsDHODH undergo different rearrangements in solution. Well-known class 2 DHODH inhibitors were tested against SmDHODH and HsDHODH and the results suggest that the variable nature of the quinone-binding tunnel between human and parasite enzymes, as well as the differences in structural plasticity involving rearrangements of the N-terminal α-helical domain can be exploited for the design of SmDHODH selective inhibitors, as a strategy to validate DHODH as a drug target against schistosomiasis.",Protocatechuic acid improves functional recovery after spinal cord injury by attenuating blood-spinal cord barrier disruption and hemorrhage in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664898,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 23,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption and hemorrhage lead to blood cell infiltration and progressive secondary injuries including inflammation. Inflammatory response is one of the major events resulting in apoptosis, scar formation and neuronal dysfunction after SCI. Here, we investigated whether protocatechuic acid (PCA), a natural phenolic compound, would attenuate BSCB disruption and hemorrhage, leading to functional improvement after SCI. After a moderate contusion injury at T9, PCA (50 mg/kg) was administrated via intraperitoneal injection immediately, 6 h, and 12 h after SCI, and the same dose of PCA once a day until 7 d after injury. Our data show that PCA inhibited apoptotic cell death of neurons and oligodendrocytes and improved functional recovery after injury. PCA also attenuated BSCB disruption and hemorrhage and reduced the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages compared to vehicle control. Moreover, PCA inhibited the expression and activation of matrix metalloprotease-9, which is well known to disrupt BSCB after SCI. Furthermore, PCA treatment significantly inhibited the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 and transient receptor potential melastatin 4, which are known to mediate hemorrhage at an early stage after SCI. Consistent with these findings, the mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and chemokines was significantly alleviated by PCA treatment. Thus, our results suggest that PCA improved functional recovery after SCI in part by inhibiting BSCB disruption and hemorrhage through the down-regulation of sulfonylurea receptor 1/transient receptor potential melastatin 4 and matrix metalloprotease-9.",Directed expression of halophilic and acidophilic β-glucosidases by introducing homologous constitutive expression cassettes in marine Aspergillus niger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664896,Journal of biotechnology,2019 04 15,"The hydrolysis step by β-glucosidase (BGL) is generally recognized as the major limiting step in cellulose degradation and the BGLs with prominent enzymatic properties are of great importance for efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. In order to identify some salt-tolerant BGLs, two BGL genes were cloned from marine Aspergillus niger ZJUBE-1 genome. Then two bgl expression cassettes driven by gpdA promoter were respectively transformed into marine A. niger for homologous constitutive expression. Directed expression was achieved for the domination of target BGLs in fermentation broth. Conveniently, two BGLs were purified to homogeneity by two separation steps, ultrafiltration and anion exchange chromatography. The purified BGL1 and BGL2 showed maximum activity at pH 3.0-4.0 and 3.5-4.5, respectively, suggesting these two BGLs were relatively acidophilic, especially for BGL1. Besides, BGL1 was stable to most of metal ions, while BGL2 was sensitive to Cu2+, Fe3+ and Ag+. Most specially, BGL2 activity increased by 44% in the presence of 4 M NaCl, suggesting BGL2 was halophilic. Homology modeling revealed that longer loops and linkers as well as polymerous Glu492 may contribute to the halophilism of BGL2.

Much less effort has been made to better understand the role of potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Here we summarize the current understanding of regulatory cell populations in the context of chronic inflammation, namely macrophages, Langerhans cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T and B lymphocytes. Emphasis is given to the skin because many different immune-related diseases occur in the skin. Development, phenotype, function, and evidence for their role in animal models of inflammation, as well as in the corresponding human diseases, are described.

The auditory cortex is essential to analyse the identity and the behavioural importance of tones paired with emotional events. On the contrary, whether the auditory cortex may also encode information on the emotional-motivational valence of sounds is much more controversial. Here, we reviewed recent studies showing that the activity of cortical neurons reflects information about the content of emotional stimuli paired with tones. Critically, the blockade of these neuronal processes prevents animals from recognising sounds as aversive or pleasant. Based on these findings, we proposed a conceptual model in which the auditory cortex may incorporate ascending information from subcortical nuclei about the valence of sounds in sound representations and may consequently drive the activity of subcortical structures towards emotionally laden tones. This hypothesis may also have important implications in the characterisation of neural circuits engaged by maladaptive affective disorders, such as phobias."

Proteasome substrates are typically marked by ubiquitination for recognition at receptor sites contributed by Rpn1/S2/PSMD2, Rpn10/S5a, and Rpn13/Adrm1. Each receptor site can bind substrates directly by engaging conjugated ubiquitin chains or indirectly by binding to shuttle factors Rad23/HR23, Dsk2/PLIC/UBQLN, or Ddi1, which contain a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) that adopts the ubiquitin fold. Previous structural studies have defined how each of the proteasome receptor sites binds to ubiquitin chains as well as some of the interactions that occur with the shuttle factors. Here, we define how hRpn10 binds to the UBQLN2 UBL domain, solving the structure of this complex by NMR, and determine affinities for each UIM region by a titration experiment. UBQLN2 UBL exhibits 25-fold stronger affinity for the N-terminal UIM-1 over UIM-2 of hRpn10. Moreover, we discover that UBQLN2 UBL is fine-tuned for the hRpn10 UIM-1 site over the UIM-2 site by taking advantage of the additional contacts made available through the longer UIM-1 helix. We also test hRpn10 versatility for the various ubiquitin chains to find less specificity for any particular linkage type compared to hRpn1 and hRpn13, as expected from the flexible linker region that connects the two UIMs; nonetheless, hRpn10 does exhibit some preference for K48 and K11 linkages. Altogether, these results provide new insights into the highly complex and complementary roles of the proteasome receptor sites and shuttle factors.",A Nucleotide-Dependent Conformational Switch Controls the Polymerization of Human IMP Dehydrogenases to Modulate their Catalytic Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664871,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 25,"Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo GTP biosynthetic pathway and plays essential roles in cell proliferation. As a clinical target, IMPDH has been studied for decades, but it has only been within the last years that we are starting to understand the complexity of the mechanisms of its physiological regulation. Here, we report structural and functional insights into how adenine and guanine nucleotides control a conformational switch that modulates the assembly of the two human IMPDH enzymes into cytoophidia and allosterically regulates their catalytic activity. In vitro reconstituted micron-length cytoophidia-like structures show catalytic activity comparable to unassembled IMPDH but, in turn, are more resistant to GTP/GDP allosteric inhibition. Therefore, IMPDH cytoophidia formation facilitates the accumulation of high levels of guanine nucleotides when the cell requires it. Finally, we demonstrate that most of the IMPDH retinopathy-associated mutations abrogate GTP/GDP-induced allosteric inhibition and alter cytoophidia dynamics.",Tau Modulates VGluT1 Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664870,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Tau displacement from microtubules is the first step in the onset of tauopathies and is followed by toxic protein aggregation. However, other non-canonical functions of Tau might have a role in these pathologies. Here, we demonstrate that a small amount of Tau localizes in the nuclear compartment and accumulates in both the soluble and chromatin-bound fractions. We show that favoring Tau nuclear translocation and accumulation, by Tau overexpression or detachment from MTs, increases the expression of VGluT1, a disease-relevant gene directly involved in glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Remarkably, the P301L mutation, related to frontotemporal dementia FTDP-17, impairs this mechanism leading to a loss of function. Altogether, our results provide the demonstration of a direct physiological role of Tau on gene expression. Alterations of this mechanism may be at the basis of the onset of neurodegeneration.","Center Finding in E. coli and the Role of Mathematical Modeling: Past, Present and Future.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664868,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 25,"We review the key role played by mathematical modeling in elucidating two center-finding patterning systems in Escherichia coli: midcell division positioning by the MinCDE system and DNA partitioning by the ParABS system. We focus particularly on how, despite much experimental effort, these systems were simply too complex to unravel by experiments alone, and instead required key injections of quantitative, mathematical thinking. We conclude the review by analyzing the frequency of modeling approaches in microbiology over time. We find that while such methods are increasing in popularity, they are still probably heavily under-utilized for optimal progress on complex biological questions.",Metal Toxicity Links to Alzheimer's Disease and Neuroinflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664867,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 23,"As the median age of the population increases, the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the associated socio-economic burden are predicted to worsen. While aging and inherent genetic predisposition play major roles in the onset of AD, lifestyle, physical fitness, medical condition, and social environment have emerged as relevant disease modifiers. These environmental risk factors can play a key role in accelerating or decelerating disease onset and progression. Among known environmental risk factors, chronic exposure to various metals has become more common among the public as the aggressive pace of anthropogenic activities releases excess amount of metals into the environment. As a result, we are exposed not only to essential metals, such as iron, copper, zinc and manganese, but also to toxic metals including lead, aluminum, and cadmium, which perturb metal homeostasis at the cellular and organismal levels. Herein, we review how these metals affect brain physiology and immunity, as well as their roles in the accumulation of toxic AD proteinaceous species (i.e., β-amyloid and tau). We also discuss studies that validate the disruption of immune-related pathways as an important mechanism of toxicity by which metals can contribute to AD. Our goal is to increase the awareness of metals as players in the onset and progression of AD.",Rate of Submandibular Gland Involvement in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664866,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,2019 05 03,Whether the submandibular gland (SMG) can be preserved during neck dissection in the surgical treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is controversial.

Many patients are demanding esthetic and metal-free treatment alternatives, including those requiring orthognathic surgery (OGS), to correct their dentofacial deformities. The adoption of performing OGS for CAT has been cautious and challenging for many reasons. Intermaxillary fixation, postoperative occlusal control, preoperative decompensation management, and long-term stability need to be tested and assessed. This report presents an accurate 3-dimensional (3D) printed hard acrylic splint specifically for patients without any orthodontic attachment to be used in the positioning and fixation of osteotomized jaws.

Recent studies have shown that the key enzyme of estrogen synthesis (aromatase) is detected in the skeletal muscle. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on the expression of aromatase and the synthesis of sex steroid hormones in skeletal muscle following exercise training. Ovariectomized rats were divided into two groups, treadmill running group (25 m/min, 60 min/day, 6 days/week) and sedentary group. We found that in ovariectomized rats, exercise training significantly increased the soleus and plantar muscles mass. The level of aromatase expression and 17-β-estradiol (E2) were increased significantly in skeletal muscle following exercise training. In addition, activation of the down-stream Akt-FoxO1-MyoD signaling pathway was significantly increased in both soleus and plantaris muscles following exercise. These results demonstrate that exercise training increased the expression of aromatase and local estrogen production in skeletal muscle, which potentially influences skeletal muscle in ovariectomized rats through activation of the Akt-FoxO1-MyoD signaling pathway.",Spexin/NPQ Induces FBJ Osteosarcoma Oncogene (Fos) and Produces Antinociceptive Effect against Inflammatory Pain in the Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664863,The American journal of pathology,2019 03 24,"Spexin/NPQ is a novel highly conserved neuropeptide. It has a widespread expression in the periphery and central nervous system. However, the effects of central spexin on acute inflammatory pain are still unknown. This study explored the mechanisms and effects of supraspinal spexin on inflammatory pain. The results from the mouse formalin test show that i.c.v. administration of spexin decreased licking/biting time during the late and early phases. The nonamidated spexin had no effect on pain response. The antinociception of spexin was blocked by galanin receptor 3 antagonist SNAP 37889. The Galr3 and Adcy4 mRNA levels in the brain were increased after injection with spexin. The antinociceptive effects of spexin were completely reversed by opioid receptor antagonist naloxone and κ-opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride. Spexin up-regulated the dynorphin and κ-opioid receptor gene and protein expression. PCR array assay and real-time PCR analysis show that spexin up-regulated the mRNA level of the FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos). T-5224, the inhibitor of c FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-Fos)/activator protein 1 (AP-1), blocked the increased mRNA level of Pdyn and Oprk1 induced by spexin. I.C.V. spexin (2.43 mg/kg) increased the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in most subsections of periaqueductal gray. In addition, in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, i.c.v. spexin produced an antinociceptive effect. Our results indicate that spexin might be a novel neuropeptide with an antinociceptive effect against acute inflammatory pain.",Sost Haploinsufficiency Provokes Peracute Lethal Cardiac Tamponade without Rescuing the Osteopenia in a Mouse Model of Excess Glucocorticoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664862,The American journal of pathology,2019 04 14,"Glucocorticoid-induced secondary osteoporosis is the most predictable side effect of this anti-inflammatory. One of the main mechanisms by which glucocorticoids achieve such deleterious outcome in bone is by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Sclerostin, encoded by Sost gene, is the main negative regulator of the proformative and antiresorptive role of the Wnt signaling pathway in the skeleton. It was hypothesized that the partial inactivation of sclerostin function by genetic manipulation will rescue the osteopenia induced by high endogenous glucocorticoid levels. Sost-deficient mice were crossed with an established mouse model of excess glucocorticoids, and the effects on bone mass and structure were evaluated. Sost haploinsufficiency did not rescue the low bone mass induced by high glucocorticoids. Intriguingly, the critical manifestation of Sost deficiency combined with glucocorticoid excess was sporadic, sudden, unprovoked, and nonconvulsive death. Detailed histopathologic analysis in a wide range of tissues identified peracute hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade to be the cause. These preclinical studies reveal outcomes with direct relevance to ongoing clinical trials that explore the use of antisclerostin antibodies as a treatment for osteoporosis. They particularly highlight a potential for increased cardiovascular risk and may inform improved stratification of patients who might otherwise benefit from antisclerostin antibody treatment."

The molecular basis of DMD lies in the absence of the protein dystrophin, which plays critical roles in mechanical membrane integrity and protein localization at the sarcolemma. A popular mouse model of DMD is the mdx mouse, which lacks dystrophin and displays mild cardiac and skeletal pathology that can be exacerbated to advance the disease state. In clinical and pre-clinical studies of DMD, angiotensin signaling pathways have emerged as therapeutic targets due to their adverse influence on muscle remodeling and oxidative stress. Here we aim to establish a physiologically relevant cardiac injury model in the mdx mouse, and determine whether acute blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) may be utilized for prevention of dystrophic injury.",EPAI-NC: Enhanced prediction of adenosine to inosine RNA editing sites using nucleotide compositions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664849,Analytical biochemistry,2019 02 17,"RNA editing process like Adenosine to Intosine (A-to-I) often influences basic functions like splicing stability and most importantly the translation. Thus knowledge about editing sites is of great importance in molecular biology. With the growth of known editing sites, machine learning or data centric approaches are now being applied to solve this problem of prediction of RNA editing sites. In this paper, we propose EPAI-NC, a novel method for prediction of RNA editing sites. We have used l-mer composition and n-gapped l-mer composition as features and used Pearson Correlation Coefficient to select features according to Pareto Principle. Locally deep support vector machines were used to train the classification model of EPAI-NC. EPAI-NC significantly enhances the prediction accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods when tested on standard benchmark and independent dataset.",Repeated mild traumatic brain injury causes persistent changes in histone deacetylase function in hippocampus: Implications in learning and memory deficits in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664848,Brain research,2019 03 22,"Impaired attention and memory represent some of the major long-term consequences of brain injuries. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of brain trauma-induced cognitive decline. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the hippocampus are believed to impact learning and memory. Herein, we have induced repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rMTBI) in rats by using weight-drop paradigm, examined the recognition memory using novel object recognition task, and assessed the HDAC activities in the hippocampus post 48 h and 30 days of rMTBI. The recognition memory was significantly compromised in the rMTBI-exposed rats at both the time points. The rMTBI increased mRNA levels of different isoforms of HDACs (HDAC2-5 and HDAC11) at different time points coupled with rise in nuclear and cytosolic HDAC activities. However, a mild decrease in HDAC8 mRNA levels was observed at 30 days time point. As a corollary, rMTBI also caused persistent decrease in the levels of acetylated histone H3-Lys 9 (H3-K9ac) in promoter region of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) gene with concurrent decline in CART mRNA and peptide (CARTp) levels. Furthermore, the treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), a pan HDAC inhibitor, restored the rMTBI-induced deficits in recognition memory and HDAC activities with commensurate changes in the H3-K9ac and CART mRNA levels. Together, these results suggest that rMTBI may trigger persistent changes in HDAC-mediated histone acetylation at the CART gene promoter culminating into deficits in learning and memory. Further, the present study also identifies therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors in rescuing MTBI-induced cognitive deficits.",In vitro phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) binding in whole hemisphere human brain using the PET radioligand [18F]MNI-659.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664847,Brain research,2019 03 22,"Highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for pathologies related to dysfunctions in the basal ganglia circuit are of great value to assess therapeutic efficacy not only clinically to establish an early diagnosis, but also in terms of monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and decelerated neurodegeneration. The phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) enzyme plays a central role in striatal signaling and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders involving striatal pathology, such as Huntingtońs disease (HD) and schizophrenia. Inhibition of PDE10A activates the neurons in the striatum and consequently leads to alteration of behavioral aspects modulated by the striatal circuit.

Here we aimed to assess the effects of PWSI on aggressiveness and social behavior in both male and female rats. Furthermore, we evaluated how PWSI affects the central oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) systems in both sexes. Wistar rats were isolated (IS) or group housed (GH) in same-sex groups immediately after weaning. After seven weeks, rats underwent an intruder test to assess aggression. In one group, brains were immediately dissected afterwards for in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography. The other group underwent additional anxiety-like and social behavior tests. PWSI induced increased (abnormal) aggression and impaired social memory in both sexes. Especially IS females exhibited abnormal aggression towards juveniles. Furthermore, PWSI increased OXT mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and decreased OXTR binding in the anterior portion of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), independent of the sex. V1a receptor binding was decreased in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and dentate gyrus (DG) in IS rats, regardless of sex. However, V1a receptor binding in the anterior portion of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNSTa) was decreased in IS females but increased in IS males. Taken together, our data support PWSI as a reliable model to exacerbate aggression not only in male but also in female rats. In addition, OXT receptors in the NAcca and V1a receptors in the LH, DG, and BNSTa may play a role in the link between PWSI and aggression.

In this context, the hyperactivity of the cardiac Na+/H+ (NHE-1) exchanger plays a key role. The pathologic remodeling of the myocardium constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality with continuously increasing healthcare cost. Therefore, the development of better therapeutic strategies emerges as highly mandatory. Our goal was to prevent angiotensin II (ANGII)-induced cardiac hypertrophy by NHE-1 gene silencing in Wistar rats. The intramyocardial injection of a lentivirus coding a specific small interference RNA (l-shNHE1) significantly reduced NHE-1 expression exclusively in the heart (~ 50%) and prevented cardiac remodeling in rats exposed to chronic infusion of ANG II (heart weigh/tibia length: 24,03 ± 0,7915 mg/mm vs 28,45 ± 0,9779 mg/mm and collagen volume fraction 2526 ± 0,5003 vs 5982 ± 1043 in l-shNHE1 + ANGII and ANGII, respectively).

Phase 3 clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and tolerability of N9-GP for the prevention and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia B. Recent studies have shown that PEGylation affects clotting times in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one-stage activity assays due to interaction between the FIX molecule and certain aPTT reagents. In recognition of the challenges surrounding FIX activity assessment, the identification of consistent, reproducible and accurate assays to measure FIX activity has been a priority for Novo Nordisk, running in parallel to the clinical development program for N9-GP. N9-GP activity can be reliably measured using chromogenic substrate assays and specific aPTT reagents. The conjugation of the PEG moiety to the FIX molecule may affect one-stage aPTT-based clotting assays in a reagent-dependent manner. Many aPTT reagents that use silica as the contact activator dramatically overestimate N9-GP activity due to premature activation. On the other hand, the contact activator in some other aPTT reagents negatively affects the enzymatic activity of FXIa, causing the underestimation of N9-GP activity. While N9-GP activity cannot be measured consistently with all available aPTT reagents, accurate N9-GP measurements can be achieved with certain aPTT reagents. Here, we review the studies that led to these findings and summarize the current options for accurate measurement of N9-GP in patient samples.",Novel TG-FGFR1 and TRIM33-NTRK1 transcript fusions in papillary thyroid carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664823,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",2019 06 01,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is most common among all thyroid cancers.

Considering heterogeneous ARID1A expression, we validated this using whole tissue sections (n = 159) and found that loss of ARID1A was correlated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and PD-L1 positivity. Furthermore, for patients with MSI-H tumors, the degree of PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in ARID1A-deficient tumors. After ARID1A knockdown in GC cell lines, total and membranous PD-L1 protein, and PD-L1 mRNA levels were increased based on Western blot, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR, respectively. With IFN-γ treatment, PD-L1 expression was significantly increased both in ARID1A-deficient cancer cells and controls, but the increase was not more pronounced in the former. Loss of ARID1A increased PD-L1 via activating AKT signaling, while LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) decreased PD-L1 levels. Furthermore, we found that 3 MSI-H tumors showing highest expression of PD-L1 had simultaneous KRAS mutation and loss of ARID1A, suggesting a possible synergistic role boosting PD-L1. Our results strongly indicate that loss of ARID1A is tightly associated with high PD-L1 expression in GC. These results would increase our understanding of the oncogenic mechanism of PD-L1 regulation in GC, and also help to find the optimal candidates for immunotherapy.",Center variation in screening for and management of metabolic syndrome in pediatric liver transplant recipients: A survey of SPLIT centers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664821,Pediatric transplantation,2019 01 31,"PTMS-a clustering of hypertension, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance/diabetes, and obesity-is increasingly recognized as a contributor to long-term morbidity after transplant.

This paper presents a practical solution for this challenge by transferring the G-nerve agents from the organic phase into the aqueous phase using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), followed by derivatization with 2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenol (2-DMAMP), allowing ultrasensitive LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of the G-derivatives. The proposed approach enables rapid identification of trace amounts of G-nerve agents with limits of identification (LOIs) at the pg/mL scale."
