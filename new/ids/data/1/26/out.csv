Strengthening Human Resource (HR) practices and adopting HR technologies such as Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), that can collect, store and report workforce data are often described as a potential solution to this problem. Indeed, examples from other industries show that HRIS can help to launch or manage, as well as provide ongoing insights concerning the whole career cycle of an employee. However, few of the existing studies that discuss technology or its impacts on the future of work have focused on health organizations, and those that do have not received sufficient attention in health literature. Furthermore, such contributions as there have been have either prioritized a particular type of technology or focused mainly on the effect of automation on health professionals' work. They have thus overlooked the full range of possible uses of these technologies and, specifically, have neglected the topic of HR for Health (HRH) management in health organizations. The primary aim of this paper is to address this lacuna, with specific reference to the existing categorization of HR technological disruptions. To conclude, health organizations and the health and HR professionals who work within them need to use HRIS responsibly, finding a balance between the drive for innovation, productivity and efficiency and respect for all potential legal, ethical and compliance issues, as well as taking account of the importance of HRH wellbeing and satisfaction.",The use of self-management strategies for problem gambling: a scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035978,BMC public health,2019 06 10,"Problem gambling (PG) is a serious public health concern that disproportionately affects people experiencing poverty, homelessness, and multimorbidity including mental health and substance use concerns.

At the time of presentation, she had been in remission from a stage 2a ductal breast carcinoma for 58 months. The clinical presentation was suggestive of a primary pancreas cancer with liver metastases and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. We performed liver and pancreas biopsies that demonstrate a relapse of her old breast carcinoma with positive hormone receptors and HER2 positive. Conservative treatment by chemotherapy was given with Paclitaxel - Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab. Pancreatic metastases are uncommon. Furthermore, pancreatic metastases from breast cancer are very rare. We performed a review of the literature and found 48 cases of pancreatic metastases from breast cancer. We would like to highlight by this case that when a pancreatic lesion appears, in patients with a past history of cancer, physicians must not forget the possibility of metastases from primary tumor even if the initial stage, of the tumor, is low. However the diagnosis is not always easy. If liver and pancreatic lesions occur simultaneously, the clinical presentation can mimic metastatic primary pancreatic cancer. Therefore performing biopsy is highly recommended for making the correct diagnosis and also for the staging of the disease and the choice of the best treatment according to immunohistochemical analysis.",Baseline Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Stroke Recurrence During Secondary Prevention With Pravastatin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035902,Stroke,2019 05 28,"Background and Purpose- As a prespecified post hoc analysis of the J-STARS (Japan Statin Treatment Against Recurrent Stroke) Echo Study, the 5-year stroke recurrence rate according to the baseline mean carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) with and without pravastatin treatment was investigated. Methods- Patients were randomly assigned to receive pravastatin 10 mg/day (pravastatin group) or control group (nonstatin treatment; 1:1) for 5 years. Baseline mean IMT of the common carotid artery was measured by ultrasonography. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate whether the stroke (any ischemic stroke, atherothrombotic brain infarction, or lacunar infarction) recurrence rate was different according to tertiles of baseline mean IMT. Results- A total of 793 patients, including 388 in the pravastatin group and 405 in the control group, were investigated. In the control group, Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest tertile IMT group (≥0.931 mm) had a higher rate of atherothrombotic brain infarction than those in the lowest tertile IMT group (<0.812 mm; [hazard ratio, 9.08; 95% CI, 1.15-71.43]). Patients in the pravastatin group had a lower risk of atherothrombotic brain infarction than those in the control group only in the highest tertile IMT group by the log-rank test ( P value=0.045). Conclusions- Long-term pravastatin administration may prevent the occurrence of atherothrombotic brain infarction in noncardioembolic infarction patients with the highest tertile IMT.

However, there are few data on use of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or outcomes in this population. Methods- Using data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry between February 2009 and September 2017 (n=1619 hospitals), we examined characteristics and outcomes among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator within the 3- to 4.5-hour window who had a history of stroke plus diabetes mellitus (HxS+DM) (n=2129) versus those without either history (n=16 690). Results- Compared with patients without either history, those with both prior stroke and DM treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator after an acute ischemic stroke had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in addition to history of stroke, DM, and more severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: median, 8 [interquartile range, 5-15] versus 7 [4-13]). The unadjusted rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and in-hospital mortality were 4.3% (HxS+DM) versus 3.8% (without either history; P=0.31) and 6.2% versus 5.5% ( P=0.20), respectively. These differences were not statistically significant after risk adjustment (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage: adjusted odds ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.51-1.21]; P=0.28; in-hospital mortality: odds ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.52-1.14]; P=0.19). Unadjusted rate of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) at discharge was lower in those with HxS+DM (30.9% HxS+DM versus 44.8% without either history; P≤0.0001), and this difference persisted after adjusting for baseline clinical factors (adjusted odds ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.59-0.99]; P=0.04). Conclusions- Among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator within the 3- to 4.5-hour window, HxS+DM was not associated with statistically significant increased symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or mortality risk.",Validation of Wall Enhancement as a New Imaging Biomarker of Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035900,Stroke,2019 05 28,"Background and Purpose- High-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging is a promising technique for assessing wall structures of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). However, the relationship between aneurysmal high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging features and their histopathologic mechanism remains poorly understood. Methods- From February 2016 to February 2018, a total of 19 men and 28 women with 54 UIAs treated surgically were prospectively enrolled. The intraoperative observed gross pathology of the aneurysmal wall was compared with the enhancement features on high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging. Specimens of the UIAs were harvested for histopathologic and immunohistochemistry analysis. Results- An irregular shape and large size was significantly related to UIA wall enhancement. Both uniform and focal wall enhancement may demonstrate the inflammation processes of UIA walls, although the latter may indicate more atherosclerotic plaque formation. Conclusions- Different high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging enhancement features may represent variable inflammation status of a UIA wall, which may provide new insights into assessing the UIA wall structure and optimizing treatment.",Brush Sign Is Associated With Increased Severity in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035899,Stroke,2019 05 28,"Background and Purpose- The brush sign (BS) is an abnormally accentuated signal drop of the subependymal and deep medullary veins in paramagnetic-sensitive magnetic resonance sequences, previously described in acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to describe the BS in patients with thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses and explore its association with clinical severity, thrombosis extent, parenchymal brain lesion, and clinical prognosis. Methods- We assessed consecutive adult patients admitted to 2 university hospitals with diagnosis of acute thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses and imaging assessment with magnetic resonance imaging, including paramagnetic-sensitive sequences. Demographics, imaging findings, clinical presentation, and functional outcome at 3 months were analyzed according to the presence of BS. Results- In 118 patients included, BS was observed in gradient-echo T2*weighted (T2*WI) in 16% and susceptibility-weighted imaging in 13% of cases. All patients with BS had thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus, or deep venous system. BS was associated with ipsilateral parenchymal lesion (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.9-21.1; P=0.002) and higher thrombus load (median [interquartile range] 5 [4-6] versus 2 [2-4]); P<0.0001). BS was also associated with focal neurological deficits (OR 4.2; 95%CI, 1.4-12.7, P=0.01). The functional outcome at 3 months was not significantly different in patients with BS. Conclusions- BS in T2*WI and susceptibility-weighted imaging was observed in approximately one in 7 patients with acute thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses. BS was significantly associated with ipsilateral parenchymal brain lesion, extent of thrombosis, and manifestation with focal neurological deficits. This suggests that BS can represent a marker of severity in thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses.",Does Small Vessel Disease Burden Impact Collateral Circulation in Ischemic Stroke Treated by Mechanical Thrombectomy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035898,Stroke,2019 05 28,"Background and Purpose- The development of leptomeningeal collateral artery network might be adversely affected by small vessel wall alteration. We sought to determine whether small vessel disease (SVD) burden may impact collateral development in patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Methods- The patients admitted in our center for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke and (1) treated by mechanical thrombectomy with or without thrombolysis and (2) who underwent a baseline magnetic resonance imaging were included in the study. The SVD burden and the pial collaterality were assessed through the cerebral SVD score (severe when ≥1) and the Higashida score (favorable when ≥ 3) on magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography, respectively. Any association between the cerebral SVD score and the collaterality were assessed through comparative and regression analyses. Results- Between January 2013 and March 2018, 240 patients met the inclusion criteria (68.7±16.1 years old; 49.2 % female). The cerebral SVD scores were of 0 in 125 (52.1%), 1 in 74 (30.8%), 2 in 30 (12.5%), and 3 in 11 (4.6%) patients. Hundred and thirty-six patients (58.1%) presented a favorable collaterality score. The favorable collaterality subgroup presented a significantly higher proportion of female (79%), lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( P<0.001), and higher Diffusion-Weighted Imaging-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores ( P<0.001). The regression analyses showed no impact of the cerebral SVD score on the collaterality pattern (odds ratio, 1.11, 95% CI, 0.82-1.50; P=0.51).

Hydro-dissection was previously showed to separate median nerve and deep structures during percutaneous ultrasound guided transverse carpal ligament release. This cadaveric study aims to demonstrated effectiveness and safety of closed transverse carpal ligament (TCL) release though the mini-transverse incision at distal wrist crease combined with hydrodissection technique. Neither special instrument nor retractor was used to protect neurovascular structures. Methods: Twelve fresh frozen cadaveric wrists were included in this study. Completeness of TCL release and injury to the adjacent neurovascular structures were assessed by direct visualization. Thickness of TCL, TCL length and distance from incision to adjacent neurovascular structures were also recorded. Results: Complete release of TCL was demonstrated in all 12 (100%) wrists underwent the mini-transverse incision TCL release at distal wrist crease and hydro-dissection technique. No injury to the adjacent neurovascular structures was found in all 12 wrists. Mean of thickness of TCL and TCL length were 3 mm and 28.7 mm, respectively. The ulnar artery was the nearest structure to the incision (mean = 3.7 mm). Conclusions: The closed mini-transverse incision TCL release at distal wrist crease with hydro-dissection technique demonstrated completeness of TCL division and safety to the neurovascular structures without protecting retractor or special instrument.",Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Associated with Bifid Median Nerve and Palmaris Profundus - Case Report and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035882,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,The anatomic variations of the median nerve and of the muscles of the wrist have been widely reported in literature. It is essential for the surgeon to be familiar with these variations in order to avoid accidental injury to the nerve during surgery. We report a rare case of bifid median nerve accompanied by an anomalous tendon of palmaris profundus discovered during the surgical release of carpal tunnel. The transverse carpal ligament was dissected and the anomalous tendon was left in situ because any direct compression over the median nerve was noticed intraoperatively. The patient was evaluated one year postoperatively clinically and radiologically (with MRI). At the follow up the resolution of symptoms was complete and the sleep disturbance was solved. The patient achieved a postoperative QuickDASH score of 9.1 and a Michigan Hand Questionnaire outcome score of 90 points.,A Subperiosteal Proximal Phalanx Osteoid Osteoma: A Challenging Diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035881,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"A relatively rare tumor, osteoid osteoma most commonly affects the lower extremity. In 10% of the cases, it can affect the hand and wrist. We present a case of osteoid osteoma in the proximal phalanx of ring finger that was initially misdiagnosed as a soft tissue lesion. The soft tissue lesion was resected, but the symptoms recurred shortly thereafter, leading to repeat diagnostic workup. Despite X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and tissue biopsy, the diagnosis remained elusive until surgical re-exploration. Based on the lessons learned from this case and the experience reported in literature, we discuss the intricate nature of osteoid osteoma diagnosis in the hand, the obstacles often encountered, and how to approach these challenging patients in a stepwise and critical fashion.",Extensor Carpi Ulnaris Tendon Anatomy May Mimic Tears.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035880,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: Asymptomatic, incidental extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon abnormalities are frequently noted on imaging studies of the wrist. The aim of this investigation was to determine if variations in gross tendon anatomy existed that could possibly account for these findings on MRI and ultrasound (US) imaging. Methods: The upper extremities of eleven (6 male and 5 female) formalin preserved cadavers were dissected and examined under loupe magnification with attention to the dorsal-ulnar wrist and hand and the ECU tendon. The tendons were inspected for anatomic variations, degenerative changes, and any other pathologies. The presence of intra-tendinous splits arising within the ECU tendon was noted and measured. The distances of the splits from the distal tendon insertion and the edge of the extensor retinaculum were recorded. Statistical correlations between age and the tendon splits were considered using R-squared to assess a linear regression. Results: 17 ECU tendons were dissected and examined, and 5 ECU tendons were excluded due to poor preservation of that upper extremity; all five were right sided upper extremities. Eleven of the 17 specimens demonstrated at least one split in the distal tendon: Seven had 1 split, 1 had 2 splits, and 3 had 3 splits. The mean length of the tendon split was 3.52 cm. The mean distance of the distal edge of the split to the tendon insertion site was 2.4 cm. A linear regression was calculated and showed no correlation between age and number of tendon splits. Conclusions: 64% of specimens showed a longitudinal split in the distal ECU tendon. The location of these frequent splits corresponds to imaging abnormalities on MRI and US in prior studies.",Efficacy of Primary Repair in Professional Athletes with Chronic Radial Collateral Ligament Injuries of Thumb Metacarpophalangeal Joint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035879,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: Management of grade III injuries of the radial collateral ligament (RCL) of the thumb is controversial. These injuries are often treated with early surgery. However, early surgery may not be practical for the professional athlete. We report on the outcome of delayed primary repair of chronic RCL injuries without the use of tendon grafts or tendon transfers. Methods: Twelve elite professional athletes with 15 soft tissue RCL injuries who underwent delayed surgery (greater than 6 weeks) were included in this study. Athletes were managed with splinting and ongoing play during the sporting season, and underwent surgery at the conclusion of the season. Mean duration from injury to surgery was 5 months. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years after surgery. Patient-report outcome measures including pain, satisfaction rating, and disability of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scores were collected. Examination findings including range of motion, laxity, and grip and pinch strength were also measured. Return-to-play data were collected for all athletes. Results: The RCL was able to be primarily repaired with suture anchors in all cases. All twelve patients were able to return to competitive play at the same pre-injury professional level. Post-operative joint function such as range of motion and laxity were comparable to the unaffected contralateral side, as were grip and lateral pinch strengths. Tip-pinch strength is lower compared to the unaffected side, but is comparable to age and sex-matched reference group. Conclusions: Delayed primary repair of the RCL is a viable option and results in satisfactory long-term outcomes. This option may be more preferable to the professional athlete who wishes to avoid surgery during the sporting season.",Surgical Treatment of Distal Radius Fractures under the Ultrasound-Guided Brachial Plexus Block Performed by Surgeons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035878,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: The upper limb surgery under the ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block is becoming popular due to its safety, effectiveness, and convenience. However, the uneven distribution of anesthesiologists become a social problem. Ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block by surgeons has been widespread especially in hand surgeons. We report the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures under the ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block performed by surgeons in our hospital. Methods: The subjects were 101 patients (41 males and 60 females, average age 61.6 years) who underwent surgery for distal radius fractures under ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block administered by orthopedists at our university or related facilities between January 2014 and June 2016. Brachial plexus block was administered through the supraclavicular approach. The time from initiation of anesthesia to initiation of surgery, mean operative time, the presence or absence of additional anesthesia (local infiltration anesthesia, intravenous anesthesia, and general anesthesia), and complications were evaluated. Results: The mean time from brachial plexus block to initiation of surgery was 35.7 (20-68) minutes, and the mean operative time was 90.5 (35-217) minutes. Surgery was completed with brachial plexus block alone in 62 patients (61.4%), and additional anesthesia was necessary in 39 patients (38.6%). Furthermore, general anesthesia was employed in 6 patients (5.9%). No serious complications occurred. Conclusions: According to our results, the operation could be completed with brachial plexus block alone and additional local infiltration anesthesia or intravenous anesthesia in 94.1% (95 cases). However, 6 cases (5.9%) shifted to general anesthesia. Although it needs training, we consider that hand surgery including distal radius fractures treatment under the ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block is possible. On the other hand, cooperation or a cooperative system with anesthesiologists is necessary for surgeons to administer this anesthesia.",Evolving Threat of Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Upper Extremity Infections in the South Pacific: 2011-2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035877,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) rates have been increasing worldwide and contribute to a growing ""global health security threat"" as reported by the WHO. Our group previously reported an overall rate of 7% in CA-MRSA upper extremity infections between 2004-2009 at the Auckland Regional Hand Unit. This fell below the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendation for empiric antimicrobial cover once local rates exceed 10-15%. We examined prevalence and characteristics of CA-MRSA upper extremity infections in our region over a subsequent 5-year period. Methods: One thousand two hundred and fifty-two patients with upper extremity infections requiring operative management between 2011 and 2015 inclusive were included in this study. Associated clinical characteristics were recorded including ethnicity, cultured organisms, antibiotic sensitivities, infection rate, and treatment practice. Results: One hundred and fifty (12%) of patients had culture positive CA-MRSA upper extremity infections. There was an increasing annual trend. Of note, rates of CA-MRSA in the Maori and Pacific Island ethnic subpopulations exceeded 15% in 2014 and 2015. Susceptibilities, associated factors and patient demographics are reported. Conclusions: Our unit enjoys significantly lower rates of CA-MRSA upper extremity infections than has been reported internationally. However, trends are increasing relative to our prior 6-year report, and the threshold for empiric treatment has been met within the Maori and Pacific Island ethnic subpopulations. This evolving threat is also highlighted by increasing cases of multi-drug resistant CA-MRSA. Evolving regional guidelines for empiric coverage of CA-MRSA among high-risk ethnic subpopulations identified by this study are underway.",Seasonal Variation in Hand and Upper Limb Soft Tissue Infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035876,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: Hand and upper limb soft tissue infections result in significant disability and loss of productivity. Many infections have been shown to follow a seasonal variation, however little is known about this is the context of upper limb soft tissue infections. We aimed to evaluate seasonal variation in acute bacterial, hand and upper limb skin and soft-tissue infections, and correlate findings with key environmental variables. Methods: Hand and upper limb soft tissue infection cases from 2006-2016 were retrieved from a single UK center. Cases were reviewed for microbiology culture and sensitivity. Correlation between cases and season, temperature and humidity was assessed. Results: 206 cases were identified for inclusion. Specimens were sent for microbiology in 76.4% of cases. Of these 78.9% were culture positive, 47.6% exhibited antibiotic resistance and 16.9% were multi-resistant. There was a significant difference between season and culture positive cases, with significantly more culture positive cases in the summer vs. winter on post-hoc analysis (p = 0.004). There was a significant positive correlation between higher temperatures and number of culture positive cases (r = 0.75). There was no significant correlation between temperature and antibiotic resistance (r = 0.5) or between humidity and culture positive cases (r = -0.42). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a seasonal variation in hand and upper limb infections, with a significant correlation between infection rates and ambient temperature. Appreciating seasonal variability of these infections could prove beneficial for surgical planning, public health recommendations and antibiotic guidelines. However, further international data is needed to understand potential mechanisms involved.",Are Flexor Tendon Ruptures Ever Spontaneous? - A Literature Review on Closed Flexor Tendon Ruptures of the Little Finger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035875,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: When closed ruptures of flexor tendons of fingers occur, there is often an identifiable pathology, which should be addressed in the same surgical setting as the tendon repair. The concept of ""spontaneous"" tendon rupture, occurring in the absence of identified pathology, however, has also been reported in a significant number of papers. This controversy has prompted us to do a review of the existing literature. Methods: We did a review of cases of closed ruptures of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) of the little finger in existing literature. Fifty-three publications were retrieved by searching ""FDP tendon rupture"" and ""little finger"" using PubMed database. We analyzed data such as the zone of rupture noted intra-operatively; and any precipitating factors, pathology or trauma. We also conducted a review on papers which discussed the concept of ""spontaneous rupture"". Results: Fifty-three publications were retrieved. There were 8 cases of ruptures in Zone I; 2 in Zone II; 30 in Zone III; 59 in Zone IV and 5 in Zone V. Majority of cases were associated with an element of trauma of varying severity, or pathology. A precipitating cause was not documented in 12 cases. Amongst all 36 cases of ruptures labelled as ""spontaneous"", only 1 case was truly ""spontaneous"" without any associated trauma or pathology. Conclusions: Most reports labeled as spontaneous rupture occurred in Zone III, where tendon ruptures are rare. There are documented pathological causes or evidence of trauma to most of these cases. We conclude these ruptures may have been mislabeled as spontaneous ruptures. Bearing in mind the propensity for tendon excursion, we suspect the lack of documentation of exploration in proximal zones contributed to this mislabeling. Understanding this concept of non-spontaneity to most tendon ruptures and the common sites of rupture or pathology is crucial for a surgeon to make strategic incisions and minimize future recurrence.",An Assessment of Sleep Disturbance in Patients before and after Carpal Tunnel Release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035874,The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,2019 04 30,"Background: Night time numbness is a key characteristic of CTS and relief of night time symptoms is one of the outcomes most important to patients. This study tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference between sleep quality and night symptoms before and after carpal tunnel release (CTR). Methods: Forty-four, English-speaking adult patients requesting open CTR for electrodiagnostically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome completed questionnaires before and after surgery. Average age was 59, 24 patients were men and 20 were women. Patient with a primary or secondary sleep disorder were excluded. Before surgery, patients completed the Pittsburg Sleep Quality index (PSQI). At an average of 3 months after surgery, participants completed PSQI questionnaires. Onset of sleep quality improvement was specifically addressed. Differences between preoperative and postoperative sleep quality were evaluated using the paired t-test. Spearman correlations were used to assess the relationship between continuous variables. Results: Of the 44 patients, 32 (72%) were classified as poor sleepers (PSQI > 5.5) prior to surgery. At 3 months follow up, there was a significant improvement PSQI global scores (7.8 ± 5.1 vs 4 ± 3.5, p < 0.001) as well as subdivisions. Daytime dysfunction (0.2 ± 0.4, p < 0.001) and medication use (1.0 ± 1.2 vs 0.9 ± 1.2, p < 0.045) secondary to sleep disturbance and was improved as well. In all patients, onset of improvement was within 24 hours of surgery. Conclusions: CTR is associated with improvement in sleep quality at 3 months follow-up. CTR improves daytime dysfunction related to the sleep disturbance. The onset of sleep improvement is 24 hours after surgery in most cases."

However, it is not known whether this preference is specific to faces or reflects a more generalised preference in biological stimuli: for example, non-face body parts. Moreover, it is not yet well established whether the preference for carotenoid colouration extends beyond Caucasian populations. Three studies were conducted to address these issues. In Studies 1 and 2, Caucasian and Hong Kong Chinese participants, respectively, selected the more attractive image in pairs of high and low carotenoid colouration versions of images of Caucasian faces and body parts, and also for non-face/body-part control stimuli (scrambled faces). In Study 3, a similar study protocol was used with an independent sample of Hong Kong Chinese participants using stimuli generated from Chinese individuals. The results showed that high carotenoid colouration was preferred across all the three studies in faces and body parts, but not in the control stimuli. In addition, there was a stronger preference for high carotenoid colouration in faces compared with body parts in Studies 1 and 2-although this preference was not observed in Study 3. Overall, these findings demonstrate that higher levels of skin carotenoid colouration are preferred both in face and body parts, but not in non-face stimuli, and that these preferences are evident in Caucasian and Hong Kong Chinese individuals.",Mice Lacking Brain-Derived Serotonin Have Altered Swallowing Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035861,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 30,"The intricate sensorimotor neural circuits that control swallowing are heavily reliant on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]); however, the impact of 5-HT deficiency on swallow function remains largely unexplored. We investigated this using mice deficient in tryptophan-hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in 5-HT synthesis. Videofluoroscopy was utilized to characterize the swallowing function of TPH2 knockout ( TPH2-/-) mice as compared with littermate controls ( TPH2+/+). Results showed that 5-HT deficiency altered all 3 stages of swallowing. As compared with controls, TPH2-/- mice had significantly slower lick and swallow rates and faster esophageal transit times. Future studies with this model are necessary to determine if 5-HT replacement may rescue abnormal swallowing function. If so, supplemental 5-HT therapy may have vast applications for a large population of patients with a variety of neurologic disorders resulting in life-diminishing dysphagia, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, for which 5-HT deficiency is implicated in the disease pathogenesis.",Statistical inference problems in sequential parallel comparison design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035859,Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,2019 04 30,"The sequential parallel comparison designhas recently been considered to solve the problem with high placebo response and the required sample size in the psychiatric clinical trials. One feature with this design is that a difference between the placebo group and the drug group may also arise in the variance-covariance structure of the clinical outcome. Provided the heterogeneity of the second moment, the treatment effect estimation at the second stage can be biased for the entire randomized patient population that includes patient responders. Our work presented here aims at how the coverage probability of the interval estimation of treatment effect performs under the unstructured variance-covariance matrix. The interaction between the truncation after the first stage and the heterogeneity of the second moment causes a substantial coverage probability problem. The type I error probability may not be controlled under the weak null due to this bias. This bias can also cause spurious power evaluation under an alternative hypothesis. The coverage probability of the ordinary least square statistic is shown in different scenarios.",Factors Influencing Poor Outcomes in Synthetic Tissue-Engineered Tracheal Replacement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035858,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 30,"Humans receiving tissue-engineered tracheal grafts have experienced poor outcomes ultimately resulting in death or the need for graft explantation.

While effects with respect to ethnic origin, age, or gender are known, the inter-individual variability of miRNAs across the four seasons remained largely hidden. We sequentially profiled the complete repertoire of blood-borne miRNAs for 25 physiologically normal individuals in spring, summer, fall, and winter (altogether 95 samples) and validated the results on 292 individuals (919 samples collected with the Mitra home sampling device) by RT-qPCR. Principal variance component analysis suggests that the largest variability observed in miRNA expression is due to individual variability and the individuals' gender. But the results also highlight a deviation of miRNA activity in samples collected during spring time. Following adjustment for multiple testing, remarkable differences are observed between spring and fall (77 miRNAs). The two most dys-regulated miRNAs were miR-181c-5p and miR-106b-5p (adjusted p-value of 0.007). Other significant miRNAs include miR-140-3p, miR-21-3p, and let-7c-5p. The dys-regulation was validated by RT-qPCR. Systems biology analysis further provides strong evidence for the immunological origin of the signals: dys-regulated miRNAs are enriched in CD56 cells and belong to various signalling and immune-system-related pathways. Our data suggest that besides known confounding factors such as age and sex, also the season in which a test is conducted might have a considerable influence on the expression of blood-borne miRNAs and subsequently might interfere with diagnosis based on such signatures.",Consequences of maternal postpartum depression: A systematic review of maternal and infant outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035856,"Women's health (London, England)",2019 05 09,The postpartum period represents the time of risk for the emergence of maternal postpartum depression.

The identification of drug targets is highly challenging, particularly for diseases of the brain. To address this problem, we developed and experimentally validated a general computational framework for drug target discovery that combines gene regulatory information with causal reasoning (""Causal Reasoning Analytical Framework for Target discovery""-CRAFT). Using a systems genetics approach and starting from gene expression data from the target tissue, CRAFT provides a predictive framework for identifying cell membrane receptors with a direction-specified influence over disease-related gene expression profiles. As proof of concept, we applied CRAFT to epilepsy and predicted the tyrosine kinase receptor Csf1R as a potential therapeutic target. The predicted effect of Csf1R blockade in attenuating epilepsy seizures was validated in 3 preclinical models of epilepsy. These results highlight CRAFT as a systems-level framework for target discovery and suggest Csf1R blockade as a novel therapeutic strategy in epilepsy.

Cumulative results suggest that nanostructured lipid carrier could be an effective, alternative and promising lipid-mediated oral drug delivery approach than solid lipid nanoparticles.",Filling accuracy and imprecision of commercial evacuated sodium citrate coagulation tubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035815,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 05 09,"Current recommendations advocate that blood tubes for coagulation testing should be filled not less than 90% of their nominal filling volume, since under- or over-filling >10% may generate unreliable results of some hemostasis assays. This study was hence aimed to explore filling accuracy and precision of commercial blood tubes. Between-lot variations of 3 different lots (20 tubes per lot) of 3.2% citrate blood tubes manufactured by Becton Dickinson, Greiner and Kima were studied. One additional lot from each manufacturer was assessed in triplicate (three series of 20 tubes), to assess within-lot variation. All tubes were first weighed empty and then filled with distilled water by a syringe, under ideal filling conditions. Filled tubes were weighed again, in duplicate. For each 20 tubes series, mean bias (deviation from the ideal tube filling volume) and imprecision (coefficient of variation; CV%) were calculated. All biases were within ±10%. Within-lot and between-lot variation in filling volume was acceptable, and comprised between 0.4 and 2.4%. Greiner tubes were the most accurate (bias, -1.0 to 2.4%), followed by Kima (bias, -7.8 to -5.9%) and Becton Dickinson (bias, -9.6 to 3.3%) tubes. The highest between-lot difference was noted for Becton Dickinson tubes (up to 12.9%), followed by Greiner and Kima tubes (up to 3.4 and 1.8%, respectively). Although coagulation tubes filling accuracy was within ±10% for all three tested manufacturers, the overall bias was found to be variable among manufacturers and lots. Major effort shall be made by blood tube manufacturers for improving standardization of their products.","Testing a model of reward sensitivity, implicit and explicit drinker identity and hazardous drinking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035814,Psychology & health,2019 04 30,"The aim of this study was to investigate both implicit and explicit drinker identity as mediators of reward sensitivity and problematic drinking. University students engage in problematic levels of alcohol consumption, exposing them to increased negative health outcomes. Although personality traits (e.g. reward sensitivity) and social-cognitive variables (e.g. implicit and explicit drinker identity) have been used to investigate drinking behaviour, few studies link personality and multiple indices of drinker identity to problematic drinking.",Accuracy of genotyping for HPV16 and 18 to triage women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions: a pooled analysis of VALGENT studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035813,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,2019 05 27,"Background: Genotyping for the most carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types (HPV16/HPV18) can identify high risk of underlying cervical precancer and guide further management. Research design and methods: A pooled analysis was performed of the clinical accuracy of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing and HPV16/18 genotyping in triage of women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). Data regarding 24 assays evaluated in four VALGENT validation panels were used. Results: In women with LSIL, hrHPV had a pooled sensitivity for CIN2+ of 95.5% (95% CI: 91.0-97.8%) and a specificity of 25.3% (95% CI: 22.2-28.6%). HPV16/18 genotyping had a sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+ of 52.9% (95% CI: 48.4-57.4%) and 83.5% (95% CI: 79.9-86.5%), respectively. The average risk of CIN2+ was 46.1% when HPV16/18-positive, 15.5% in women who were HPV16/18-negative but positive for other hrHPV types and 4.3% for hrHPV-negative women. Conclusions: Triage of women with LSIL with HPV16/18 genotyping increases the positive predictive value compared to hrHPV testing but at the expense of lower sensitivity. Arguably, women testing positive for HPV16/18 need further clinical work-up. Whether colposcopy referral or further surveillance is recommended for women with other hrHPV types may depend on the post-test risk of precancer and the local risk-based decision thresholds.",Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Mimicking Cellulitis: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035812,The international journal of lower extremity wounds,2019 04 30,"Cellulitis is one of the most misdiagnosed disease, which could be lethal when misdiagnosed. There are a lot of diseases to consider in differential diagnosis of cellulitis. Especially when conventional treatment with antibiotics does not seem to work, other radiological examinations and biopsy should be considered to find out what is causing the symptoms. Our case presents a patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma, who was first thought to have had cellulitis but was later found to have malignancy.

However, MSCs can be affected by hypoxia and nutritional deficiency due to a lack of blood vessels in the scaffolds. Here, we explored the effects of hypoxia on MSC differentiation to clarify these mechanisms. Methods: Peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) were cultured in small individual chambers with oxygen concentrations of 1%, 9%, and 21%. Cell proliferation was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit 8 assays, and cell survival was determined using live/dead assays. Scratch assays were performed to evaluate cell migration. Ca2+ deposition/mineralization experiments, reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting were performed to assess the osteogenic differentiation of cells. Notch1 expression was downregulated by lentivirus-transfected PBMSCs to observe the effects of Notch1 knockdown on osteogenic gene and protein expression. Results: PBMSCs exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) demonstrated accelerated proliferation, increased migration, and reduced survival in the absence of serum. Although 9% oxygen promoted osteogenic differentiation, the osteogenic differentiation of PBMSCs was significantly reduced by 1% O2, and this effect was associated with increased Notch1 expression. Reducing Notch1 expression using small interfering RNA significantly restored the osteogenic differentiation of PBMSCs. Conclusions: Hypoxia accelerated proliferation, increased migration, and reduced PBMSC differentiation into osteoblasts by increasing Notch1 expression. These findings may contribute to the development of appropriate cell culture or in vivo transplantation conditions to maintain the full osteogenic potential of PBMSCs.",It's all relative: Increasing organ donor registration intentions by maximizing family-relevant vested interest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035810,Journal of health psychology,2019 04 30,"Guided by vested interest theory, the impact of educating potential organ donors about the beneficial experiences afforded to families of deceased donors was assessed. Participants were informed about these benefits by taking a survey that asked them to indicate both their awareness, and the appeal, of numerous existing benefits (e.g. grief services). We employed a double-sided mixed design. Both the true experimental design and the quasi-experimental repeated assessment indicated increased registration intentions. Only the quasi-experimental design indicated significant attitude change. This study provides evidence supporting the potential utility of focusing interventions on the benefits afforded to donor families.",Rating the intelligibility of dysarthic speech amongst people with Parkinson's Disease: a comparison of trained and untrained listeners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035809,Clinical linguistics & phonetics,2019 04 30,Intelligibility of speech is a key outcome in speech and language therapy (SLT) and research. SLT students frequently participate as raters of intelligibility but we lack information about whether they rate intelligibility in the same way as the general public. This paper aims to determine if there is a difference in the intelligibility ratings made by SLT students (trained in speech related topics) compared to individuals from the general public (untrained). The SLT students were in year 2 of a BSc programme or the first 6 months of a MSc programme. We recorded 10 speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) related speech reading aloud the words and sentences from the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech. These speech recordings were rated for intelligibility by 'trained' raters and 'untrained' raters. The effort required to understand the speech was also reported. There were no significant differences in the measures of intelligibility from the trained and untrained raters for words or sentences after adjusting for speaker by including them as a covariate in the model. There was a slight increase in effort reported by the untrained raters for the sentences. This difference in reported effort was not evident with the words. SLT students can be recruited alongside individuals from the general public as naïve raters for evaluating intelligibility in people with speech disorders.

A wide range of humoral factors for RIP have been proposed including hydrophobic peptides, opioid peptides, adenosine, prostanoids, endovanilloids, endocannabinoids, calcitonin gene-related peptide, leukotrienes, noradrenaline, adrenomedullin, erythropoietin, apolipoprotein, A-I glucagon-like peptide-1, interleukin 10, stromal cell-derived factor 1, and microRNAs. Virtually, all of the components of ischemic preconditioning's signaling pathway such as nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase C, redox signaling, PI3-kinase/Akt, glycogen synthase kinase β, ERK1/2, mitoKATP channels, Connexin 43, and STAT were all found to play a role. The signaling pattern also depends on which remote vascular bed was subjected to ischemia and on the time between applying the rip and myocardial ischemia occurs. Because there is convincing evidence for many seemingly diverse humoral components in RIP, the most likely explanation is that the overall mechanism is complex like that seen in ischemic preconditioning where multiple components are both in series and in parallel and interact with each other. Inhibition of any single component in the right circumstance may block the resulting protective effect, and selectively activating that component may trigger the protection. Identifying the humoral factors responsible for RIP might be useful in developing drugs that confer RIP's protection in a more comfortable and reliable manner.",Prescription Patterns and Outcomes of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Treated With Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Warfarin: A Real-World Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035795,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 04 30,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been found to be similar or superior to warfarin in reducing ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

The purpose of this study was to characterize HIV-positive women's use of ambulatory and acute mental health services in the first year postpartum, relative to HIV-negative women. Using health administrative data, we identified 861,365 women who had a live birth delivery from April 1, 2002 to March 31, 2012 in Ontario, Canada, of whom 530 were identified to be HIV-positive. We described their use of mental health services, including outpatient mental health visits, psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). HIV-positive women were more likely to access outpatient mental health services (31.5% vs. 21.0%, aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03-1.55), but more likely to remain engaged in psychiatrist services only (15.6% vs. 6.5%, aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.41-3.72). They were also more likely to require a psychiatric ED visit or hospitalization (3.3% vs. 1.1%, aOR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.72-4.12).

The Role of Hospice Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035790,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,2019 04 30,"The effect of hospice care on place of death among centenarians remained unexplored. Using data obtained from National Health Insurance Research Database (2002-2010), we compared the differences in place and cause of death between centenarians and noncentenarians. These data were stratified into centenarian (n = 2495) and noncentenarian (n = 820 563) death. Data in place and cause of death and hospice care interventions were retrieved. Poisson regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with the centenarians' place of death. Time series models were used to predict the number of centenarian deaths until 2025. Most (63.8%) of the centenarians died at their own homes, followed by 30.5% who died in hospital. Hospice home care was involved in only 0.3% of the centenarian deaths but in 1.8% of the noncentenarian deaths. The leading causes of death among centenarians were respiratory diseases (16.6%), circulatory diseases (15.2%), and pneumonia (14.8%). Among the centenarians, those who died of circulatory disease, old age, and respiratory diseases were more likely to die at their own homes. We forecasted the number of annual centenarian deaths to reach 800 in 2025. Therefore, an increase in the provision of advanced care planning and earlier home hospice care intervention may enable centenarians to die at their own residence.",Enteral Tranexamic Acid Decreases Proteolytic Activity in the Heart in Acute Experimental Hemorrhagic Shock.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035788,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 04 30,"The mechanisms for cardiac injury after hemorrhagic shock (HS) are unresolved. We hypothesize that remote organ damage can be caused by uncontrolled pancreatic proteolytic activity, as enteral protease inhibition improves outcomes in experimental HS. Uncontrolled proteolysis in the heart may disrupt cardiac metabolism and adrenergic control with subsequent deleterious outcomes. To test this hypothesis, the heart rate-pressure product (RPP) as an index of myocardial oxygen consumption and the levels of fatty acid transporter proteins CD36 and FATP6 as surrogates for metabolic activity in the heart were measured in rats subjected to experimental HS (n = 6/group) with and without the enteral protease inhibitor tranexamic acid (TXA). Plasma troponin I and heart fatty acid-binding protein (HFABP) concentrations were measured as indices of myocardial damage. Expression of the adrenergic receptors β1, α1D, and β2 was also measured in the heart to determine the possible effects of shock with and without enteral TXA on the adrenergic control of heart function. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 35 mm Hg for 2 hours before reperfusion of shed blood. The RPP was maintained in shocked animals treated enterally with TXA but not in those subjected to HS alone; this group also demonstrated decreased HFABP and plasma troponin I levels. Serine protease (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity was elevated in cardiac tissue and plasma after HS and abrogated by enteral TXA. Levels of CD36, FATP6, β1, α1D, and β2 were also increased after HS in cardiac tissue, and the increases were mitigated by TXA treatment. These results suggest that increased proteolytic activity may contribute to cardiac injury after HS. Enteral TXA prevents these changes, indicating a potential therapeutic option in the management of shock with resultant cardiac injury.",When Better Seems Bigger: Perceived Performance of Adult Professional Football Players Is Positively Associated With Perceptions of Their Body Size.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035787,Evolutionary psychology : an international journal of evolutionary approaches to psychology and behavior,2019 04 30,"Research has shown a positive association between cues of physical formidability and perceptions of status, supporting a generic ""bigger-is-better"" heuristic. However, does better also lead to appraisals as bigger? Recent research suggests that the perceptual association between body size and social status can also be explained in terms of prestige. To test whether perceptions of prestige lead to higher appraisals of body size, we examined whether people apply a ""better is bigger bias"" (BBB) in football, where performance and body size tend to be uncorrelated. In two studies, we examined real coalitional sports groups on a national (Study 1) and team level (Study 2), and we manipulated target performance in an experimental third study. Results suggest that perceived performance significantly predicted both the perceived height (Studies 2 and 3) and perceived weight (Studies 1 and 2) of professional football players, supporting the BBB. Support for the team had a positive effect on body size estimations of the players; however, we did not find any support for winner or loser effects. We discuss these results in light of individual versus team performance and coalitional affiliation.",Effect of Intranasal Corticosteroids on Secondary Sinonasal Symptoms: A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035786,American journal of rhinology & allergy,2019 04 30,"Intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) sprays are indicated for use in the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and include aqueous and nonaqueous formulations.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is not a commonly preferred anesthetic agent for tympanoplasty because this agent may increase middle ear pressure and displace the graft. In this study, we researched the surgical outcomes of the underlay tympanoplasty performed with N2O anesthesia. Patients who underwent tympanoplasty were included in this prospective study. A type 1 tympanoplasty was performed in all patients using the underlay technique. Patients were randomized to groups that did and did not receive N2O. Preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds were evaluated, postoperative pain scores were recorded, and the differences between the groups were statistically evaluated. There were 44 patients who received N2O and 44 who did not. The graft success rate was 93.2% in the N2O-receiving group and 84.1% in the nonreceiving group ( P > .05). Hearing levels improved significantly after surgery in each group ( P < .05), but the difference between the groups was not significant ( P > .05). The postoperative pain score was 3.72 ± 1.3 in the N2O-receiving group and 4.45 ± 2.3 in the nonreceiving group ( P > .05). Nitrous oxide is a cheap, safe, and readily available anesthetic agent that provides acceptable success rates in patients undergoing tympanoplasty."

Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 African American women who received prenatal care at a low-income women's clinic and gave birth at an affiliated BFHI hospital. Using a medical anthropology analytical framework to examine predisposing, enabling, and service-related factors that affect breastfeeding, this study investigated interpersonal, sociocultural, and institutional barriers to breastfeeding. Common challenges experienced by participants included lack of maternity leave from work, lack of access to electric pumps, social pressures to initiate formula supplementation, fears that breastfeeding renders infants overly dependent on their mother's care, and a lack of breastfeeding role models and/or support networks to normalize longer-term breastfeeding. We conclude that efforts to increase breastfeeding rates for African American women and promote culturally sensitive interventions must address underlying socioeconomic and structural barriers, women's perceptions of breastfeeding benefits and difficulties, and the need for improvements in postnatal lactation and doula support to foster a more inclusive culture of breastfeeding.",The impact of the introduction of a point-of-care haematology analyser in a New Zealand rural hospital with no onsite laboratory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035770,Rural and remote health,2019 05 29,"Hokianga Hospital is a small rural hospital in the far north of New Zealand serving a predominantly Maori population of 6500.

The impact of the nanowire polarity on light emission is then investigated using cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy. EBSD can determine polarity of noncentrosymmetric crystals by interrogating differences in the intensity distribution of bands of the EBSD pattern associated with semipolar planes. Experimental EBSD patterns from an array of GaN nanowires are compared with theoretical patterns produced using dynamical electron simulations to reveal whether they are Ga- or N-polar or, as in several cases, of mixed polarity. CL spectroscopy demonstrates the effect of the polarity on light emission, with spectra obtained from nanowires of known polarity revealing a small but measurable shift (≈28 meV) in the GaN near band edge emission energy between those with Ga and N polarity. We attributed this energy shift to a difference in impurity incorporation in nanowires of different crystal polarity. This approach can be employed to nondestructively identify polarity in a wide range of noncentrosymmetric nanoscale material systems and provide direct comparison with their luminescence.",Characterization of a Nitrogen-Based Dielectric Barrier Discharge Ionization Source for Mass Spectrometry Reveals Factors Important for Soft Ionization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035763,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"Atmospheric pressure plasma-based ionization coupled to mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique. However, the characteristics of existing ionization sources, especially regarding the reactive species and the effect of the discharge type on the soft ionization, are often not well described. In this work, the active capillary plasma ionization source, which is based on a dielectric barrier discharge, was characterized by optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. To obtain a better understanding of the requirements for a soft ionization, several reactive species and the energy of the ionization reaction were identified. Charged reactive species such as H3O+, N2+•, N2H+, NO+, N3+, and N4+• as well as uncharged species (most probably the excited neutral nitrogen) were all found to contribute to the soft ionization process in dielectric barrier discharge. The energy in the plasma was determined to be in the range from 8 to 16 eV, based on the ionization energy of nitrogen and the measurements of tungsten hexacarbonyl. Furthermore, not only was the type of reactive species relevant for achieving a soft ionization, it was also crucial that the sample was injected through the inner electrode, which leads to nearly no direct contact with the discharge filaments.",High-Resolution Raman Microscopic Detection of Follicular Thyroid Cancer Cells with Unsupervised Machine Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035762,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 05 23,"We use Raman microscopic images with high spatial and spectral resolution to investigate differences between human follicular thyroid (Nthy-ori 3-1) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-133) cells, a well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Through comparison to classification of single-cell Raman spectra, the importance of subcellular information in the Raman images is emphasized. Subcellular information is extracted through a coarse-graining of the spectra at high spatial resolution (∼1.7 μm2), producing a set of characteristic spectral groups representing locations having similar biochemical compositions. We develop a cell classifier based on the frequencies at which the characteristic spectra appear within each of the single cells. Using this classifier, we obtain a more accurate (89.8%) distinction of FTC-133 and Nthy-ori 3-1, in comparison to single-cell spectra (77.6%). We also infer which subcellular components are important to cellular distinction; we find that cancerous FTC-133 cells contain increased populations of lipid-containing components and decreased populations of cytochrome-containing components relative to Nthy-ori 3-1, and that the regions containing these contributions are largely outside the cell nuclei. In addition to increased classification accuracy, this approach provides rich subcellular information about biochemical differences and cellular locations associated with the distinction of the normal and cancerous follicular thyroid cells.","Robustness, Entrainment, and Hybridization in Dissipative Molecular Networks, and the Origin of Life.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035761,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 08,"How simple chemical reactions self-assembled into complex, robust networks at the origin of life is unknown. This general problem-self-assembly of dissipative molecular networks-is also important in understanding the growth of complexity from simplicity in molecular and biomolecular systems. Here, we describe how heterogeneity in the composition of a small network of oscillatory organic reactions can sustain (rather than stop) these oscillations, when homogeneity in their composition does not. Specifically, multiple reactants in an amide-forming network sustain oscillation when the environment (here, the space velocity) changes, while homogeneous networks-those with fewer reactants-do not. Remarkably, a mixture of two reactants of different structure-neither of which produces oscillations individually-oscillates when combined. These results demonstrate that molecular heterogeneity present in mixtures of reactants can promote rather than suppress complex behaviors.",Design Principles for Thermoresponsive Core-Shell Nanoparticles: Controlling Thermal Transitions by Brush Morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035760,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 10,"In this feature article, we summarize our recent work on understanding and controlling the thermal behavior of nanoparticles grafted with thermoresponsive polymer shells. Precision synthesis of monodisperse superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals was combined with irreversible dense grafting of nitrodopamide-anchored thermoresponsive polymer chains. We provide an overview of how the dense and stable grafting of biomedically relevant polymers, including poly(ethylene glycol), poly( N-isopropylacrylamide), polysarcosin, and polyoxazolines, can be achieved. This platform has made it possible for us to demonstrate that the polymer brush geometry, as defined by the nanoparticle core and relative polymer brush size, determines the thermal transitions of the polymer brush. We furthermore summarize our work on how the polymer shell transitions and nanoparticle aggregation can be tuned. With the independent variation of the core and the shell, we can optimize and precisely control the thermally controlled solubility of our system. Finally, our feature article gives examples relevant to current and future applications. We show how the thermal response of the shell influences the nanoparticle performance in biological fluids and interactions with proteins and cells, also under purely magnetic actuation of the nanoparticles through the superparamagnetic iron oxide core.",An Automated Biomodel Selection System (BMSS) for Gene Circuit Designs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035759,ACS synthetic biology,2019 06 11,"Constructing a complex functional gene circuit composed of different modular biological parts to achieve the desired performance remains challenging without a proper understanding of how the individual module behaves. To address this, mathematical models serve as an important tool toward better interpretation by quantifying the performance of the overall gene circuit, providing insights, and guiding the experimental designs. As different gene circuits might require exclusively different mathematical representations in the form of ordinary differential equations to capture their transient dynamic behaviors, a recurring challenge in model development is the selection of the appropriate model. Here, we developed an automated biomodel selection system (BMSS) which includes a library of pre-established models with intuitive or unintuitive features derived from a vast array of expression profiles. Selection of models is built upon the Akaike information criteria (AIC). We tested the automated platform using characterization data of routinely used inducible systems, constitutive expression systems, and several different logic gate systems (NOT, AND, and OR gates). The BMSS achieved a good agreement for all the different characterization data sets and managed to select the most appropriate model accordingly. To enable exchange and reproducibility of gene circuit design models, the BMSS platform also generates Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)-compliant gene circuit diagrams and Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) output files. All aspects of the algorithm were programmed in a modular manner to ease the efforts on model extensions or customizations by users. Taken together, the BMSS which is implemented in Python supports users in deriving the best mathematical model candidate in a fast, efficient, and automated way using part/circuit characterization data.",Effect of Substrate and Bacterial Zeta Potential on Adhesion of Mycobacterium smegmatis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035758,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 28,"Bacterial adhesion is described as a multistep process of interactions between microbes and the substrate, beginning with reversible contact, followed by irreversible adhesion. We explore the influence of substrate zeta potential on adhesion of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a nonpathogenic bacterial model for tuberculosis-causing Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a common foulant of reverse osmosis filtration systems. Substrates having a range of zeta potentials were prepared by coating silica with the polycation, poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (pDADMAC), by adjusting the pH of alumina, a pH-responsive material, and by coating silica with a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer coating of octadecyltrichlorosilane. Our observations using these surfaces demonstrated that adhesion of M. smegmatis increased significantly by more than 200% on the silica-pDADMAC system and more than 300% on alumina substrates, as zeta potential became less negative, and that the variation of pH did not affect adhesion on alumina surfaces. Live and heat-killed bacteria were studied to investigate the contribution of biological response to adhesion with respect to zeta potential. While approximately 60% fewer heat-killed M. smegmatis adhered to pDADMAC-coated silica substrates, the trend of significantly increasing adhesion with less negative zeta potential was still observed. These results show the influence of zeta potential on adhesion of M. smegmatis, which is a separate process from that of the biological response. Across the range of substrate surface chemistries, hydrophobicities, and zeta potentials tested, adhesion of M. smegmatis can primarily be controlled by zeta potential. The bacterial zeta potential was not changed by the various experimental conditions and was -28.3 ± 2.4 mV.",Highly Sensitive and Selective Detection of Steroid Hormones Using Terahertz Molecule-Specific Sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035757,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"Discrimination and quantification of trace amounts of steroid hormones in biological specimens are needed to elucidate their changing expression because their biological functions are responsible for the development and prevention of endocrine disorders. Although mass-spectrometry-based assays are most commonly recommended, development of a new type of highly sensitive and selective detection methods in clinical practices is needed. Here, we introduce a label-free type of terahertz molecule sensor capable of sensing and identifying progesterone and 17α-OH-progesterone selectively. Nanoslot-array-based sensing chips were used as launching pads for absorption cross-section enhancement of molecules at a reliable terahertz frequency. With use of nanoslots with resonances at 1.17 THz corresponding to intrinsic THz absorption resonance mode for progesterone and at 1.51 THz for 17α-OH-progesterone, respectively, each steroid shows prominent transmittance change in terms of its amount. In particular, the sensing performance has been much improved by controlling evaporation speed, in turn resulting in an efficient, homogeneous distribution of the molecules onto a sensing hot spot."

As a result, various healthcare professionals now encounter ethical dilemmas that were formerly confined within the genetics clinic. In addition to autonomy and well-being of both patients and their family members, which need to be balanced carefully, a societal perspective is also vital to ensure the ethically sound introduction of whole genome sequencing into daily practice. Important choices to be made are: who is eligible for whole genome sequencing; how can informed consent be sensibly obtained, when dealing with such vast quantities of genomic information; which type of information should be offered to patients; should professionals actively search for pathogenic mutations. The rise of WGS has an impact on the moral responsibilities incumbent on healthcare professionals and necessitates a comprehensive societal debate on the advent of personalized medicine.",Serum S100A12 and S100B Proteins are Independent Predictors of the Presence and Severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035738,Turkish journal of medical sciences,2019 04 30,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with serious cardiometabolic risks.

A novel vibration-assisted thermal imprint method is proposed for effective formation of a microchannel network in the nanocomposite piezo polymer layer. In this method, bulk acoustic waves of different wavelengths excited in an imprinted microstructure enable it to function in trapping-patterning, valve, or free particle passing modes. Acoustic waves are excited using a special pattern of electrodes formed on its top surface and a single electric ground electrode formed on the bottom surface. To develop the microchannel, we first started with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanopowder [Pb (Zrx, Ti1-x) O3] synthesis. The PZT was further mixed with three different binding materials-polyvinyl butyral (PVB), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polystyrene (PS)-in benzyl alcohol to prepare a screen-printing paste. Then, using conventional screen printing techniques, three types of PZT coatings on copper foil substrates were obtained. To improve the voltage characteristics, the coatings were polarized. Their structural and chemical composition was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM), while the mechanical and electrical characteristics were determined using the COMSOL Multiphysics model with experimentally obtained parameters of periodic response of the layered copper foil structure. The hydrophobic properties of the PZT composite were analyzed by measuring the contact angle between the distilled water drop and the three different polymer composites: PZT with PVB, PZT with PMMA, and PZT with PS. Finally, the behavior of the microchannel formed in the nanocomposite piezo polymer was simulated by applying electrical excitation signal on the pattern of electrodes and then analyzed experimentally using holographic interferometry. Wave-shaped vibration forms of the microchannel were obtained, thereby enabling particle manipulation.",Adherence to a Mediterranean Dietary Pattern Is Associated with Higher Quality of Life in a Cohort of Italian Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035736,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"The observed rise in non-communicable diseases may be attributed to the ongoing changes of urban environment and society, as well as greater awareness of health-related issues and subsequent higher rates of diagnosis, which all contribute to the overall quality of life.

While exercise training (ET) improves diastolic function, its metabolic mechanisms in HFpEF are unclear. We assessed the metabolic response to 12 weeks of ET in patients with HFpEF by performing a post hoc analysis of the EX-DHF-P trial (ISRCTN86879094). Plasma concentrations of 188 endogenous metabolites were measured in 44 ET and 20 usual care (UC) patients at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Metabolic differences between ET and UC from baseline to follow-up were compared and differential responses to ET were examined by random forest feature selection. ET prevented the increase of acetylornithine and carnitine as well as the decrease of three glycerophospholipids. After ET, two opposite metabolic response clusters were identified. Cluster belonging was associated with perceived well-being at baseline and changes in low-density lipoprotein but not with cardiorespiratory, ventilatory or echocardiographic parameters. These two ET-induced metabolic response patterns illustrate the heterogeneity of the HFpEF patient population. Our results suggest that other biological parameters might be helpful besides clinical variables to improve HFpEF patient stratification. Whether this approach improves response prediction regarding ET and other treatments should be explored.",Signal Status Recognition Based on 1DCNN and Its Feature Extraction Mechanism Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035732,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this paper, we construct a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), which directly takes as the input the vibration signal in the mechanical operation process. It can realize intelligent mechanical fault diagnosis and ensure the authenticity of signal samples. Moreover, due to the excellent interpretability of the 1DCNN, we can explain the feature extraction mechanism of convolution and the synergistic work ability of the convolution kernel by analyzing convolution kernels and their output results in the time-domain, frequency-domain. What's more, we propose a novel network parameter-optimization method by matching the features of the convolution kernel with those of the original signal. A large number of experiments proved that, this optimization method improve the diagnostic accuracy and the operational efficiency greatly.",Virtual Sensors for Optimal Integration of Human Activity Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035731,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Sensors are becoming more and more ubiquitous as their price and availability continue to improve, and as they are the source of information for many important tasks. However, the use of sensors has to deal with noise and failures. The lack of reliability in the sensors has led to many forms of redundancy, but simple solutions are not always the best, and the precise way in which several sensors are combined has a big impact on the overall result. In this paper, we discuss how to deal with the combination of information coming from different sensors, acting thus as ""virtual sensors"", in the context of human activity recognition, in a systematic way, aiming for optimality. To achieve this goal, we construct meta-datasets containing the ""signatures"" of individual datasets, and apply machine-learning methods in order to distinguish when each possible combination method could be actually the best.

This parasite causes one of the most common parasitic infections in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmosis meets the requirements for a One Health Disease due to its ability to affect the health of human beings as well as domestic and free ranging animals. Integrating human, domestic animal, and wildlife data could better assess the risk and devise methods of control. A first step of such an approach would be the knowledge of the prevalence of parasitosis in humans and animals in selected areas. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of Toxoplasma infection in 216 free ranging birds belonging to different genera/species by serology and molecular techniques. Twenty-five out of 216 animals (11.6%) were positive to the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) with antibody titers ranging from 1/20 to 1/320, and 19 of them (8.8%) also showed a positive PCR for Toxoplasma DNA. The results confirmed the widespread occurrence of Toxoplasma infection in wild birds and serological data were corroborated by molecular results in birds that also had low antibody titers. The knowledge of the wide occurrence of the parasite in game and wild birds should enhance the accurate estimation of the risks in handling, managing, and eating these species with regard to domestic carnivores as well as the impact of viscera and offal in the environment.",The Effect of Innovation-Driven Strategy on Green Economic Development in China-An Empirical Study of Smart Cities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035729,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Of all the countries presently industrializing, both going green and going smart ideas can be likened to green development, in that they are helping to address or identify new routes out of environment and development conflicts. Environmental pollution issues loom large for China, and the scale of its transformation makes its proposed solutions of widespread interest. China has begun to decouple some environmental pressure from economic growth, and an innovation-driven strategy is proposed to deal with the synergic development between the economy and environment. Considering both positive and negative effects of the innovation-driven strategy on green economic development, the aim of this paper is to find out the influence path and mechanism of policies and measures of the innovation strategy on green economic development, through the empirical analysis of panel data of 47 pilot smart cities in China from 2009 to 2017.

To further investigate the effect of N on RABV, we manipulated an infectious cDNA clone of the RABV HEP-Flury to rearrange the N gene from its wild-type position of 1 (N-P-M-G-L) to 2 (P-N-M-G-L), 3 (P-M-N-G-L), or 4 (P-M-G-N-L), using an approach that left the viral nucleotide sequence unaltered. Subsequently, viable viruses were recovered from each of the rearranged cDNA and examined for their gene expression levels, growth kinetics in cell culture, pathogenicity in suckling mice and protection in mice. The results showed that gene rearrangement decreased N mRNA transcription and vRNA replication. As a result, all viruses with rearranged genomes showed worse replication than that of rHEP-Flury in NA cells at a MOI of 0.01, but equivalent or slightly better replication levels at a MOI of 3. Consequently, the lethality in suckling mice infected with N4 was clearly attenuated compared with rHEP-Flury. However, the protection to mice was not enhanced. This study not only gives us insight into the understanding of the phenotype of RABV N gene rearrangement, but also helps with rabies vaccine candidate construction."

While structures in non-coding regions have been investigated extensively, a thorough overview of the structural repertoire of protein coding mRNAs, especially for viruses, is lacking. Secondary structure prediction of large molecules, such as long mRNAs remains a challenging task, as the contingent of structures a sequence can theoretically fold into grows exponentially with sequence length. We applied a structure prediction pipeline to Viral Orthologous Groups that first identifies the local boundaries of potentially structured regions and subsequently predicts their functional importance. Using this procedure, the orthologous groups were split into structurally homogenous subgroups, which we call subVOGs. This is the first compilation of potentially functional conserved RNA structures in viral coding regions, covering the complete RefSeq viral database. We were able to recover structural elements from previous studies and discovered a variety of novel structured regions.

This results in neurite outgrowth inhibition and morphological changes in remaining long neurites in PC12 cells. Whether a specific molecular species of kCer can bind to the Sema3A receptor (Neuropilin1, Nrp1) and activate the Sema3A signaling pathway remains unknown. Here, we prepared kCer molecular species using endoglycoceramidase I-mediated deglucosylation and examined neurite outgrowth and phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 in nerve growth factor (NGF)-primed cells. The 8-trans unsaturation of sphingadienine of kCer was essential for Sema3A-like signaling pathway activation. Conversely, 8-cis unsaturation of kCer molecular species had no effect on Sema3A-like activation, and neurite outgrowth inhibition resulted in remaining short neurites. In addition, α-hydroxylation of fatty acids was not associated with the Sema3A-like activity of the kCer molecular species. These results suggest that 8-trans or 8-cis isomerization of sphingadienine determines the specific interactions at the ligand-binding site of Nrp1.",Deforestation Increases the Risk of Scrub Typhus in Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035715,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Background: Scrub typhus is an important public health issue in Korea. Risk factors for scrub typhus include both individual-level factors and environmental drivers, and some are related to the increased density of vector mites and rodents, the natural hosts of the mites. In this regard, deforestation is a potential risk factor, because the deforestation-induced secondary growth of scrub vegetation may increase the densities of mites and rodents. To examine this hypothesis, this study investigated the association between scrub typhus and deforestation. Methods: We acquired district-level data for 2006-2017, including the number of cases of scrub typhus reported annually, deforestation level, and other covariates. Deforestation was assessed using preprocessed remote-sensing satellite data. Bayesian regression models, including Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial models, were examined, and spatial autocorrelation was considered in hierarchical models. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using different accumulation periods for the deforestation level to examine the robustness of the association. Results: The final models showed a significant association between deforestation and the incidence of scrub typhus (relative risk = 1.20, 95% credible interval = 1.15-1.24). The sensitivity analysis gave consistent results, and a potential long-term effect of deforestation for up to 5 years was shown. Conclusion: The results support the potential public health benefits of forest conservation by suppressing the risk of scrub typhus, implying the need for strong engagement of public health sectors in conservation issues from a One Health perspective.","Routine Herd Health Data as Cow-Based Risk Factors Associated with Lameness in Pasture-Based, Spring Calving Irish Dairy Cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035714,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 30,"Herd-level risk factors related to the cow's environment have been associated with lameness. Uncomfortable stall surface and inadequate depth of bedding as well as abrasive alley way surface are contributing factors to increased levels of lameness. Access to pasture has been found as having a beneficial effect on cows' locomotion. However, dairy cattle managed under grazing conditions are exposed to a different set of risk factors for lameness, mainly associated with cow tracks. Cow-based risk factors for lameness are not as clearly defined as the herd level risk factors. The objective of the present study was to use routine herd health monitoring data to identify cow-based risk factors for lameness and utilise this information to indicate cows at risk of developing lameness in the first 150 days of lactation. Lameness data were gathered from 10 pasture-based dairy herds. A total of 1715 cows were monitored, of which 1675 cows were available for analysis. Associations between lameness status and potential cow-level risk factors were determined using multivariable logistic regression. Parity 3 and 4 + cows showed odd ratios (OR's) for lameness of 3.92 and 8.60 respectively (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.46-6.24; 5.68-13.0). Maximum loss of Body condition score (BCS) after calving exhibits OR's for lameness of 1.49 (95% CI 1.08-2.04) if cows lost 0.5 in BCS after calving and 2.26 (95% CI 1.30-3.95) for cows losing more than 0.5 BCS. Animals calving in BCS 3.25 and ≥ 3.5 had correlating OR's of 0.54 (95% CI 0.34-0.87) and 0.33 (95% CI 0.16-0.65) for being lame compared to cows calving with BCS ≤ 2.75. Data gathered as part of herd health monitoring can be used in conjunction with lameness records to identify shortcomings in lameness management.

The behavioral manifestations of ASD may be a consequence of genetic and/or environmental pathology in neurodevelopmental processes. In this limited study, we assayed autoantibodies to a panel of vital neuronal and glial proteins in the sera of 40 subjects (10 children with ASD and their mothers along with 10 healthy controls, age-matched children and their mothers). Serum samples were screened using Western Blot analysis to measure immunoglobulin (IgG) reactivity against a panel of 9 neuronal proteins commonly associated with neuronal degeneration: neurofilament triplet proteins (NFP), tubulin, microtubule-associated proteins (tau), microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), α-synuclein (SNCA) and astrocytes proteins such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B protein. Our data show that the levels of circulating IgG class autoantibodies against the nine proteins were significantly elevated in ASD children. Mothers of ASD children exhibited increased levels of autoantibodies against all panel of tested proteins except for S100B and tubulin compared to age-matched healthy control children and their mothers. Control children and their mothers showed low and insignificant levels of autoantibodies to neuronal and glial proteins. These results strongly support the importance of anti-neuronal and glial protein autoantibodies biomarker in screening for ASD children and further confirm the importance of the involvement of the maternal immune system as an index that should be considered in fetal in utero environmental exposures. More studies are needed using larger cohort to verify these results and understand the importance of the presence of such autoantibodies in children with autism and their mothers, both as biomarkers and their role in the mechanism of action of autism and perhaps in its treatment.","Toxicity and Toxin Composition of the Greater Blue-Ringed Octopus Hapalochlaena lunulata from Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035711,Toxins,2019 04 30,"The toxicity of the greater blue-ringed octopus Hapalochlaenalunulata, whose bite is fatal to humans, was examined to better understand and prevent deaths from accidental bites. Living specimens were collected from tide pools on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, in November and December of 2015, 2016, and 2017. The specimens were examined for the anatomical distribution of the toxicity, which was expressed in terms of mouse units (MU), by the standard bioassay method for tetrodotoxin (TTX) in Japan. Paralytic toxicity to mice was detected in all of the soft parts. The posterior salivary glands exhibited the highest toxicity score with a maximum level of 9276 MU/g, which was classified as ""strongly toxic"" (more than 1000 MU/g tissue) according to the classification of toxicity established by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan, followed by the hepatopancreas (21.1 to 734.3 MU/g), gonads (not detectable to 167.6 MU/g), arms (5.3 to 130.2 MU/g), and other body areas (17.3 to 107.4 MU/g). Next, the toxin from the salivary glands was partially purified by a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter with a 3000-Da cut-off, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) equipped with a φ2.0 × 150-mm (5 μm) TSKgel Amide-80 column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) with a mixture of 16 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 5.5) and acetonitrile (ratio 3:7, v/v) as a mobile phase. This study aimed to clarify the toxicity and the composition of TTX and its derivatives in this toxic octopus. The main toxin in this toxic octopus was identified as TTX, along with 4-epi TTX, 4, 9-anhydroTTX and 6-epi TTX. Further, the toxicity of this species is also significant from a food hygiene point of view.",Effects of a Single Ingestion of Trehalose during Prolonged Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035710,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Trehalose (TRE), a disaccharide, is absorbed slowly and gradually increases the blood glucose (GLU) level along with reducing insulin secretion.

We examined exercise performance using the Wingate test, with 30-min constant load exercise at 40% VO2peak after exercising for 60 min at 40% VO2peak, by using an electromagnetic brake-type bicycle ergometer (Part 1). The power values, blood glucose and lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were measured. In addition, we investigated the energy metabolism after a single ingestion of TRE, by measuring the RER and estimating the lipid oxidation for 60 min at 40% VO2peak (Part 2). Healthy college male students performed three trials-(1) placebo (WAT), (2) GLU, and (3) TRE. Repeated two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for a comparison of the data among the three trial groups. A multiple comparison test was performed using post hoc Bonferroni correction. The TRE ingestion significantly increased the average and maximum power values (p < 0.01).

However, the exponentially expanding LTE femtocells cause interference in the network, as they share the same licensed spectrum with a macrocell. To tackle this issue, numerous interference mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we proposed an Active Power Control (APC) technique, which not only reduces Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) in a Macro User Equipment (MUE), generated from the downlink transmission power of an inadequately deployed femtocell, but also reduces unnecessary power consumption to achieve a green femtocell network. The simulation results show that the proposed APC technique effectively reduces ICI and optimizes the throughput performance of the MUE. Compared with the existing power control techniques, the APC technique provides a balanced trade-off in attaining necessary Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the Femto User Equipment (FUE) and reducing ICI to the victim MUE existing in the close proximity of the femtocell.",Adaptive Selection of Truncation Radius in Calderon's Method for Direct Image Reconstruction in Electrical Capacitance Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035706,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Calderon's method has been successfully used for the direct image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography.

Then, a strategy for adaptive selection of the truncation radius was proposed. The amplitude information of the elements in the scattering transform matrix computed from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map was used to determine the range for the truncation radius selection, and the phase information was further used to select a proper truncation radius value within this selection range. Finally, experiments were carried out to verify the strategy. Experimental results showed that small relative image error and good visual effect could be obtained by using the truncation radius selected by the proposed strategy.",A Preliminary Metagenome Analysis Based on a Combination of Protein Domains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035705,Proteomes,2019 04 30,"Metagenomic data have mainly been addressed by showing the composition of organisms based on a small part of a well-examined genomic sequence, such as ribosomal RNA genes and mitochondrial DNAs. On the contrary, whole metagenomic data obtained by the shotgun sequence method have not often been fully analyzed through a homology search because the genomic data in databases for living organisms on earth are insufficient. In order to complement the results obtained through homology-search-based methods with shotgun metagenomes data, we focused on the composition of protein domains deduced from the sequences of genomes and metagenomes, and we utilized them in characterizing genomes and metagenomes, respectively. First, we compared the relationships based on similarities in the protein domain composition with the relationships based on sequence similarities. We searched for protein domains of 325 bacterial species produced using the Pfam database. Next, the correlation coefficients of protein domain compositions between every pair of bacteria were examined. Every pairwise genetic distance was also calculated from 16S rRNA or DNA gyrase subunit B. We compared the results of these methods and found a moderate correlation between them. Essentially, the same results were obtained when we used partial random 100 bp DNA sequences of the bacterial genomes, which simulated raw sequence data obtained from short-read next-generation sequences. Then, we applied the method for analyzing the actual environmental data obtained by shotgun sequencing. We found that the transition of the microbial phase occurred because the seasonal change in water temperature was shown by the method. These results showed the usability of the method in characterizing metagenomic data based on protein domain compositions."

Recent innovations in molecular and genetic technology enable us to compare conventional histological classifications, protein expression status, and gene abnormalities. The introduction of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project along with the widespread use of the next-generation sequencer (NGS) have facilitated access to enormous data regarding the molecular profiles of lung cancer. The World Health Organization classification of lung cancer, which was revised in 2015, is based on this progress in molecular pathology; moreover, immunohistochemistry has come to play a larger role in diagnosis. In this article, we focused on genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in non-small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), neuroendocrine tumor (including carcinoids, small cell carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma), and carcinoma with rare histological subtypes.

Methods A total of 554 residents completed a structured questionnaire on quality of life, physical activity level and healthy eating practice. Particularly, categories of physical activity and durations were obtained by using the short form Chinese International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-C), then the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)-minutes/week was calculated using the formulae (walking minutes × walking days × 3.3) + (moderate-intensity activity minutes × moderate days × 4.0) + (vigorous-intensity activity minutes × vigorous-intensity days × 8.0). The percentage of green space was calculated based on a spatial buffer with a 500 m radius from participants' geocoded addresses using a SPOT ('Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre' in French) satellite image-derived vegetation dataset. Parks, promenade and sports facilities were examples of open spaces. Results The sampled population who lived with green space averaged 10.11% ± 7.95% (ranged 1.56-32.90%), with the majority (90%) performing physical activities at medium and high levels. MET-minutes/week was significantly associated (Pearson r = 0.092; p < 0.05) with the green space percentage. Relatively active residents commonly used open spaces within the district for performing exercise, in particular, parks and promenades were mostly used by older residents, while sports facilities by the younger groups at age 25-44 and <25 years. Conclusions Current findings suggested promotion of exercise could be achieved by the design or redesign of built environment to include more parks accessible to the residents with the increase of vegetation.",Identification of FDA-Approved Drugs with Activity against Stationary Phase Bartonella henselae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035691,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Bartonella henselae can cause various infections in humans, ranging from benign and self-limiting diseases to severe and life-threatening diseases as well as persistent infections that are difficult to treat. To develop more effective treatments for persistent Bartonella infections, in this study, we performed a high-throughput screen of an FDA-approved drug library against stationary phase B. henselae using the SYBR Green I/propidium iodide (PI) viability assay. We identified 110 drug candidates that had better activity against stationary phase B. henselae than ciprofloxacin, and among the top 52 drug candidates tested, 41 drugs were confirmed by microscopy to have higher activity than the current frontline antibiotic erythromycin. The identified top drug candidates include pyrvinium pamoate, daptomycin, methylene blue, azole drugs (clotrimazole, miconazole, sulconazole, econazole, oxiconazole, butoconazole, bifonazole), aminoglycosides (gentamicin and streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin), amifostine (Ethyol), antiviral Lopinavir/ritonavir, colistin, nitroxoline, nitrofurantoin, verteporfin, pentamidine, berberine, aprepitant, olsalazine, clinafloxacin, and clofoctol. Pyrvinium pamoate, daptomycin, methylene blue, clotrimazole, and gentamicin and streptomycin at their respective maximum drug concentration in serum (Cmax) had the capacity to completely eradicate stationary phase B. henselae after 3-day drug exposure in subculture studies. While the currently used drugs for treating bartonellosis, including rifampin, erythromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin, had very low minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against growing B. henselae, they had relatively poor activity against stationary phase B. henselae, except aminoglycosides. The identified FDA-approved agents with activity against stationary phase B. henselae should facilitate development of more effective treatments for persistent Bartonella infections.",A Lightweight Three-Factor Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme in Wireless Sensor Networks for Smart Homes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035690,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) is used for a smart home system's backbone that monitors home environment and controls smart home devices to manage lighting, heating, security and surveillance. However, despite its convenience and potential benefits, there are concerns about various security threats that may infringe on privacy and threaten our home life. For protecting WSNs for smart homes from those threats, authentication and key agreement are basic security requirements. There have been a large number of proposed authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs. In 2017, Jung et al. proposed an efficient and security enhanced anonymous authentication with key agreement scheme by employing biometrics information as the third authentication factor. They claimed that their scheme resists on various security attacks and satisfies basic security requirements. However, we have discovered that Jung et al.'s scheme possesses some security weaknesses. Their scheme cannot guarantee security of the secret key of gateway node and security of session key and protection against user tracking attack, information leakage attack, and user impersonation attack. In this paper, we describe how those security weaknesses occur and propose a lightweight three-factor authentication and key agreement scheme in WSNs for smart homes, as an improved version of Jung et al.'s scheme. We then present a detailed analysis of the security and performance of the proposed scheme and compare the analysis results with other related schemes.",Filling the Gap: Neural Stem Cells as A Promising Therapy for Spinal Cord Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035689,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to severe motor, sensory and social impairments having a huge impact on patients' lives. The complex and time-dependent SCI pathophysiology has been hampering the development of novel and effective therapies. Current treatment options include surgical interventions, to stabilize and decompress the spinal cord, and rehabilitative care, without providing a cure for these patients. Novel therapies have been developed targeting different stages during trauma. Among them, cell-based therapies hold great potential for tissue regeneration after injury. Neural stem cells (NSCs), which are multipotent cells with inherent differentiation capabilities committed to the neuronal lineage, are especially relevant to promote and reestablish the damaged neuronal spinal tracts. Several studies demonstrate the regenerative effects of NSCs in SCI after transplantation by providing neurotrophic support and restoring synaptic connectivity. Therefore, human clinical trials have already been launched to assess safety in SCI patients. Here, we review NSC-based experimental studies in a SCI context and how are they currently being translated into human clinical trials.",The Rise of Elite Short-Course Triathlon Re-Emphasises the Necessity to Transition Efficiently from Cycling to Running.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035687,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Transitioning efficiently between cycling and running is considered an indication of overall performance, and as a result the cycle-run (C-R) transition is one of the most researched areas of triathlon. Previous studies have thoroughly investigated the impact of prior cycling on running performance. However, with the increasing number of short-course events and the inclusion of the mixed relay at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, efficiently transitioning from cycle-run has been re-emphasised and with it, any potential limitations to running performance among elite triathletes. This short communication provides coaches and sports scientists a review of the literature detailing the negative effects of prior variable-cycling on running performance experienced among elite, short-course and Olympic distance triathletes; as well as discussing practical methods to minimise any negative impact of cycling on running performance. The current literature suggests that variable-cycling negatively effects running ability in at least some elite triathletes and that improving swimming performance, drafting during cycling and C-R training at race intensity could improve an athlete's triathlon running performance. It is recommended that future research clearly define the performance level, competitive format of the experimental population and use protocols that are specific to the experimental population in order to improve the training and practical application of the research findings.",The Impact of a Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitor (L-NAME) on Ischemia⁻Reperfusion Injury of Cholestatic Livers by Pringle Maneuver and Liver Resection after Bile Duct Ligation in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035686,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The Pringle maneuver (PM) has been widely used to control blood loss during liver resection. However, hepatic inflow occlusion can also result in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), especially in patients with a cholestatic, fibrotic, or cirrhotic liver. Here we investigate a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on IRI after the PM and partial hepatectomy of cholestatic livers induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in rats. Control group (non-BDL/no treatment), BDL + T group (BDL/L-NAME treatment) and BDL group (BDL/no treatment) were analyzed. Cholestasis was induced by BDL in the L-NAME and BDL group and a 50% partial hepatectomy with PM was performed. L-NAME was injected before PM in the BDL + T group. Hepatocellular damage, portal venous flow, microcirculation, endothelial lining, and eNOS, iNOS, interleukin (IL)-6, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were evaluated. Microcirculation of the liver in the BDL + T group tended to be higher. Liver damage and apoptotic index were significantly lower and Ki-67 labeling index was higher in the BDL + T group while iNOS and TGF-β expression was decreased. This was corroborated by a better preserved endothelial lining. L-NAME attenuated IRI following PM and improved proliferation/regeneration of cholestatic livers. These positive effects were considered as the result of improved hepatic microcirculation, prevention of iNOS formation, and TGF-β mRNA upregulation.",In-Situ Measurements in Microscale Gas Flows-Conventional Sensors or Something Else?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035685,Micromachines,2019 04 30,"Within the last few decades miniaturization has a driving force in almost all areas of technology, leading to a tremendous intensification of systems and processes. Information technology provides now data density several orders of magnitude higher than a few years ago, and the smartphone technology includes, as well the simple ability to communicate with others, features like internet, video and music streaming, but also implementation of the global positioning system, environment sensors or measurement systems for individual health. So-called wearables are everywhere, from the physio-parameter sensing wrist smart watch up to the measurement of heart rates by underwear. This trend holds also for gas flow applications, where complex flow arrangements and measurement systems formerly designed for a macro scale have been transferred into miniaturized versions. Thus, those systems took advantage of the increased surface to volume ratio as well as of the improved heat and mass transfer behavior of miniaturized equipment. In accordance, disadvantages like gas flow mal-distribution on parallelized mini- or micro tubes or channels as well as increased pressure losses due to the minimized hydraulic diameters and an increased roughness-to-dimension ratio have to be taken into account. Furthermore, major problems are arising for measurement and control to be implemented for in-situ and/or in-operando measurements. Currently, correlated measurements are widely discussed to obtain a more comprehensive view to a process by using a broad variety of measurement techniques complementing each other. Techniques for correlated measurements may include commonly used techniques like thermocouples or pressure sensors as well as more complex systems like gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, infrared or ultraviolet spectroscopy and many others. Some of these techniques can be miniaturized, some of them cannot yet. Those should, nevertheless, be able to conduct measurements at the same location and the same time, preferably in-situ and in-operando. Therefore, combinations of measurement instruments might be necessary, which will provide complementary techniques for accessing local process information. A recently more intensively discussed additional possibility is the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems, which might be useful in combination with other, more conventional measurement techniques. NMR is currently undergoing a tremendous change from large-scale to benchtop measurement systems, and it will most likely be further miniaturized. NMR allows a multitude of different measurements, which are normally covered by several instruments. Additionally, NMR can be combined very well with other measurement equipment to perform correlative in-situ and in-operando measurements. Such combinations of several instruments would allow us to retrieve an ""information cloud"" of a process. This paper will present a view of some common measurement techniques and the difficulties of applying them on one hand in a miniaturized scale, and on the other hand in a correlative mode. Basic suggestions to achieve the above-mentioned objective by a combination of different methods including NMR will be given.",The Possible Role of the Microbiota-Gut-Brain-Axis in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035684,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"New research points to a possible link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the gut microbiota as many autistic children have co-occurring gastrointestinal problems. This review focuses on specific alterations of gut microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or leaky gut in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative gut-blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and gut microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of bacterial-derived compounds as new possible biomarkers, associated with perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism, as well as potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed.",Ground Reaction Forces and Kinematics of Ski Jump Landing Using Wearable Sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035683,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In the past, technological issues limited research focused on ski jump landing. Today, thanks to the development of wearable sensors, it is possible to analyze the biomechanics of athletes without interfering with their movements. The aims of this study were twofold. Firstly, the quantification of the kinetic magnitude during landing is performed using wireless force insoles while 22 athletes jumped during summer training on the hill. In the second part, the insoles were combined with inertial motion units (IMUs) to determine the possible correlation between kinematics and kinetics during landing. The maximal normal ground reaction force (GRFmax) ranged between 1.1 and 5.3 body weight per foot independently when landing using the telemark or parallel leg technique. The GRFmax and impulse were correlated with flying time (p < 0.001). The hip flexions/extensions and the knee and hip rotations of the telemark front leg correlated with GRFmax (r = 0.689, p = 0.040; r = -0.670, p = 0.048; r = 0.820, p = 0.007; respectively). The force insoles and their combination with IMUs resulted in promising setups to analyze landing biomechanics and to provide in-field feedback to the athletes, being quick to place and light, without limiting movement."

This discrepancy can be due to the sensor noise, deformation of the sensor mount, and other factors. These mismatched coordinates can seriously affect the estimation of a distant object's position and this error can result in problems with object identification. To overcome these problems, numerous coordinate correction methods have been studied to minimize coordinate mismatching, such as off-line sensor error modeling and real-time error estimation methods. The first approach, off-line sensor error modeling, cannot cope with the occurrence of a mismatched coordinate in real-time. The second approach, using real-time error estimation methods, has high computational complexity due to the singular value decomposition. Therefore, we present a fast online coordinate correction method based on a reduced sensor position error model with dominant parameters and estimate the parameters by using rapid math operations. By applying the fast coordinate correction method, we can reduce the computational effort within the necessary tolerance of the estimation error. By experiments, the computational effort was improved by up to 99.7% compared to the previous study, and regarding the object's radar the identification problems were improved by 94.8%. We conclude that the proposed method provides sufficient correcting performance for autonomous driving applications when the multi-sensor coordinates are mismatched.",Facile Approach to Develop Hierarchical Roughness fiber@SiO2 Blocks for Superhydrophobic Paper.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035671,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Papers with nanoscaled surface roughness and hydrophobically modification have been widely used in daily life.

This research aims to fabricate superhydrophobic papers with low cost and nontoxic materials. The surface of cellulose fibers was initially coated with a film of SiO2 nanoparticles via sol-gel process. After papermaking and subsequent modification with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane through a simple solution-immersion process, the paper showed excellent superhydrophobic properties, with water contact angles (WCA) larger than 150°. Moreover, the prepared paper also showed superior mechanical durability against 10 times of deformation.

For the radar satellite recognition task, orbital altitude is introduced as a distinct and accessible feature to divide radar data. On this basis, we design a new distance metric for HRRPs called normalized angular distance divided by correlation coefficient (NADDCC), and a hierarchical clustering method based on this distance metric is applied to segment the radar observation angular domain. Using the above technology, the radar data partition is completed and multiple HRRP data clusters are obtained. To further mine the essential features in HRRPs, a GRU-SVM model is designed and firstly applied for radar HRRP target recognition. It consists of a multi-layer GRU neural network as a deep feature extractor and linear SVM as a classifier. By training, GRU neural network successfully extracts effective and highly distinguishable features of HRRPs, and feature visualization technology shows its advantages. Furthermore, the performance testing and comparison experiments also demonstrate that GRU neural network possesses better comprehensive performance for HRRP target recognition than LSTM neural network and conventional RNN, and the recognition performance of our method is almost better than that of other several common feature extraction methods or no data partition.",Choosing from an Optimal Number of Options Makes Curry and Tea More Palatable.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035669,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Previous studies have shown that affording people choice increases their satisfaction with subsequent experiences: the choice effect. However, it remains unclear whether the choice effect occurs in the hedonic response to foods and beverages. Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the choice effect on the palatability perception. Ready-to-serve curries and tea were presented as options in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, respectively. Experiment 1 failed to demonstrate significant differences among palatability ratings for a curry chosen by participants and for a curry chosen by the experimenter. However, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants perceived a tea chosen by themselves as more palatable than another tea chosen by the experimenter, regardless of the fact that the two cups of tea were identical. Intriguingly, the effect was obtained only when the number of options was neither too small nor too big. These results indicate that the exercise of choice from an optimal number of options, even when the choice is ostensible and illusory, makes people perceive their chosen foods and beverages as being more palatable. Some implications for the domain of food business are also discussed.","Ouabain Enhances Cell-Cell Adhesion Mediated by β1 Subunits of the Na+,K+-ATPase in CHO Fibroblasts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035668,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Adhesion is a crucial characteristic of epithelial cells to form barriers to pathogens and toxic substances from the environment. Epithelial cells attach to each other using intercellular junctions on the lateral membrane, including tight and adherent junctions, as well as the Na+,K+-ATPase. Our group has shown that non-adherent chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the canine β1 subunit become adhesive, and those homotypic interactions amongst β1 subunits of the Na+,K+-ATPase occur between neighboring epithelial cells. Ouabain, a cardiotonic steroid, binds to the α subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase, inhibits the pump activity and induces the detachment of epithelial cells when used at concentrations above 300 nM. At nanomolar non-inhibiting concentrations, ouabain affects the adhesive properties of epithelial cells by inducing the expression of cell adhesion molecules through the activation of signaling pathways associated with the α subunit. In this study, we investigated whether the adhesion between β1 subunits was also affected by ouabain. We used CHO fibroblasts stably expressing the β1 subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase (CHO β1), and studied the effect of ouabain on cell adhesion. Aggregation assays showed that ouabain increased the adhesion between CHO β1 cells. Immunofluorescence and biotinylation assays showed that ouabain (50 nM) increases the expression of the β1 subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase at the cell membrane. We also examined the effect of ouabain on the activation of signaling pathways in CHO β1 cells, and their subsequent effect on cell adhesion. We found that cSrc is activated by ouabain and, therefore, that it likely regulates the adhesive properties of CHO β1 cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that the β1 subunit adhesion is modulated by the expression levels of the Na+,K+-ATPase at the plasma membrane, which is regulated by ouabain.",An Advanced Algorithm for Higher Network Navigation in Social Internet of Things Using Small-World Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035667,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a recent evolutionary technology that has been the primary focus of researchers for the last two decades. In the IoT, an enormous number of objects are connected together using diverse communications protocols. As a result of this massive object connectivity, a search for the exact service from an object is difficult, and hence the issue of scalability arises. In order to resolve this issue, the idea of integrating the social networking concept into the IoT, generally referred as the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) was introduced. The SIoT is gaining popularity and attracting the attention of the research community due to its flexible and spacious nature. In the SIoT, objects have the ability to find a desired service in a distributed manner by using their neighbors. Although the SIoT technique has been proven to be efficient, heterogeneous devices are growing so exponentially that problems can exist in the search for the right object or service from a huge number of devices. In order to better analyze the performance of services in an SIoT domain, there is a need to impose a certain set of rules on these objects. Our novel contribution in this study is to address the link selection problem in the SIoT by proposing an algorithm that follows the key properties of navigability in small-world networks, such as clustering coefficients, path lengths, and giant components. Our algorithm empowers object navigability in the SIoT by restricting the number of connections for objects, eliminating old links or having fewer connections. We performed an extensive series of experiments by using real network data sets from social networking sites like Brightkite and Facebook. The expected results demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient, especially in terms of reducing path length and increasing the average clustering coefficient. Finally, it reflects overall results in terms of achieving easier network navigation. Our algorithm can easily be applied to a single node or even an entire network.",Parallel Transmission of Distributed Sensor Based on SCTP and TCP for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks in IoT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035666,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT) generate large amounts of data, which requires high-speed data transmission. In order to achieve the parallel transmissions of the wireless sensor network on the transmission layer, the performance of stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) and transmission control protocol (TCP) in the wireless sensor network under different packet error rates was simulated and compared. A dynamic multipath handover method for SCTP (MS-SCTP) was proposed to improve the transmission performance, which selects the transmission path according to the packet error rate and the retransmission ratio in the sender's buffer. The TCP and SCTP protocol switching method (TCP-SCTP) was proposed to detect the current network traffic and adjust the MS-SCTP or TCP method. Analysis and simulation results show that MS-SCTP and TCP-SCTP could improve network throughput and reduce packet loss rate.

Our prior precision LAP-ST (pLAP-ST) performing titrating in the current domain has provided initial proof of concept data in humans of its advantage in terms of reduction of cognitive side effects. The aims of this report are to: 1) compare LAP-ST (at 500mA) versus standard Right Unilateral (RUL) ECT (at 900 mA) in terms of magnitude of remission of suicidality in a randomized allocation and 2) compare the speed of remission of suicidality between LAP-ST versus RUL ECT. Methods: Patients were randomized to either LAP-ST or RUL ECT. The scores pertaining to the suicidal ideation (SI) item on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were analyzed using descriptive analysis and no confirmatory statistical analysis was performed due to a priori sample size limitations for this pilot study. SI item remission was defined as 2 or below on this item. Results: Eleven patients with major depressive episode (MDE) of mainly unipolar or bipolar disorders signed consent. Of these, 7 were eligible and were randomized and included in the analysis; all were actively suicidal at baseline (suicide item above 2), except 1 patient who had suicide item at 2 in the RUL ECT group. Suicidality remitted on average by session 3 and remission occurred for all patients by session 4. The SI mean score improvement from baseline to endpoint for LAP-ST was 5.1 and for RUL ECT was 3.0. Conclusions: LAP-ST has larger effect size and speed of remission of suicidality compared to standard RUL ECT. Future studies are warranted for replicating these findings.

A modified Delphi process was used to evaluate variables identified from published literature that could be used to support an assessment of appropriateness of antibiotic use. At a national workshop, 22 infection experts reached a consensus to define appropriate prescribing and agree upon an initial draft audit tool. Following this, a national multidisciplinary panel of 19 infection experts, of whom only one was part of the workshop, was convened to evaluate and validate variables using questionnaires to confirm the relevance of each variable in assessing appropriate prescribing. The initial evidence synthesis of published literature identified 25 variables that could be used to support an assessment of appropriateness of antibiotic use. All the panel members reviewed the variables for the first round of the Delphi; the panel accepted 23 out of 25 variables. Following review by the project team, one of the two rejected variables was rephrased, and the second neutral variable was re-scored. The panel accepted both these variables in round two with a 68% response rate. Accepted variables were used to develop an audit tool to determine the extent of appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing at the individual patient level in acute NHS hospitals through infection expert consensus based on the results of a Delphi process."

Despite substantial progress in its prevention and treatment, mortality rates remain high. Device therapy for HF mainly includes cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Recently, however, a new device therapy-cardiac contractility modulation (CCM)-became available. (2) Aim: The purpose of this study is to present a first case-series of patients with different clinical patterns of HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), supported with the newest generation of CCM devices. (3) Methods and results: Five patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% and a New York Heart Association (NYHA) class ≥ III were supported with CCM OPTIMIZER® SMART IPGCCMX10 at our clinic. The patients had a median age of 67 ± 8.03 years (47-80) and were all males-four with ischemic etiology dilated cardiomyopathy. In two cases, CCM was added on top of CRT (non-responders), and, in one patient, CCM was delivered during persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). After 6 months of follow-up, the LVEF increased from 25.4 ± 6.8% to 27 ± 9%, and the six-minute walk distance increased from 310 ± 65.1 m to 466 ± 23.6 m. One patient died 47 days after device implantation.

X-ray diffraction results revealed that the galleries of MMT were expanded significantly after intercalation of different loading of PEO. MMT/PEO 80/20 composite was chosen as the support platform for immobilization of Pd species in preparing novel heterogeneous catalysts. After immobilization of Pd species, the interlayer spacing of MMT/PEO (80/20) (1.52 nm) was further increased to 1.72 nm (Pd2+@MMT/PEO) and 1.73 nm (Pd0@MMT/PEO), confirming the well-immobilization of the Pd species in the interlayer spaces of PEO-modified MMT. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) observation results confirmed that Pd nanoparticles were confined inside the interlayer space of MMT and/or dispersed well on the outer surface of MMT. The conversion of Pd2+ to Pd0 species was evidenced by binding energy characterization with X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS). The microstructure variation caused by the Pd immobilization was sensitively detected by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) studies. The prepared Pd0@MMT/PEO (0.2/80/20) catalytic composite exhibits good thermal stability up to around 200 °C, and it showed high activities for Heck reactions between aryl iodides and butyl acrylates and could be recycled for five times. The correlations between the microstructure and properties of the Pd@MMT/PEO catalytic composites were discussed.","""Intrinsic"" Anion Exchange Polymers through the Dissociation of Strong Basic Groups: PPO with Grafted Bicyclic Guanidines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035646,Membranes,2019 04 30,"We synthesized anion exchange polymers by a reaction of chloromethylated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene)oxide (PPO) with strongly basic 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD). TBD contains secondary and tertiary amine groups in the guanidine portion. To favor the functionalization with the secondary amine, TBD was activated with butyl lithium. The yield of amine formation via the reaction of the benzyl chloride moiety with TBD was 85%. Furthermore, we prepared polymers with quaternary ammonium groups by the reaction of PPO-TBD with CH3I. The synthesis pathways and ionomer structure were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The thermal decomposition of both ionomers, studied by thermogravimetry, started above 200 °C, corresponding to the loss of the basic group. The ion exchange capacities, water uptake and volumetric swelling are also reported. The ""intrinsic"" anion conductivity of PPO-TBD due to the dissociation of grafted TBD was in the order of 1 mS/cm (Cl form). The quaternized ionomer (PPO-TBD-Me) showed an even larger ionic conductivity, above 10 mS/cm at 80 °C in fully humidified conditions.",UMP Kinase Regulates Chloroplast Development and Cold Response in Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035645,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Pyrimidine nucleotides are important metabolites that are building blocks of nucleic acids, which participate in various aspects of plant development. Only a few genes involved in pyrimidine metabolism have been identified in rice and the majority of their functions remain unclear. In this study, we used a map-based cloning strategy to isolate a UMPK gene in rice, encoding the UMP kinase that phosphorylates UMP to form UDP, from a recessive mutant with pale-green leaves. In the mutant, UDP content always decreased, while UTP content fluctuated with the development of leaves. Mutation of UMPK reduced chlorophyll contents and decreased photosynthetic capacity. In the mutant, transcription of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent genes, including psaA, psbB, psbC and petB, was significantly reduced, whereas transcription of nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent genes, including rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, and rpl23, was elevated. The expression of UMPK was significantly induced by various stresses, including cold, heat, and drought. Increased sensitivity to cold stress was observed in the mutant, based on the survival rate and malondialdehyde content. High accumulation of hydrogen peroxide was found in the mutant, which was enhanced by cold treatment. Our results indicate that the UMP kinase gene plays important roles in regulating chloroplast development and stress response in rice.","Mast Cells, Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis in Human Gastric Cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035644,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Gastric cancer is diagnosed in nearly one million new patients each year and it remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although gastric cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases, chronic inflammation has been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis. Cancer development is a multistep process characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations during tumour initiation and progression. The stromal microenvironment is important in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis or promoting tumour development. A plethora of immune cells (i.e., lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Treg cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells) are components of gastric cancer microenvironment. Mast cell density is increased in gastric cancer and there is a correlation with angiogenesis, the number of metastatic lymph nodes and the survival of these patients. Mast cells exert a protumorigenic role in gastric cancer through the release of angiogenic (VEGF-A, CXCL8, MMP-9) and lymphangiogenic factors (VEGF-C and VEGF-F). Gastric mast cells express the programmed death ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) which are relevant as immune checkpoints in cancer. Several clinical undergoing trials targeting immune checkpoints could be an innovative therapeutic strategy in gastric cancer. Elucidation of the role of subsets of mast cells in different human gastric cancers will demand studies of increasing complexity beyond those assessing merely mast cell density and microlocalization.",Adeno-Associated Virus VP1u Exhibits Protease Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035643,Viruses,2019 04 30,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are being developed for gene delivery applications, with more than 100 ongoing clinical trials aimed at the treatment of monogenic diseases. In this study, the unique N-terminus of AAV capsid viral protein 1 (VP1u), containing a canonical group XIII PLA2 enzyme domain, was observed to also exhibit proteolytic activity. This protease activity can target casein and gelatin, two standard substrates used for testing protease function but does not self-cleave in the context of the capsid or target globular proteins, for example, bovine serum albumin (BSA). However, heated BSA is susceptible to VP1u-mediated cleavage, suggesting that disordered proteins are substrates for this protease function. The protease activity is partially inhibited by divalent cation chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and human alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), a non-specific protease inhibitor. Interestingly, both the bovine pancreatic (group VIIA) and bee venom (group III) PLA2 enzymes also exhibit protease function against casein. This indicates that PLA2 groups, including VP1u, have a protease function. Amino acid substitution of the PLA2 catalytic motif (76HD/AN) in the AAV2 VP1u resulted in attenuation of protease activity, suggesting that the protease and PLA2 active sites are related. However, the amino acid substitution of histidine H38, which is not involved in PLA2 function, to alanine, also affects protease activity, suggesting that the active site/mechanism of the PLA2 and protease function are not identical.","Epidemiological, Molecular, and Clinical Features of Norovirus Infections among Pediatric Patients in Qatar.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035642,Viruses,2019 04 30,"Norovirus (NoV) is recognized as the second most important etiological agent leading to acute gastroenteritis globally.

The principal motion of material removal is performed through the axial oscillation of the abrasive belt, and the different material removal at different positions can be obtained through servo control of the machine tool spindle by removing high error spots on the cylindrical surface and finally deterministically corrects the roundness error. An abrasive belt-based deterministic figuring device was built, and the figuring experiments were performed on the surface of steel workpieces 100 mm in diameter and 130 mm in effective length. The roundness errors of the entire workpiece after twice figuring iterations decreased nearly from the initial 3 μm to 1 μm, which preliminary verified the feasibility of this method. This deterministic figuring method is expected to break the machining accuracy limit and improve the rotation precision of the precision shaft parts such as the aerostatic spindle.",Direction of Arrival Estimation Using Two Hydrophones: Frequency Diversity Technique for Passive Sonar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035640,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The traditional passive azimuth estimation algorithm using two hydrophones, such as cross-correlation time-delay estimation and cross-spectral phase estimation, requires a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to ensure the clarity of the estimated target trajectory. This paper proposes an algorithm to apply the frequency diversity technique to passive azimuth estimation. The algorithm also uses two hydrophones but can obtain clear trajectories at a lower SNR. Firstly, the initial phase of the signal at different frequencies is removed by calculating the cross-spectral density matrix. Then, phase information between frequencies is used for beamforming. In this way, the frequency dimension information is used to improve the signal processing gain. This paper theoretically analyzes the resolution and processing gain of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the target azimuth robustly under the conditions of a single target (SNR = -16 dB) and multiple targets (SNR = -10 dB), while the cross-correlation algorithm cannot. Finally, the algorithm is tested by the swell96 data and the South Sea experimental data. When dealing with rich frequency signals, the performance of the algorithm using two hydrophones is even better than that of the conventional broadband beamforming of the 64-element array. This further validates the effectiveness and advantages of the algorithm.",Performance Bound for Joint Multiple Parameter Target Estimation in Sparse Stepped-Frequency Radar: A Comparison Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035639,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"A performance bound-Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for target estimation and detection in sparse stepped frequency radars is presented. The vector formulation of this CRLB is used to obtain a lower bound on the estimation error. The estimation performance can be transformed into different types of CRLB structures. Therefore, the expressions of bounds under three equivalent models are derived separately: time delay and Doppler stretch estimator, joint multiple parameter estimator, and sparse-based estimator. The variables to be estimated include the variances of unknown noise, range, velocity, and the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude. A general performance expression is proposed by considering the echo of the target in the line-of-sight. When the relationship between CRLB and various parameters are discussed in detail, the specific effect of waveform parameters on a single CRLB is compared and analyzed. Numerical simulations demonstrated that the resulting CRLB exhibits considerable theoretical and practical significance for the selection of optimal waveform parameters."

Monitoring the concentration of the toxic gas at many locations over several days for a given structure or container can be challenging. In this study, a commercially-available system that wirelessly measures phosphine was evaluated in small-scale and large-scale tests. Small-scale testing was performed to study the repeatability and accuracy of the sensors. The wireless sensors were within 30 ppm of each other, over a range of 700 ppm phosphine. Large-scale testing evaluated the system during the fumigation of wheat stored in 7 m diameter, 120 metric ton, steel grain bins. As a reference, monitoring lines were distributed at several positions and depths in the bin in order to sample phosphine gas concentrations. A series of three fumigation trials were performed, with each lasting for over six days. The wireless devices collected local phosphine concentrations and temperatures every two hours without assistance from personnel. Although the fumigation trials were significantly different in terms of patterns in gas concentration over time, the two sampling methods gave similar trendlines. However, the automated data provided a more detailed picture of the fumigation process. This information may help fumigation managers to better evaluate fumigations and assure successful insect control.","Social Integration, Social Support, and All-Cause, Cardiovascular Disease and Cause-Specific Mortality: A Prospective Cohort Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035622,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Social relationships are associated with all-cause mortality. Substantial uncertainties remain, however, for the associations of social relationships with mortality from subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and major non-vascular diseases. This prospective cohort study estimated mortality risks according to social support and social integration utilizing a nationally representative sample of 29,179 adults ages 18 years and older. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed. Social integration, but not social support was associated with all-cause mortality risk. For CVD mortality, social integration predicted a 33% lower risk (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.53-0.86). The results were similar in magnitude for heart disease mortality. Participants with the highest social integration level had a 53%, 30%, and 47% decreased mortality risk of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD) than those with the lowest level. These social integration associations were linear and consistent across baseline age, sex and socioeconomic status. We did not observe an association of social integration with the risk of cancer mortality.

However, in the context of climate change, the response of vegetation Net Primary Production (NPP) in this region has not been scientifically studied in depth. NPP suffers from the comprehensive effect of multiple climatic factors, and how to eliminate the effect of interfering variables in the correlation analysis of NPP and target variables (temperature or precipitation) is the major challenge in the study of NPP influencing factors. The correlation coefficient between NPP and target variable was calculated by ignoring other variables that also had a large impact on NPP. This increased the uncertainty of research results. Therefore, in this study, the second-order partial correlation analysis method was used to analyze the correlation between NPP and target variables by controlling other variables. This can effectively decrease the uncertainty of analysis results. In this paper, the univariate linear regression, coefficient of variation, and Hurst index estimation were used to study the spatial and temporal variations in NPP and analyze whether the NPP seasonal and annual variability will persist into the future. The results show the following: (i) The spatial distribution of NPP correlated with precipitation and had a gradually decreasing trend from southeast to northwest. From 2000 to 2015, the NPP in the study area had a general upward trend, with a small variation in its range. (ii) Areas with negative partial correlation coefficients between NPP and precipitation are consistent with the areas with more abundant water resources. The partial correlation coefficient between the NPP and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) was positive for 52.64% of the total study area. Finally, the prediction of the persistence of NPP variation into the future showed significant differences on varying time scales. On an annual scale, NPP was predicted to persist for 46% of the study area. On a seasonal scale, NPP in autumn was predicted to account for 49.92%, followed by spring (25.67%), summer (13.40%), and winter (6.75%).",Crack Detection of FRP-Reinforced Concrete Beam Using Embedded Piezoceramic Smart Aggregates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035619,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this paper, the authors present a stress wave-based active sensing method to detect the crack in FRP-reinforced concrete beams. The embedded smart aggregates (SAs), which utilize Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) as transducers, are employed in this research to generate and sense the stress wave. Three specimens are involved in the experimental program and each is made of concrete, longitudinal distributed reinforcement, steel stirrups, main bar (FRP bar or steel bar), and four SAs. A pair of SAs installed on the lower part of the main bar and the other pair of SAs mounted on the upper part of main bar are utilized to monitor the crack occurrence and development in the three test specimens. The signals received by the SA sensors are analyzed in both time domain and frequency domain. The wavelet packet energy is used to extract damage features. The applied load-vertical displacement curves of mid-span in the specimen are obtained. Experimental results show the test specimens experience crushing failure when the concrete compression exceeds its compressive strength. Increasing the contact area between FRP bar and concrete can effectively improve the cracking load of the FRP-reinforced concrete beam and reduce the cracking speed and depth of FRP-reinforced concrete beam; on the other hand, increasing the elastic modulus of the main bar can slow down the crack development of concrete on the upper side of the main bar and decrease the displacement of reinforced concrete beam during the loading test process. The research results show that the developed piezoceramic-based active sensing method, though low-cost, can monitor the crack-induced damage and estimate the process of damage degree in real-time, and has potentials to provide an early warning of crack occurrence and development for FRP-reinforced concrete beams.",Genetic Predispositions of Glucocorticoid Resistance and Therapeutic Outcomes in Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Giant Cell Arteritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035618,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are closely related chronic inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are first-choice drugs for PMR and GCA, although some patients show poor responsiveness to the initial GC regimen or experience flares after GC tapering. To date, no valid biomarkers have been found to predict which patients are at most risk for developing GC resistance. In this review, we summarize PMR- and GCA-related gene polymorphisms and we associate these gene variants with GC resistance and therapeutic outcomes. A limited number of GC resistance associated-polymorphisms have been published so far, mostly related to HLA-DRB1*04 allele. Other genes such ICAM-1, TLR4 and 9, VEGF, and INFG may play a role, although discrepancies are often found among different populations. We conclude that more studies are required to identify reliable biomarkers of GC resistance. Such biomarkers could help distinguish non-responders from responders to GC treatment, with concomitant consequences for therapeutic strategy."

The aim of this study was to use matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology for identification of staphylococci isolated from bovine milk at species level and to characterize them in reference to presentation, somatic cell count (SCC), bacterial shedding (cfu) and antimicrobial resistance patterns. A total of 200 staphylococcal isolates (S. aureus n = 100; CNS n = 100) originating from aseptically collected quarter milk samples from different quarters of dairy cows were included in the study. They originated from cases of clinical (CM) and subclinical mastitis (SCM) or were isolated from milk with SCC ≤ 100,000 cells/mL in pure culture. We found staphylococci predominantly in cases of SCM (n = 120). In low-SCC cows, 12 S. aureus and 32 CNS isolates were detected. Eighteen percent of each were associated with CM. Eleven CNS species were identified, S. chromogenes (n = 26) and S. xylosus (n = 40) predominated. CNS, particularly those in low-SCC cows, showed higher MIC90 (minimal inhibitory concentration) values for penicillin, ampicillin, cefoperazone, pirlimycin and marbofloxacin. Based on the present results, a careful interpretation of laboratory results is recommended to avoid antimicrobial therapy of staphylococci without clinical relevance and to ensure prudent use of antimicrobials.",Underwater Target Localization and Synchronization for a Distributed SIMO Sonar with an Isogradient SSP and Uncertainties in Receiver Locations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035606,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"A distributed single-input multiple-output (SIMO) sonar system is composed of a sound source and multiple underwater receivers. It provides an important framework for underwater target localization. However, underwater hostile environments bring more challenges for underwater target localization than terrestrial target localization, such as the difficulties of synchronizing all the underwater receiver clocks, the varying underwater sound speed and the uncertainties of the locations of the underwater receivers. In this paper, we take the sound speed variation, the time synchronization and the uncertainties of the receiver locations into account, and propose the underwater target localization and synchronization (UTLS) algorithm for the distributed SIMO sonar system. In the distributed SIMO sonar system, the receivers are organized in a star topology, where the information fusion is carried out in the central receiver (CR). All the receivers are not synchronized and their positions are known with uncertainties. Moreover, the underwater sound speed is approximately modeled by a depth-dependent sound speed profile (SSP). We evaluate our proposed UTLS algorithm by comparing it with several benchmark algorithms via numerical simulations. The simulation results reveal the superiority of our proposed UTLS algorithm.",Dynamics of Dual Specificity Phosphatases and Their Interplay with Protein Kinases in Immune Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035605,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) have a well-known role as regulators of the immune response through the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Yet the precise interplay between the various members of the DUSP family with protein kinases is not well understood. Recent multi-omics studies characterizing the transcriptomes and proteomes of immune cells have provided snapshots of molecular mechanisms underlying innate immune response in unprecedented detail. In this study, we focus on deciphering the interplay between members of the DUSP family with protein kinases in immune cells using publicly available omics datasets. Our analysis resulted in the identification of potential DUSP-mediated hub proteins including MAPK7, MAPK8, AURKA, and IGF1R. Furthermore, we analyzed the association of DUSP expression with TLR4 signaling and identified VEGF, FGFR, and SCF-KIT pathway modules to be regulated by the activation of TLR4 signaling. Finally, we identified several important kinases including LRRK2, MAPK8, and cyclin-dependent kinases as potential DUSP-mediated hubs in TLR4 signaling. The findings from this study have the potential to aid in the understanding of DUSP signaling in the context of innate immunity. Further, this will promote the development of therapeutic modalities for disorders with aberrant DUSP signaling.",Relevance of Targeting the Distal Renal Artery and Branches with Radiofrequency Renal Denervation Approaches-A Secondary Analysis from a Hypertensive CKD Patient Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035604,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"We searched for an association between changes in blood pressure (BP) at 12 and 24 months after renal denervation (RDN) and the different patterns of ablation spots placement along the renal artery vasculature. We performed a post-hoc analysis of a 24-month follow-up evaluation of 30 patients who underwent RDN between 2011 and 2012 using our previous database. Patients who had (i) resistant hypertension, as meticulously described previously, and (ii) Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 2, 3 and 4. Correlations were assessed using the Pearson or Spearman correlation tests as appropriate. The mean change in systolic ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) compared to baseline was -19.4 ± 12.7 mmHg at the 12th (p < 0.0001) and -21.3 ± 14.1 mmHg at the 24th month (p < 0.0001). There was no correlation between the ABPM Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)-lowering effect and the total number of ablated spots in renal arteries (17.7 ± 6.0) either at 12 (r = -0.3, p = 0.1542) or at 24 months (r = -0.2, p = 0.4009). However, correlations between systolic BP-lowering effect and the number of ablation spots performed in the distal segment and branches were significant at the 12 (r = -0.7, p < 0.0001) and 24 months (r = -0.8, p < 0.0001) follow-up. Our findings indicate a substantial correlation between the numbers of ablated sites in the distal segment and branches of renal arteries and the systolic BP-lowering effect in the long-term.",Occurrence and Function of the Na+-Translocating NADH:Quinone Oxidoreductase in Prevotella spp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035603,Microorganisms,2019 04 30,"Strictly anaerobic Prevotella spp. are characterized by their vast metabolic potential. As members of the Prevotellaceae family, they represent the most abundant organisms in the rumen and are typically found in monogastrics such as pigs and humans. Within their largely anoxic habitats, these bacteria are considered to rely primarily on fermentation for energy conservation. A recent study of the rumen microbiome identified multiple subunits of the Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) belonging to different Prevotella spp. Commonly, the NQR is associated with biochemical energy generation by respiration. The existence of this Na+ pump in Prevotella spp. may indicate an important role for electrochemical Na+ gradients in their anaerobic metabolism. However, detailed information about the potential activity of the NQR in Prevotella spp. is not available. Here, the presence of a functioning NQR in the strictly anaerobic model organism P. bryantii B14 was verified by conducting mass spectrometric, biochemical, and kinetic experiments. Our findings propose that P.bryantii B14 and other Prevotella spp. retrieved from the rumen operate a respiratory NQR together with a fumarate reductase which suggests that these ruminal bacteria utilize a sodium motive force generated during respiratory NADH:fumarate oxidoreduction.",Incidental Finding of Strut Malapposition Is a Predictor of Late and Very Late Thrombosis in Coronary Bioresorbable Scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035602,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"Malapposition is a common finding in stent and scaffold thrombosis (ScT). Evidence from studies with prospective follow-up, however, is scarce. We hypothesized that incidental observations of strut malapposition might be predictive of late ScT during subsequent follow-up. One hundred ninety-seven patients were enrolled in a multicentre registry with prospective follow-up. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), performed in an elective setting, was available in all at 353 (0-376) days after bioresorbable scaffold (BRS) implantation. Forty-four patients showed evidence of malapposition that was deemed not worthy of intervention. Malapposition was not associated with any clinical or procedural parameter except for a higher implantation pressure (p = 0.0008). OCT revealed that malapposition was associated with larger vessel size, less eccentricity (all p < 0.01), and a tendency for more uncovered struts (p = 0.06). Late or very late ScT was recorded in seven of these patients 293 (38-579) days after OCT. OCT-diagnosed malapposition was a predictor of late and very late scaffold thrombosis (p < 0.001) that was independent of the timing of diagnosis. We provide evidence that an incidental finding of malapposition-regardless of the timing of diagnosis of the malapposition-during an elective exam is a predictor of late and very late ScT. Our data provide a rationale to consider prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy if strut malapposition is observed.",Flavonoids and the Risk of Gastric Cancer: An Exploratory Case-Control Study in the MCC-Spain Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035601,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"Several epidemiological studies have investigated the association between the dietary flavonoid intake and gastric cancer (GC) risk; however, the results remain inconclusive. Investigating the relationship between the different classes of flavonoids and the histological types and origin of GC can be of interest to the research community. We used data from a population-based multi-case control study (MCC-Spain) obtained from 12 different regions of Spain. 2700 controls and 329 GC cases were included in this study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using the mixed effects logistic regression considering quartiles of flavonoid intakes and log2. Flavonoid intake was associated with a lower GC risk (ORlog2 = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.65-0.89; ORq4vsq1 = 0.60; 95%CI = 0.40-0.89; ptrend = 0.007). Inverse and statistically significant associations were observed with anthocyanidins, chalcones, dihydroflavonols and flavan-3-ols. The isoflavanoid intake was positively associated with higher cancer risk, but without reaching a statistical significance. In general, no differences were observed in the GC risk according to the location and histological type. The flavonoid intake seems to be a protective factor against GC within the MCC-study. This effect may vary depending on the flavonoid class but not by the histological type and location of the tumor. Broader studies with larger sample size and greater geographical variability are necessary.",Molecular Biomarkers in Fragile X Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035599,Brain sciences,2019 04 30,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability (ID) and a known monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is a trinucleotide repeat disorder, in which more than 200 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene causes methylation of the promoter with consequent silencing of the gene, ultimately leading to the loss of the encoded fragile X mental retardation 1 protein, FMRP. FMRP is an RNA binding protein that plays a primary role as a repressor of translation of various mRNAs, many of which are involved in the maintenance and development of neuronal synaptic function and plasticity. In addition to intellectual disability, patients with FXS face several behavioral challenges, including anxiety, hyperactivity, seizures, repetitive behavior, and problems with executive and language performance. Currently, there is no cure or approved medication for the treatment of the underlying causes of FXS, but in the past few years, our knowledge about the proteins and pathways that are dysregulated by the loss of FMRP has increased, leading to clinical trials and to the path of developing molecular biomarkers for identifying potential targets for therapies. In this paper, we review candidate molecular biomarkers that have been identified in preclinical studies in the FXS mouse animal model and are now under validation for human applications or have already made their way to clinical trials.",Dendritic Cell-Based Immunotherapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035598,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal proliferation of myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The outcome of AML is poor, with five-year overall survival rates of less than 10% for the predominant group of patients older than 65 years. One of the main reasons for this poor outcome is that the majority of AML patients will relapse, even after they have attained complete remission by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, supplemented with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients at high risk of relapse, is still the cornerstone of current AML treatment. Both therapies are, however, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These observations illustrate the need for more effective and less toxic treatment options, especially in elderly AML and have fostered the development of novel immune-based strategies to treat AML. One of these strategies involves the use of a special type of immune cells, the dendritic cells (DCs). As central orchestrators of the immune system, DCs are key to the induction of anti-leukemia immunity. In this review, we provide an update of the clinical experience that has been obtained so far with this form of immunotherapy in patients with AML.",The Association of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors with Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Sleep Duration in Preschool Children-Study Protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035596,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Currently, there is no consensus regarding the benefits of physical activity in terms of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) among different age groups of children. The number of school students avoiding physical education is on the rise. Children of all ages spend more time on sedentary behavior, eat less nutritious food and spend less time sleeping. All of these concomitant aspects adversely affect the immune system. A coexisting problem of a growing society is a large number of URTIs which is the main reason for general practitioner intervention. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a correlation between the frequency of respiratory tract infections and the level of physical exercise in a cohort of pre-school children. This will be a cross-sectional, short-term study conducted on a single study population. We aim to recruit four-, to seven-year-old children who will be receiving activity monitoring devices for 24 h a day for 40 days. Daily step count, mean intensity of physical exercise and sleep duration will be measured. Simultaneously, their parents will receive a series of 60 questionnaires, one questionnaire per day, for the daily assessment of upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. Our study conducted on a cohort of healthy pre-school children using uniform tools, aims to scientifically establish and quantify the relationship between physical activity and health outcomes over a specified period of time."

Previous studies have suggested that dopamine may play a role in motor memory consolidation, but whether it is involved in the exercise effects on consolidation is unknown. Hence, we aimed to investigate the influence of dopaminergic pathways on the exercise-induced modulation of motor memory consolidation. We compared the effect of acute exercise on motor memory consolidation between the genotypes that are known to affect dopaminergic transmission and learning. By combining cluster analyses and fitting linear models with and without included polymorphisms, we provide preliminary evidence that exercise benefits the carriers of alleles that are associated with low synaptic dopamine content. In line with previous reports, our findings implicate dopamine as a modulator of the exercise-induced effects on motor memory consolidation, and suggest exercise as a potential clinical tool to counteract low endogenous dopamine bioavailability.

In this paper, a methyl-ammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) organic perovskite film was fabricated using a two-step sequential process on top of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) hole-transporting layer. Experimentally, water and potassium halides (KCl, KBr, and KI) were incorporated into the PbI2 precursor solution. With only 2 vol% water, the cell efficiency was effectively improved. Without water, the addition of all of the three potassium halides unanimously degraded the performance of the solar cells, although the crystallinity was improved. Co-doping with KI and water showed a pronounced improvement in crystallinity and the elimination of carrier traps, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.9%, which was approximately 60% higher than the pristine reference cell. The effect of metal halide and water co-doping in the PbI2 layer on the performance of organic perovskite solar cells was studied. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies indicated that a PbI2-dimethylformamide-water related adduct was formed upon co-doping. Photoluminescence enhancement was observed due to the co-doping of KI and water, indicating the defect density was reduced. Finally, the co-doping process was recommended for developing high-performance organic halide perovskite solar cells.",Distributed Acoustic Sensing of Strain at Earth Tide Frequencies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035581,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The solid Earth strains in response to the gravitational pull from the Moon, Sun, and other planetary bodies. Measuring the flexure of geologic material in response to these Earth tides provides information about the geomechanical properties of rock and sediment. Such measurements are particularly useful for understanding dilation of faults and fractures in competent rock. A new approach to measuring earth tides using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is presented here. DAS was originally designed to record acoustic vibration through the measurement of dynamic strain on a fiber optic cable. Here, laboratory experiments demonstrate that oscillating strain can be measured with DAS in the microHertz frequency range, corresponding to half-day (M2) lunar tidal cycles. Although the magnitude of strain measured in the laboratory is larger than what would be expected due to earth tides, a clear signal at half-day period was extracted from the data. With the increased signal-to-noise expected from quiet field applications and improvements to DAS using engineered fiber, earth tides could potentially be measured in deep boreholes with DAS. Because of the distributed nature of the sensor (0.25 m measurement interval over kilometres), fractures could be simultaneously located and evaluated. Such measurements would provide valuable information regarding the placement and stiffness of open fractures in bedrock. Characterization of bedrock fractures is an important goal for multiple subsurface operations such as petroleum extraction, geothermal energy recovery, and geologic carbon sequestration.",A Dual Ligand Sol⁻Gel Organic-Silica Hybrid Monolithic Capillary for In-Tube SPME-MS/MS to Determine Amino Acids in Plasma Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035579,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This work describes the direct coupling of the in-tube solid-phase microextraction (in-tube SPME) technique to a tandem mass spectrometry system (MS/MS) to determine amino acids (AA) and neurotransmitters (NT) (alanine, serine, isoleucine, leucine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, methionine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) in plasma samples from schizophrenic patients. An innovative organic-silica hybrid monolithic capillary with bifunctional groups (amino and cyano) was developed and evaluated as an extraction device for in-tube SPME. The morphological and structural aspects of the monolithic phase were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nitrogen sorption experiments, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, and adsorption experiments. In-tube SPME-MS/MS conditions were established to remove matrix, enrich analytes (monolithic capillary) and improve the sensitivity of the MS/MS system. The proposed method was linear from 45 to 360 ng mL-1 for alanine, from 15 to 300 ng mL-1 for leucine and isoleucine, from 12 to 102 ng mL-1 for methionine, from 10 to 102 ng mL-1 for tyrosine, from 9 to 96 ng mL-1 for tryptophan, from 12 to 210 ng mL-1 for serine, from 12 to 90 ng mL-1 for glutamic acid, from 12 to 102 ng mL-1 for lysine, and from 6 to 36 ng mL-1 for aspartic acid. The precision of intra-assays and inter-assays presented CV values ranged from 1.6% to 14.0%. The accuracy of intra-assays and inter-assays presented RSE values from -11.0% to 13.8%, with the exception of the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values.

Although surgery is a successful method to restore vision loss due to cataracts, post-surgical complications can occur, such as secondary cataracts, also known as posterior capsular opacification (PCO). PCO arises when lens epithelial cells (LEC) are left behind in the capsular bag following surgery and are induced to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Following EMT, LEC morphology and phenotype are altered leading to a loss of transparency and vision. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced signaling through both canonical, TGF-β/Smad, and non-canonical, β-catenin/Wnt and Rho/ROCK/MRTF-A, pathways have been shown to be involved in lens EMT, and thus PCO. However, the interactions between these signaling pathways in the lens have not been thoroughly explored. In the current study we use rat LEC explants as an ex vivo model, to examine the interplay between three TGF-β-mediated pathways using α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) as a molecular marker for EMT. We show that Smad3 inhibition via SIS3 prevents nuclear translocation of β-catenin and MRTF-A, and α-SMA expression, suggesting a key role of Smad3 in regulation of MRTF-A and β-catenin nuclear transport in LECs. Further, we demonstrate that inhibition of β-catenin/CBP interaction by ICG-001 decreased the amount of phosphorylated Smad3 upon TGF-β stimulation in addition to significantly decreasing the expression levels of TGF-β receptors, TBRII and TBRI. Overall, our findings demonstrate interdependence between the canonical and non-canonical TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways controlling EMT in the lens.","Hydrogeochemical Characterization and Irrigation Quality Assessment of Shallow Groundwater in the Central-Western Guanzhong Basin, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035576,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Groundwater is the major water resource for the agricultural development of the Guanzhong Basin, China.

The average concentration of ions (except for Ca2+) in SBWR samples is lower than in NBWR samples. HCO3- is dominant in the groundwater of the study area. Ca2+ is dominant in the SBWR while Na+ is dominant in the NBWR. The SBWR groundwater is mainly of the HCO3-Ca·Mg type, and has undergone the main hydrogeochemical processes of rock weathering-leaching. The hydrochemical facies of the majority of the NBWR groundwater samples are the HCO3-Na type with several minor hydrochemical facies of the HCO3-Ca·Mg, SO4·Cl-Na, and SO4·Cl-Ca·Mg types. Its chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering, cation exchange, and evaporation. Salinity hazard, sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium hazard, permeability index, Kelley's ratio, potential salinity, synthetic harmful coefficient, and irrigation coefficient were assessed to evaluate the irrigation quality of groundwater. The results of the comprehensive consideration of these indicators indicate that the percentage of NBWR water samples suitable for irrigation purposes ranges between 15.7% and 100% at an average level of 56.7%. Of the SBWR water samples suitable for irrigation, the percentage ranges from 78.3% to 100% with an average of 91.8%. Land irrigated with such water will not be exposed to any alkali hazard, but will suffer from a salinity hazard, which is more severe in the NBWR. Thus, most of the water in the NBWR can be used for soils with good drainage conditions which control salinity.","The Usual Suspects 2019: of Chips, Droplets, Synthesis, and Artificial Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035574,Micromachines,2019 04 30,"Synthetic biology aims to understand fundamental biological processes in more detail than possible for actual living cells. Synthetic biology can combat decomposition and build-up of artificial experimental models under precisely controlled and defined environmental and biochemical conditions. Microfluidic systems can provide the tools to improve and refine existing synthetic systems because they allow control and manipulation of liquids on a micro- and nanoscale. In addition, chip-based approaches are predisposed for synthetic biology applications since they present an opportune technological toolkit capable of fully automated high throughput and content screening under low reagent consumption. This review critically highlights the latest updates in microfluidic cell-free and cell-based protein synthesis as well as the progress on chip-based artificial cells. Even though progress is slow for microfluidic synthetic biology, microfluidic systems are valuable tools for synthetic biology and may one day help to give answers to long asked questions of fundamental cell biology and life itself.",Advanced Strategies for Food-Grade Protein Production: A New E. coli/Lactic Acid Bacteria Shuttle Vector for Improved Cloning and Food-Grade Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035573,Microorganisms,2019 04 30,"Food-grade production of recombinant proteins in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in LAB (i.e., Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus), is of great interest in the areas of recombinant enzyme production, industrial food fermentation, gene and metabolic engineering, as well as antigen delivery for oral vaccination. Food-grade expression relies on hosts generally considered as safe organisms and on clone selection not dependent on antibiotic markers, which limit the overall DNA manipulation workflow, as it can be carried out only in the expression host and not in E. coli. Moreover, many commercial expression vectors lack useful elements for protein purification. We constructed a ""shuttle"" vector containing a removable selective marker, which allows feasible cloning steps in E. coli and subsequent protein expression in LAB. In fact, the cassette can be easily excised from the selected recombinant plasmid, and the resulting marker-free vector transformed into the final LAB host. Further useful elements, as improved MCS, 6xHis-Tag, and thrombin cleavage site sequences were introduced. The resulting vector allows easy cloning in E. coli, can be quickly converted in a food-grade expression vector and harbors additional elements for improved recombinant protein purification. Overall, such features make the new vector an improved tool for food-grade expression.",Melatonin Levels in Preterm and Term Infants and Their Mothers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035572,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The prevention of perinatal brain damage following preterm birth remains a public health priority. Melatonin has been shown to be a promising neuroprotectant in neonatal preclinical models of brain damage, but few studies have investigated melatonin secretion in newborns. We hypothesized that melatonin circulating levels would be lower in preterm compared to term infants. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study to assess melatonin, and 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (aMT6s) concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay. Among 209 neonates recruited, 110 were born before 34 gestational weeks (GW) and 99 born after 34 GW. Plasma melatonin concentrations, measured at birth and on Day 3 were below detectable levels (≤7 pg/mL) in 78% and 81%, respectively, of infants born before 34 GW compared to 57% and 34%, respectively, of infants born after 34 GW. The distribution of plasma melatonin concentrations was found to be correlated with gestational age at both time-points (p < 0.001). Median urine aMT6s concentrations were significantly lower in infants born before 34 GW, both on Day 1 (230 ng/L vs. 533 ng/L, p < 0.0001) and on Day 3 (197 ng/L vs. 359 ng/L, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, melatonin secretion appears very low in preterm infants, providing the rationale for testing supplemental melatonin as a neuroprotectant in clinical trials.",Identification and Characterization of a Novel Robigovirus Species from Sweet Cherry in Turkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035571,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"High throughput sequencing of total RNA isolated from symptomatic leaves of a sweet cherry tree (Prunus avium cv. 0900 Ziraat) from Turkey identified a new member of the genus Robigovirus designated cherry virus Turkey (CVTR). The presence of the virus was confirmed by electron microscopy and overlapping RT-PCR for sequencing its whole-genome. The virus has a ssRNA genome of 8464 nucleotides which encodes five open reading frames (ORFs) and comprises two non-coding regions, 5' UTR and 3' UTR of 97 and 296 nt, respectively. Compared to the five most closely related robigoviruses, RdRp, TGB1, TGB2, TGB3 and CP share amino acid identities ranging from 43-53%, 44-60%, 39-43%, 38-44% and 45-50%, respectively. Unlike the four cherry robigoviruses, CVTR lacks ORFs 2a and 5a. Its genome organization is therefore more similar to African oil palm ringspot virus (AOPRV). Using specific primers, the presence of CVTR was confirmed in 15 sweet cherries and two sour cherries out of 156 tested samples collected from three regions in Turkey. Among them, five samples were showing slight chlorotic symptoms on the leaves. It seems that CVTR infects cherry trees with or without eliciting obvious symptoms, but these data should be confirmed by bioassays in woody and possible herbaceous hosts in future studies."

Within-host models, however, are not often fit to experimental data, which can serve as a robust method of hypothesis testing and hypothesis generation. In this study, we use mechanistic models and empirical, time-series data of viral titer to better understand the replication of ranaviruses within their amphibian hosts and the immune dynamics that limit viral replication. Specifically, we fit a suite of potential models to our data, where each model represents a hypothesis about the interactions between viral replication and immune defense. Through formal model comparison, we find a parsimonious model that captures key features of our time-series data: The viral titer rises and falls through time, likely due to an immune system response, and that the initial viral dosage affects both the peak viral titer and the timing of the peak. Importantly, our model makes several predictions, including the existence of long-term viral infections, which can be validated in future studies.",The Mortality Response to Absolute and Relative Temperature Extremes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035559,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"While the impact of absolute extreme temperatures on human health has been amply studied, far less attention has been given to relative temperature extremes, that is, events that are highly unusual for the time of year but not necessarily extreme relative to a location's overall climate. In this research, we use a recently defined extreme temperature event metric to define absolute extreme heat events (EHE) and extreme cold events (ECE) using absolute thresholds, and relative extreme heat events (REHE) and relative extreme cold events (RECE) using relative thresholds. All-cause mortality outcomes using a distributed lag nonlinear model are evaluated for the largest 51 metropolitan areas in the US for the period 1975-2010. Both the immediate impacts and the cumulative 20-day impacts are assessed for each of the extreme temperature event types. The 51 metropolitan areas were then grouped into 8 regions for meta-analysis. For heat events, the greatest mortality increases occur with a 0-day lag, with the subsequent days showing below-expected mortality (harvesting) that decreases the overall cumulative impact. For EHE, increases in mortality are still statistically significant when examined over 20 days. For REHE, it appears as though the day-0 increase in mortality is short-term displacement. For cold events, both relative and absolute, there is little mortality increase on day 0, but the impacts increase on subsequent days. Cumulative impacts are statistically significant at more than half of the stations for both ECE and RECE. The response to absolute ECE is strongest, but is also significant when using RECE across several southern locations, suggesting that there may be a lack of acclimatization, increasing mortality in relative cold events both early and late in winter.",Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Biological Process and Key Pathway in Three Cotton (Gossypium spp.) Species Under Drought Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035558,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses that seriously affects cotton growth, development, and production worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism, key pathway, and responsible genes for drought tolerance incotton have not been stated clearly. In this research, high-throughput next generation sequencing technique was utilized to investigate gene expression profiles of three cotton species (Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium arboreum, and Gossypium barbadense L.) under drought stress. A total of 6968 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, where 2053, 742, and 4173 genes were tested as statistically significant; 648, 320, and 1998 genes were up-regulated, and 1405, 422, and 2175 were down-regulated in TM-1, Zhongmian-16, and Pima4-S, respectively. Total DEGs were annotated and classified into functional groups under gene ontology analysis. The biological process was present only in tolerant species(TM-1), indicating drought tolerance condition. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes showed the involvement of plant hormone signal transduction and metabolic pathways enrichment under drought stress. Several transcription factors associated with ethylene-responsive genes (ICE1, MYB44, FAMA, etc.) were identified as playing key roles in acclimatizing to drought stress. Drought also caused significant changes in the expression of certain functional genes linked to abscisic acid (ABA) responses (NCED, PYL, PP2C, and SRK2E), reactive oxygen species (ROS) related in small heat shock protein and 18.1 kDa I heat shock protein, YLS3, and ODORANT1 genes. These results will provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of drought stress adaptation in cotton.",Visual IoT Security: Data Hiding in AMBTC Images Using Block-Wise Embedding Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035557,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This study investigates combining the property of human vision system and a 2-phase data hiding strategy to improve the visual quality of data-embedded compressed images. The visual Internet of Things (IoT) is indispensable in smart cities, where different sources of visual data are collected for more efficient management. With the transmission through the public network, security issue becomes critical. Moreover, for the sake of increasing transmission efficiency, image compression is widely used. In order to respond to both needs, we present a novel data hiding scheme for image compression with Absolute Moment Block Truncation Coding (AMBTC). Embedding secure data in digital images has broad security uses, e.g., image authentication, prevention of forgery attacks, and intellectual property protection. The proposed method embeds data into an AMBTC block by two phases. In the intra-block embedding phase, a hidden function is proposed, where the five AMBTC parameters are extracted and manipulated to embed the secret data. In the inter-block embedding phase, the relevance of high mean and low mean values between adjacent blocks are exploited to embed additional secret data in a reversible way. Between these two embedding phases, a halftoning scheme called direct binary search is integrated to efficiently improve the image quality without changing the fixed parameters. The modulo operator is used for data extraction. The advantages of this study contain two aspects. First, data hiding is an essential area of research for increasing the IoT security. Second, hiding in compressed images instead of original images can improve the network transmission efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",Generation of Linear Traveling Waves in Piezoelectric Plates in Air and Liquid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035556,Micromachines,2019 04 30,"A micro- to milli-sized linear traveling wave (TW) actuator fabricated with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology is demonstrated. The device is a silicon cantilever actuated by piezoelectric aluminum nitride. Specifically designed top electrodes allow the generation of TWs at different frequencies, in air and liquid, by combining two neighboring resonant modes. This approach was supported by analytical calculations, and different TWs were measured on the same plate by laser Doppler vibrometry. Numerical simulations were also carried out and compared with the measurements in air, validating the wave features. A standing wave ratio as low as 1.45 was achieved in air, with a phase velocity of 652 m/s and a peak horizontal velocity on the device surface of 124 μm/s for a driving signal of 1 V at 921.9 kHz.

The applications of surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) as a detection technique have consistently shown its potential as a rapid and sensitive means with minimal sample preparation. In this study, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) in elliptical shapes were collected into a layer of ordered zirconia concave pores. The porous zirconia layer (pZrO2) was then deposited with Au NPs, denoted as Au NPs (x)/pZrO2, where x indicates the deposition thickness of Au NPs in nm. In the concave structure of pZrO2, Au-ZrO2 and Au-Au interactions provide a synergistic and physical mechanism of SERS, which is anticipated to collect and amplify SERS signals and thereafter improve the enhancement factor (EF) of Au NPs/pZrO2. By taking Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as the test molecule, EF of Au NPs/pZrO2 might reach to 7.0 × 107. Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2 was then optimized and competent to detect pesticides, e.g., phosmet and carbaryl at very low concentrations, corresponding to the maximum residue limits of each, i.e., 0.3 ppm and 0.2 ppm, respectively. Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2 also showed the effectiveness of distinguishing between phosmet and carbaryl under mixed conditions. Due to the strong affinities of the phosphoric groups and sulfur in phosmet to the Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2, the substrate exhibited selective detection to this particular pesticide. In this study, Au NPs (3.0)/pZrO2 has thus demonstrated trace detection of residual pesticides, due to the substrate design that intended to provide collective amplification of SERS.",Cognitive Control Facilitates Attentional Disengagement during Second Language Comprehension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035554,Brain sciences,2019 04 30,"Bilinguals learn to resolve conflict between their two languages and that skill has been hypothesized to create long-term adaptive changes in cognitive functioning. Yet, little is known about how bilinguals recruit cognitive control to enable efficient use of one of their languages, especially in the less skilled and more effortful second language (L2). Here we examined how real-time cognitive control engagement influences L2 sentence comprehension (i.e., conflict adaptation). We tested a group of English monolinguals and a group of L2 English speakers using a recently-developed cross-task adaptation paradigm. Stroop sequences were pseudo-randomly interleaved with a visual-world paradigm in which participants were asked to carry out spoken instructions that were either syntactically ambiguous or unambiguous. Consistent with previous research, eye-movement results showed that Stroop-related conflict improved the ability to engage correct-goal interpretations, and disengage incorrect-goal interpretations, during ambiguous instructions. Such cognitive-to-language modulations were similar in both groups, but only in the engagement piece. In the disengagement portion, the modulation emerged earlier in bilinguals than in monolinguals, suggesting group differences in attentional disengagement following cognitive control recruitment. Additionally, incorrect-goal eye-movements were modulated by individual differences in working memory, although differently for each group, suggesting an involvement of both language-specific and domain-general resources.",Sarcopenia Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment Mainly Due to Slow Gait Speed: Results from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035553,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Sarcopenia and cognitive impairment may share common risk factors and pathophysiological pathways. We examined the association between impairments in specific cognitive domains and sarcopenia (and its defining components) in community-dwelling older adults. We analyzed 1887 patients who underwent cognitive function tests and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from the baseline data of adults aged 70-84 years obtained from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study. Those with disability in activities of daily living, dementia, severe cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, musculoskeletal complaints, neurological disorders, or who were illiterate were excluded. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet, the Frontal Assessment Battery. For sarcopenia, we used the diagnostic criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 9.6% for men and 7.6% for women. Sarcopenia (odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.99) and slow gait speed (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.34-4.99) were associated with cognitive impairment in men. Only slow gait speed (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.05-3.36) was associated with cognitive impairment in women. Sarcopenia is associated with cognitive impairment mainly due to slow gait speed. Our results suggested that cognitive impairment domains, such as processing speed and executive function, are associated with sarcopenia-related slow gait speed.","Fabrication, Characterization, and Application of Large-Scale Uniformly Hybrid Nanoparticle-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Substrates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035552,Micromachines,2019 04 30,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates with high sensitivity and reproducibility are highly desirable for high precision and even molecular-level detection applications. Here, large-scale uniformly hybrid nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (NERS) substrates with high reproducibility and controllability were developed. Using oxygen plasma treatment, large-area and uniformly rough polystyrene sphere (URPS) arrays in conjunction with 20 nm Au films (AuURPS) were fabricated for SERS substrates. Au nanoparticles and clusters covered the surface of the URPS arrays, and this increased the Raman signal. In the detection of malachite green (MG), the fabricated NERS substrates have high reproducibility and sensitivity. The enhancement factor (EF) of Au nanoparticles and clusters was simulated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and the EF was more than 104. The measured EF of our developed substrate was more than 108 with a relative standard deviation as low as 6.64%-13.84% over 15 points on the substrate. The minimum limit for the MG molecules reached 50 ng/mL. Moreover, the Raman signal had a good linear relationship with the logarithmic concentration of MG, as it ranged from 50 ng/mL to 5 μg/mL.

The main problem with these systems is how to maintain the privacy of sensitive patient information. Due to not fully protecting the records from unauthorised users, EHR systems fail to provide privacy for protected health information. Weak security measures also allow authorised users to exceed their specific privileges to access medical records. Thus, some of the systems are not a trustworthy source and are undesirable for patients and healthcare providers. Therefore, an authorisation system that provides privacy when accessing patients' data is required to address these security issues. Specifically, security and privacy precautions should be raised for specific categories of users, doctor advisors, physician researchers, emergency doctors, and patients' relatives. Presently, these users can break into the electronic systems and even violate patients' privacy because of the privileges granted to them or the inadequate security and privacy mechanisms of these systems. To address the security and privacy problems associated with specific users, we develop the Pseudonymization and Anonymization with the XACML (PAX) modular system, which depends on client and server applications. It provides a security solution to the privacy issues and the problem of safe-access decisions for patients' data in the EHR. The~results of theoretical and experimental security analysis prove that PAX provides security features in preserving the privacy of healthcare users and is safe against known attacks."

In total, 369 patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) and the SF-36 at baseline and at two years post-operative at three tertiary academic hospitals. The corresponding MCID values were 3.6 (SF-36 physical component summary), 4.2 (SF-36 mental component summary), 5.4 (FACT-General total score), and 6.7 (FACT-Hep total score). The predictors of achieving postoperative MCID were significantly higher in patients who had low preoperative HRQoL score, advanced age, high education level, and high BMI (p < 0.05). However, patients with a high preoperative HRQoL score, high education level, high BMI, and low Charlson comorbidity index score were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.05).

However, the effects of inhibiting rumen methanogenesis on fermentation are incompletely understood even in in vitro rumen cultures, as the recovery of metabolic hydrogen ([H]) in the main fermentation products consistently decreases with methanogenesis inhibition, evidencing the existence of unaccounted [H] sinks. We hypothesized that inhibiting methanogenesis in rumen batch cultures would redirect [H] towards microbial amino acids (AA) biosynthesis as an alternative [H] sink to methane (CH4). The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of eight inhibitors of methanogenesis on digestion, fermentation and the production of microbial biomass and AA in rumen batch cultures growing on cellulose. Changes in the microbial community composition were also studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Inhibiting methanogenesis did not cause consistent changes in fermentation or the profile of AA, although the effects caused by the different inhibitors generally associated with the changes in the microbial community that they induced. Under the conditions of this experiment, inhibiting methanogenesis did not increase the importance of microbial AA synthesis as a [H] sink.","A Low-Cost, Passive Release Device for the Surveillance and Control of Mosquitoes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035536,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Mosquitoes continue to be a major threat to global health, and the ability to reliably monitor, catch, and kill mosquitoes via passive traps is of great importance.

Prevents Peripheral Inflammatory Pathway Activation by the Short-Term High-Fat Diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035535,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Juçara berry is a potential inflammatory modulator, rich in dietary fiber, fatty acids, and anthocyanins. Considering this, we evaluated the high-fat diet (HFD) intake supplemented with different doses of freeze-dried juçara pulp on the TLR4 pathway. Twenty-seven male Wistar rats with ad libitum access to food and water were divided into four experimental groups: control standard chow group (C); high-fat diet control group (HFC); high-fat diet juçara 0.25% group (HFJ0.25%); and high-fat diet juçara 0.5% group (HFJ0.5%). The inflammatory parameters were analyzed by ELISA and Western blotting in liver and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RET). The HFJ0.25% group had the energy intake, aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, and liver triacylglycerol accumulation reduced; also, the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) expression in RET were reduced. However, there were no changes in other protein expressions in liver and adipose tissue. Adiposity and pNFκBp50 had a positive correlation in HFC and HFJ0.5%, but not in the C group and HFJ0.25%. The necrosis hepatic score did not change with treatment; however, the serum (AST) levels and the hepatic triacylglycerol were increased in HFC and HFJ0.5%. These results demonstrated that one week of HFD intake triggered pro-inflammatory mechanisms and liver injury. Additionally, 0.25% juçara prevented inflammatory pathway activation, body weight gain, and liver damage.",Selenium in Germinated Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Increases the Stability of Its Oil Fraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035534,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Selenium is an essential mineral in human nutrition. In order to assess its effect on the stability of chickpea oil, seeds were germinated and tested with different amounts of sodium selenite (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/100g seeds) for four days. Oil was extracted from sprouted chickpea and its physical properties, fatty acid profile (FAME), oxidative stability index (OSI), lipase and lipoxygenase (LOX) activities, cellular antioxidant activity (CAA), and phenolics and carotenoids were assessed and compared to chickpea seed oil. The amount of chickpea oil and its acid value (AV) increased during germination. The OSI increased by 28%, 46% and 14% for 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/100g compared with non-selenium treated sprouts. Phenolics increased up to 36% and carotenoids reduced by half in germinated sprouts with and without selenium compared to seeds. Carotenoids increased by 16% in sprouts treated with 1.0 mg/100 g selenium compared to their counterparts without selenium. FAME was not affected by treatments but samples with the highest selenium concentration increased lipase activity by 19% and decreased lipoxygenase activity by 55% compared with untreated sprouts. The CAA of oils increased by 43% to 66% in all germinated treatments compared with seeds. Results suggest that Se-enriched chickpea sprouts could represent an excellent source of oil with a high OSI and CAA, associated with a reduction in LOX activity and an increase in phenolics, respectively.",A Protective Role of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor in Inflammation and Tumor Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035533,Cancers,2019 04 30,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is known for mediating the toxicity of environmental pollutants such as dioxins and numerous dioxin-like compounds, and is associated with the promotion of various malignancies, including lymphoma. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR), a ligand-independent, transcriptionally inactive AhR-like protein is known to repress AhR signaling through its ability to compete with the AhR for dimerization with the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT). While AhRR effectively blocks AhR signaling, several aspects of the mechanism of AhRR's functions are poorly understood, including suppression of inflammatory responses and its putative role as a tumor suppressor. In a transgenic mouse that overexpresses AhRR (AhRR Tg) we discovered that these mice suppress 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)- and inflammation-induced tumor growth after subcutaneous challenge of EL4 lymphoma cells. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) we found that AhRR overexpression suppresses the AhR-mediated anti-apoptotic response. The AhRR-mediated inhibition of apoptotic resistance was associated with a suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, which was dependent on activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the CAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ). These results provide mechanistic insights into the role of the AhRR to suppress inflammation and highlight the AhRR as a potential therapeutic target to suppress tumor growth.",Sialic Acid-Containing Glycans as Cellular Receptors for Ocular Human Adenoviruses: Implications for Tropism and Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035532,Viruses,2019 04 30,"Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are the most common cause of ocular infections. Species B human adenovirus type 3 (HAdV-B3) causes pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), whereas HAdV-D8, -D37, and -D64 cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). Recently, HAdV-D53, -D54, and -D56 emerged as new EKC-causing agents. HAdV-E4 is associated with both PCF and EKC. We have previously demonstrated that HAdV-D37 uses sialic acid (SA)-containing glycans as cellular receptors on human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, and the virus interaction with SA is mediated by the knob domain of the viral fiber protein. Here, by means of cell-based assays and using neuraminidase (a SA-cleaving enzyme), we investigated whether ocular HAdVs other than HAdV-D37 also use SA-containing glycans as receptors on HCE cells. We found that HAdV-E4 and -D56 infect HCE cells independent of SAs, whereas HAdV-D53 and -D64 use SAs as cellular receptors. HAdV-D8 and -D54 fiber knobs also bound to cell-surface SAs. Surprisingly, HCE cells were found resistant to HAdV-B3 infection. We also demonstrated that the SA-based molecule i.e., ME0462, designed to bind to SA-binding sites on the HAdV-D37 fiber knob, efficiently prevents binding and infection of several EKC-causing HAdVs. Surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ME0462 and fiber knobs. Altogether, we demonstrate that SA-containing glycans serve as receptors for multiple EKC-causing HAdVs, and, that SA-based compound function as a broad-spectrum antiviral against known and emerging EKC-causing HAdVs.","Synthesis, X-ray Analysis, Biological Evaluation and Molecular Docking Study of New Thiazoline Derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035531,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"A series of new thiazoline derivatives were synthesized. Structure analyses were accomplished employing 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, X-ray and MS techniques. The in vitro antitumor activities were assessed against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) and colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116) cell lines. The results revealed that the thiazolines 5b and 2c exhibited significant activity against the two cell lines. The in vitro antimicrobial screening showed that the thiazolines 2c, 5b and 5d showed promising inhibition activity against Salmonella sp. Additionally, the inhibition activity of thiazolines 2e and 5b against Escherichia coli was comparable to that of the reference compound gentamycin.",Hair of the Dog: Identification of a Cis-Regulatory Module Predicted to Influence Canine Coat Composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035530,Genes,2019 04 30,"Each domestic dog breed is characterized by a strict set of physical and behavioral characteristics by which breed members are judged and rewarded in conformation shows. One defining feature of particular interest is the coat, which is comprised of either a double- or single-layer of hair. The top coat contains coarse guard hairs and a softer undercoat, similar to that observed in wolves and assumed to be the ancestral state. The undercoat is absent in single-coated breeds which is assumed to be the derived state. We leveraged single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and whole genome sequence (WGS) data to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying a locus on chromosome (CFA) 28 which is strongly associated with coat number. Using WGS data, we identified a locus of 18.4 kilobases containing 62 significant variants within the intron of a long noncoding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) upstream of ADRB1. Multiple lines of evidence highlight the locus as a potential cis-regulatory module. Specifically, two variants are found at high frequency in single-coated dogs and are rare in wolves, and both are predicted to affect transcription factor (TF) binding. This report is among the first to exploit WGS data for both GWAS and variant mapping to identify a breed-defining trait."

In here, a significant improvement of the self-assembly process of DHBC in aqueous solution by utilizing a linear-brush macromolecular architecture is presented. The improved self-assembly behavior of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-b-poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PVP-b-P(OEGMA)) and its concentration dependency is investigated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) (apparent hydrodynamic radii ≈ 100-120 nm). Moreover, the DHBC assemblies can be non-covalently crosslinked with tannic acid via hydrogen bonding, which leads to the formation of small aggregates as well (apparent hydrodynamic radius ≈ 15 nm). Non-covalent crosslinking improves the self-assembly and stabilizes the aggregates upon dilution, reducing the concentration dependency of aggregate self-assembly. Additionally, the non-covalent aggregates can be disassembled in basic media. The presence of aggregates was studied via cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) and DLS before and after non-covalent crosslinking. Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation of the formed aggregate structures was performed, clearly showing the existence of polymer assemblies, particularly after non-covalent crosslinking. In summary, we report on the completely hydrophilic self-assembled structures in solution formed from fully biocompatible building entities in water.","Molecular Simulations with in-deMon2k QM/MM, a Tutorial-Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035516,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"deMon2k is a readily available program specialized in Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations within the framework of Auxiliary DFT. This article is intended as a tutorial-review of the capabilities of the program for molecular simulations involving ground and excited electronic states. The program implements an additive QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) module relying either on non-polarizable or polarizable force fields. QM/MM methodologies available in deMon2k include ground-state geometry optimizations, ground-state Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, Ehrenfest non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, and attosecond electron dynamics. In addition several electric and magnetic properties can be computed with QM/MM. We review the framework implemented in the program, including the most recently implemented options (link atoms, implicit continuum for remote environments, metadynamics, etc.), together with six applicative examples. The applications involve (i) a reactivity study of a cyclic organic molecule in water; (ii) the establishment of free-energy profiles for nucleophilic-substitution reactions by the umbrella sampling method; (iii) the construction of two-dimensional free energy maps by metadynamics simulations; (iv) the simulation of UV-visible absorption spectra of a solvated chromophore molecule; (v) the simulation of a free energy profile for an electron transfer reaction within Marcus theory; and (vi) the simulation of fragmentation of a peptide after collision with a high-energy proton.",Maternal Harsh Physical Parenting and Behavioral Problems in Children in Religious Families in Yemen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035515,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"The present study examined maternal religiosity as an underlying cultural factor in the effect of harsh physical parenting on child behavioral problems. Data was collected via a discipline observational task, religiosity-based vignettes, and a questionnaire in a group of 62 mothers and their children in slum areas in Yemen. Moderation and mediation models were tested, where the role of maternal religiosity as a predictor and a moderator in the association between harsh physical parenting and child behavioral problems was explored. Findings showed no direct association between harsh physical parenting, maternal religiosity, and child behavioral problems. However, maternal religiosity was found to significantly moderate the relationship between harsh physical parenting and child behavioral problems such that the positive association between harsh physical parenting and child behavior problems was stronger when parents were more religious. Implications of the moderating role of maternal religiosity on the association between harsh physical parenting and child behavioral problems are discussed.",Low-Carb and Ketogenic Diets in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035514,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"Low-carb and ketogenic diets are popular among clinicians and patients, but the appropriateness of reducing carbohydrates intake in obese patients and in patients with diabetes is still debated. Studies in the literature are indeed controversial, possibly because these diets are generally poorly defined; this, together with the intrinsic complexity of dietary interventions, makes it difficult to compare results from different studies. Despite the evidence that reducing carbohydrates intake lowers body weight and, in patients with type 2 diabetes, improves glucose control, few data are available about sustainability, safety and efficacy in the long-term. In this review we explored the possible role of low-carb and ketogenic diets in the pathogenesis and management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, we also reviewed evidence of carbohydrates restriction in both pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, through gut microbiota modification, and treatment of type 1 diabetes, addressing the legitimate concerns about the use of such diets in patients who are ketosis-prone and often have not completed their growth.",Chyawanprash: A Traditional Indian Bioactive Health Supplement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035513,Biomolecules,2019 04 30,"Chyawanprash (CP) is an Ayurvedic health supplement which is made up of a super-concentrated blend of nutrient-rich herbs and minerals. It is meant to restore drained reserves of life force (ojas) and to preserve strength, stamina, and vitality, while stalling the course of aging. Chyawanprash is formulated by processing around 50 medicinal herbs and their extracts, including the prime ingredient, Amla (Indian gooseberry), which is the world's richest source of vitamin C. Chyawanprash preparation involves preparing a decoction of herbs, followed by dried extract preparation, subsequent mixture with honey, and addition of aromatic herb powders (namely clove, cardamom, and cinnamon) as standard. The finished product has a fruit jam-like consistency, and a sweet, sour, and spicy flavor. Scientific exploration of CP is warranted to understand its therapeutic efficacy. Scattered information exploring the therapeutic potential of CP is available, and there is a need to assemble it. Thus, an effort was made to compile the scattered information from ancient Ayurvedic texts and treatises, along with ethnobotanical, ethnopharmacological, and scientifically validated literature, that highlight the role of CP in therapeutics.

In this systematic review, we provide an overview of clinical trials with stroma-targeting agents. We systematically searched MEDLINE/PubMed and the EMBASE database, using the PRISMA guidelines, for eligible clinical trials. In total, 2330 records were screened, from which we have included 106 articles. A meta-analysis could be performed on 51 articles which describe the targeting of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, and three articles which describe the targeting of hyaluronic acid. Anti-VEGF therapies did not show an increase in median overall survival (OS) with combined hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.13). Treatment with hyaluronidase PEGPH20 showed promising results, but, thus far, only in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in selected patients with hyaluronic acid (HA)high tumors: An increase in median progression free survival (PFS) of 2.9 months, as well as a HR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.26-1.00). In conclusion, we found that anti-angiogenic therapies did not show an increased benefit in median OS or PFS in contrast to promising results with anti-hyaluronic acid treatment in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The PEGPH20 clinical trials used patient selection to determine eligibility based on tumor biology, which underlines the importance to personalize treatment for pancreatic cancer patients.",Towards the Abandonment of Surgical Castration in Pigs: How is Immunocastration Perceived by Italian Consumers?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035511,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 30,"Immunocastration of pigs represents an alternative method to surgical castration, being more respectful of animal welfare. However, this new technology may not be accepted by consumers due to their perception of possible risks tied to the use of the product, thus representing a concern for the production sector. The study aimed at verifying the attitude of Italian consumers towards immunocastration and to assess whether their perception can be affected by science-based information on advantages and disadvantages of immunocastration. A total of 969 consumers (divided in three groups representative of the Italian population) were contacted and asked to complete an online questionnaire. Only technical (neutral) information on immunocastration was provided to the first group; the second and the third group received information on the advantages (+) and disadvantages (-) of the technique, shown in reverse order (+/- and -/+, respectively). The level of information did not affect consumers' perception of immunocastration. Overall, immunocastration is perceived in a predominantly positive manner (54.5%), with a relatively low level of risk perception (34.2%), and a good willingness to pay more for meat deriving from immunocastrated pigs (+18.7%).",Pinocembrin Protects from AGE-Induced Cytotoxicity and Inhibits Non-Enzymatic Glycation in Human Insulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035509,Cells,2019 04 30,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the end products of the glycation reaction and have a great importance in clinical science for their association with oxidative stress and inflammation, which play a major role in most chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Their pathogenic effects are generally induced by the interaction between AGEs and the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) on the cell surface, which triggers reactive oxygen species production, nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation, and inflammation. Pinocembrin, the most abundant flavonoid in propolis, has been recently proven to interfere with RAGE activation in Aβ-RAGE-induced toxicity. In the present study, we investigated the ability of pinocembrin to interfere with RAGE signaling pathways activated by AGEs. Interestingly, pinocembrin was able to inhibit oxidative stress and NF-kB activation in cells exposed to AGEs. In addition, it was able to block caspase 3/7 and 9 activation, thus suggesting an active role of this molecule in counteracting AGE-RAGE-induced toxicity mediated by NF-kB signaling pathways. The ability of pinocembrin to affect the glycation reaction has been also tested. Our data suggest that pinocembrin might be a promising molecule in protecting from AGE-mediated pathogenesis.",Prediction of Deflection of Reinforced Concrete Beams Strengthened with Fiber Reinforced Polymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035508,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The article analyses the calculation of the deflection of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with fiber reinforced polymer. This paper specifically focuses on estimating deflection when the yielding of reinforcement is reached. The article proposes a simple method for calculating deflection that was compared with the experimentally predicted deflection. The carried out comparison has showed that the proposed method is suitable not only for the strengthened beams but also for the reinforced concrete beams with a varying reinforcement ratio. The suggested calculation method is based on the effective moment of inertia, such as the one introduced in the ACI Committee 318 Building Code Requirement for Structural Concrete (ACI318). The development of deflection was divided into three stages, and equations for the effective moment of inertia were proposed considering separate stages. In addition, the put forward equations were modified attaching additional relative coefficients evaluating a change in the depth of the neutral axis.",Pterostilbene Reduces Liver Steatosis and Modifies Hepatic Fatty Acid Profile in Obese Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035507,Nutrients,2019 05 06,"Excessive fat accumulation within the liver is known as ""simple hepatic steatosis"", which is the most benign form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the present study was to determine whether pterostilbene improves this hepatic alteration in Zucker (fa/fa) rats. Animals were distributed in two experimental groups (n = 10) and fed a standard laboratory diet. Rats in the pterostilbene group were given a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight/d for six weeks. After sacrifice, serum glucose, transaminase, and insulin concentrations were quantified and the liver triacylglycerol content and fatty acid profile was analyzed. Different pathways of triacylglycerol metabolism in liver were studied, including fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, triglyceride assembly, fatty acid uptake, and glucose uptake. With pterostilbene administration, a reduction in insulin concentrations (consequently in the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)) and hepatic triacylglycerol content were observed. No effects were observed in pterostilbene-treated rats in the activity of de novo lipogenesis enzymes. An improvement in the fatty acid profile was observed in pterostilbene-treated rats. In conclusion, pterostilbene is a useful molecule to reduce liver steatosis. Its delipidating effect is due, at least in part, to reduced fatty acid availability and triacylglycerol synthesis, as well as to an increased very low-density lipoprotein assembly and fatty acid oxidation."

A fabrication process allowing the porosity of the foams to be adjusted was proposed and the fabricated foams were characterized. Then, elementary capacitive pressure sensors (15 × 15 mm2 square shaped electrodes) were elaborated with fabricated foams (5 mm or 10 mm thick) and were electromechanically characterized. Since the sensor responses under load are strongly non-linear, a behavioral non-linear model (first order exponential) was proposed, adjusted to the experimental data, and used to objectively estimate the sensor performances in terms of sensitivity and measurement range. The main conclusions of this study are that the porosity of the PDMS foams can be adjusted through the sugar:PDMS volume ratio and the size of sugar crystals used to fabricate the foams. Additionally, the porosity of the foams significantly modified the sensor performances. Indeed, compared to bulk PDMS sensors of the same size, the sensitivity of porous PDMS sensors could be multiplied by a factor up to 100 (the sensitivity is 0.14 %.kPa-1 for a bulk PDMS sensor and up to 13.7 %.kPa-1 for a porous PDMS sensor of the same dimensions), while the measurement range was reduced from a factor of 2 to 3 (from 594 kPa for a bulk PDMS sensor down to between 255 and 177 kPa for a PDMS foam sensor of the same dimensions, according to the porosity). This study opens the way to the design and fabrication of wearable flexible pressure sensors with adjustable performances through the control of the porosity of the fabricated PDMS foams.",Isolation and Characterization of Lactobacillus brevis Phages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035495,Viruses,2019 04 30,"Lactobacillus brevis has been widely used in industry for fermentation purposes. However, it is also associated with the spoilage of foods and beverages, in particular, beer. There is an increasing demand for natural food preservation methods, and in this context, bacteriophages possess the potential to control such spoilage bacteria. Just a few studies on phages infecting Lactobacillus brevis have been performed to date and in the present study, we report the isolation and characterization of five virulent phages capable of infecting Lb. brevis strains. The analysis reveals a high diversity among the isolates, with members belonging to both, the Myoviridae and Siphoviridae families. One isolate, designated phage 3-521, possesses a genome of 140.8 kb, thus representing the largest Lb. brevis phage genome sequenced to date. While the isolated phages do not propagate on Lb. brevis beer-spoiling strains, phages showed activity against these strains, impairing the growth of some Lb. brevis strains. The results highlight the potential of bacteriophage-based treatments as an effective approach to prevent bacterial spoilage of beer.","Optimization of Intrinsic ZnO Thickness in Cu(In,Ga)Se2-Based Thin Film Solar Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035494,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The typical structure of high efficiency Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS)-based thin film solar cells is substrate/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al(AZO) where the sun light comes through the transparent conducting oxide (i.e., i-ZnO/AZO) side. In this study, the thickness of an intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) layer was optimized by considering the surface roughness of CIGS light absorbers. The i-ZnO layers with different thicknesses from 30 to 170 nm were deposited via sputtering. The optical properties, microstructures, and morphologies of the i-ZnO thin films with different thicknesses were characterized, and their effects on the CIGS solar cell device properties were explored. Two types of CIGS absorbers prepared by three-stage co-evaporation and two-step sulfurization after the selenization (SAS) processes showed a difference in the preferred crystal orientation, morphology, and surface roughness. During the subsequent post-processing for the fabrication of the glass/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO device, the change in the i-ZnO thickness influenced the performance of the CIGS devices. For the three-stage co-evaporated CIGS cell, the increase in the thickness of the i-ZnO layer from 30 to 90 nm improved the shunt resistance (RSH), open circuit voltage, and fill factor (FF), as well as the conversion efficiency (10.1% to 11.8%). A further increas of the i-ZnO thickness to 170 nm, deteriorated the device performance parameters, which suggests that 90 nm is close to the optimum thickness of i-ZnO. Conversely, the device with a two-step SAS processed CIGS absorber showed smaller values of the overall RSH (130-371 Ω cm2) than that of the device with a three-stage co-evaporated CIGS absorber (530-1127 Ω cm2) ranging from 30 nm to 170 nm of i-ZnO thickness. Therefore, the value of the shunt resistance was monotonically increased with the i-ZnO thickness ranging from 30 to 170 nm, which improved the FF and conversion efficiency (6.96% to 8.87%).",Melanocortin-4 Receptor and Lipocalin 2 Gene Variants in Spanish Children with Abdominal Obesity: Effects on BMI-SDS After a Lifestyle Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035493,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"Mutations leading to a reduced function of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) exert a major gene effect on extreme obesity. Recently it was shown that the bone derived hormone lipocalin 2 (LCN2) binds to the MC4R and activates a MC4R dependent anorexigenic pathway. We identified mutations in both genes and screened the effects of MC4R and LCN2 mutations on eating behavior and weight change after a lifestyle intervention. One hundred and twelve children (11.24 ± 2.6 years, BMI-SDS 2.91 ± 1.07) with abdominal obesity participated in a lifestyle intervention. MC4R and LCN2 coding regions were screened by Sanger sequencing. Eating behavior was assessed at baseline with the Children Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ). We detected three previously described non-synonymous MC4R variants (Glu42Lys, Thr150Ile, and Arg305Gln) and one non-synonymous polymorphism (Ile251Leu). Regarding LCN2, one known non-synonymous variant (Thr124Met) was detected. Eating behavior was described in carriers of the MC4R and LCN2 mutation and in non-carriers. MC4R and LCN2 mutations were detected in 2.42% and 0.84%, respectively, of Spanish children with abdominal obesity. A number of subjects with functional mutation variants in MC4R and LCN2 were able to achieve a reduction in BMI-SDS after a lifestyle intervention.",Public Health Risks Associated with Tetrodotoxin and Its Analogues in European Waters: Recent Advances after The EFSA Scientific Opinion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035492,Toxins,2019 04 30,"Tetrodotoxin (TTX) and its analogues are naturally occurring toxins responsible worldwide for human intoxication cases and fatalities, mainly associated with pufferfish consumption. In the last decade, TTXs were detected in marine bivalves and gastropods from European waters. As TTXs are not regulated or monitored at EU level, their unexpected occurrence in shellfish raised concerns as a food safety hazard and revealed the necessity of a thorough assessment on the public health risks associated with their presence. For this reason, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was requested by the European Commission to provide a scientific opinion, finally adopted in March 2017, according to which a provisional concentration below 44 μg TTX equivalents/kg shellfish meat, based on a large portion size of 400 g, was considered not to result in adverse effects in humans. The EFSA expert panel, however, recognized a number of shortcomings and uncertainties related to the unavailability of sufficient scientific data and provided relevant recommendations for future research to overcome these data gaps identified in order to further refine the risk assessment on TTXs. The present review aims to summarize the knowledge obtained towards addressing these recommendations in the two years following publication of the EFSA opinion, at the same time highlighting the points requiring further investigation.",Protein Hydroxylation by Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) Hydroxylases: Unique or Ubiquitous?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035491,Cells,2019 04 30,"All metazoans that utilize molecular oxygen (O2) for metabolic purposes have the capacity to adapt to hypoxia, the condition that arises when O2 demand exceeds supply. This is mediated through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. At physiological oxygen levels (normoxia), HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate proline residues on HIF-α subunits leading to their destabilization by promoting ubiquitination by the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase and subsequent proteasomal degradation. HIF-α transactivation is also repressed in an O2-dependent way due to asparaginyl hydroxylation by the factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH). In hypoxia, the O2-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-α subunits by PHDs and FIH is reduced, resulting in HIF-α accumulation, dimerization with HIF-β and migration into the nucleus to induce an adaptive transcriptional response. Although HIFs are the canonical substrates for PHD- and FIH-mediated protein hydroxylation, increasing evidence indicates that these hydroxylases may also have alternative targets. In addition to PHD-conferred alterations in protein stability, there is now evidence that hydroxylation can affect protein activity and protein/protein interactions for alternative substrates. PHDs can be pharmacologically inhibited by a new class of drugs termed prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors which have recently been approved for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. The identification of alternative targets of HIF hydroxylases is important in order to fully elucidate the pharmacology of hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI). Despite significant technical advances, screening, detection and verification of alternative functional targets for PHDs and FIH remain challenging. In this review, we discuss recently proposed non-HIF targets for PHDs and FIH and provide an overview of the techniques used to identify these.","Phylogenetic, Molecular, and Functional Characterization of PpyCBF Proteins in Asian Pears (Pyrus pyrifolia).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035490,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"C-repeat binding factor/dehydration-responsive element (CBF/DRE) transcription factors (TFs) participate in a variety of adaptive mechanisms, and are involved in molecular signaling and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. In pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) and other rosaceous crops, the independent evolution of CBF subfamily members requires investigation to understand the possible divergent functions of these proteins. In this study, phylogenetic analysis divided six PpyCBFs from the Asian pear genome into three clades/subtypes, and collinearity and phylogenetic analyses suggested that PpyCBF3 was the mother CBF. All PpyCBFs were found to be highly expressed in response to low temperature, salt, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) as well as bud endodormancy, similar to PpyCORs (PpyCOR47, PpyCOR15A, PpyRD29A, and PpyKIN). Transcript levels of clade II PpyCBFs during low temperature and ABA treatments were higher than those of clades I and III. Ectopic expression of PpyCBF2 and PpyCBF3 in Arabidopsis enhanced its tolerance against abiotic stresses, especially to low temperature in the first case and salt and drought stresses in the latter, and resulted in lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant gene activities compared with the wild type. The increased expression of endogenous ABA-dependent and -independent genes during normal conditions in PpyCBF2- and PpyCBF3-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines suggested that PpyCBFs were involved in both ABA-dependent and -independent pathways. All PpyCBFs, especially the mother CBF, had high transactivation activities with 6XCCGAC binding elements. Luciferase and Y1H assays revealed the existence of phylogenetically and promoter-dependent conserved CBF-COR cascades in the pear. The presence of a previously identified CCGA binding site, combined with the results of mutagenesis of the CGACA binding site of the PpyCOR15A promoter, indicated that CGA was a core binding element of PpyCBFs. In conclusion, PpyCBF TFs might operate redundantly via both ABA-dependent and -independent pathways, and are strongly linked to abiotic stress signaling and responses in the Asian pear.","Multi-Omics Analyses Detail Metabolic Reprogramming in Lipids, Carnitines, and Use of Glycolytic Intermediates between Prostate Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma and Prostate Adenocarcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035489,Metabolites,2019 04 30,"As the most common cancer in men, prostate cancer is molecularly heterogeneous. Contributing to this heterogeneity are the poorly understood metabolic adaptations of the two main types of prostate cancer, i.e., adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC), the latter being more aggressive and lethal. Using transcriptomics, untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics profiling on LASCPC-01 (prostate SCNC) and LNCAP (prostate adenocarcinoma) cell lines, we found significant differences in the cellular phenotypes of the two cell lines. Gene set enrichment analysis on the transcriptomics data showed 62 gene sets were upregulated in LASCPC-01, while 112 gene sets were upregulated in LNCAP. ChemRICH analysis on metabolomics and lipidomics data revealed a total of 25 metabolite clusters were significantly different. LASCPC-01 exhibited a higher glycolytic activity and lower levels of triglycerides, while the LNCAP cell line showed increases in one-carbon metabolism as an exit route of glycolytic intermediates and a decrease in carnitine, a mitochondrial lipid transporter. Our findings pinpoint differences in prostate neuroendocrine carcinoma versus prostate adenocarcinoma that could lead to new therapeutic targets in each type.",Questioning the Safety of Calcidiol in Hemodialysis Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035488,Nutrients,2019 05 07,"Epidemiological studies have suggested a survival benefit for hemodialysis patients on paricalcitol or calcitriol, but nutritional vitamin D supplementation of patients already on vitamin D receptor (VDR) activators is controversial.",Gluten Vehicle and Placebo for Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035487,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 04 30,"Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations triggered after gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. Because of the lack of biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, the cornerstone for its assessment is a single- or double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge. However, there are some non-standardized points in the diagnostic approach proposed by the experts. This complicate comparisons among the results published by different research groups. The gluten vehicle and placebo must be indistinguishable from each other, which entails sensory and technological evaluations of the designed gluten vehicle and placebo products. At the moment, there is no standardized method for the preparation of the gluten vehicle and placebo for carrying out DBPC gluten challenges for NCGS assessment. This review focuses on the challenges that researchers have to face, either for the development of an accepted gluten vehicle and placebo or for identifying NCGS cases on the basis of DBPC gluten challenges."

Due to their outstanding material properties they can be used in a wide range of applications. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a metabolically versatile producer of mcl-polyhydroxyalkanoates. Although the metabolism of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis by this bacterium has been extensively studied, the comparative proteome analysis from three growth stages of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 cultured with oleic acid during mcl-PHA synthesis has not yet been reported. Therefore; the aim of the study was to compare the proteome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 at different time points of its cultivation using the 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technique. The analyses showed that low levels of a nitrogen source were beneficial for mcl-PHA synthesis. Proteomic analysis revealed that the proteins associated with carbon metabolism were affected by nitrogen starvation and mcl-PHA synthesis. Furthermore, the induction of proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, ribosome synthesis, and transport was observed, which may be the cellular response to stress related to nitrogen deficiency and mcl-PHA content in bacterial cells. To sum up; this study enabled the investigators to acquire a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis and accumulation in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 that could lead to improved strategies for PHAs in industrial production.","Effect of Tomato Nutrient Complex on Blood Pressure: A Double Blind, Randomized Dose⁻Response Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035474,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Tomato carotenoids such as lycopene and the colorless carotenoids phytoene and phytofluene induce the antioxidant defense mechanism. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study aimed to find effective doses of Tomato Nutrient Complex (TNC) to maintain normal blood pressure in untreated hypertensive individuals. The effect of TNC treatment (5, 15 and 30 mg lycopene) was compared with 15 mg of synthetic lycopene and a placebo over eight weeks. Results indicate that only TNC treatment standardized for 15 or 30 mg of lycopene was associated with significant reductions in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP). Treatment with the lower dose standardized for 5 mg of lycopene or treatment with 15 mg of synthetic lycopene as a standalone had no significant effect. To test carotenoid bioavailability, volunteers were treated for four weeks with TNC providing 2, 5 or 15 mg lycopene. The increase in blood levels of lycopene, phytoene, and phytofluene was dose dependent. Results suggest that only carotenoid levels achieved by the TNC dose of 15 mg lycopene or higher correlate to a beneficial effect on SBP in hypertensive subjects while lower doses and lycopene alone do not.",Using the Avocado to Test the Satiety Effects of a Fat-Fiber Combination in Place of Carbohydrate Energy in a Breakfast Meal in Overweight and Obese Men and Women: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035472,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"This study aimed to investigate the satiety effects of isocalorically replacing carbohydrate energy in a meal with avocado-derived fats and fibers. In a randomized 3-arm, 6-h, crossover clinical trial, thirty-one overweight/obese adults consumed a low-fat control meal (CON, 76% carbohydrate, 14% fat as energy, 5 g fiber, ~640 kcal) or high-fat meals similar in total fat and energy, but increasing avocado-derived fat and fiber content from half (HA, 68 g; 51% carbohydrate, 40% fat as energy, 8.6 g fiber) or whole avocado (WA, 136 g; 50% carbohydrate, 43% fat as energy, 13.1 g fiber) on three separate occasions. Visual analog scales (VAS) assessed subjective satiety over 6 h. Hormones associated with satiety/appetite were measured in blood collected immediately after VAS. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationship of VAS with hormones in WA and CON. Hunger suppression was enhanced after the WA compared to CON meal (p < 0.01). Subjects indicated feeling more satisfied after both HA and WA than CON (p < 0.05). Fullness was greater after CON and WA vs. HA (p < 0.005). PYY and GLP-1 were significantly elevated after WA vs. CON (p < 0.05), while insulin was significantly higher after CON vs. WA (p < 0.0001). Ghrelin was suppressed more by CON than WA (p < 0.05). Regression analysis indicated PYY was associated with subjective satiety after WA, whereas increased insulin predicted changes in subjective satiety after CON. Replacing carbohydrates in a high-carbohydrate meal with avocado-derived fat-fiber combination increased feelings of satiety mediated primarily by PYY vs. insulin. These findings may have important implications for addressing appetite management and metabolic concerns.",The Effects of High Peripubertal Caffeine Exposure on the Adrenal Gland in Immature Male and Female Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035471,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"The consumption of high levels of dietary caffeine has increased in children and adolescents. Human and animal studies have shown that chronic intake of high doses of caffeine affects serum glucocorticoid levels. Given that glucocorticoids play a role in peripubertal organ growth and development, chronic high doses of caffeine during puberty might impair maturation of the adrenal glands. To evaluate any effects of caffeine exposure on growing adrenal glands, 22-day-old male (n = 30) and female Sprague Dawley rats (n = 30) were divided into three groups (n = 10/group); group 1 received tap water (control) and groups 2 and 3 received water containing 120 and 180 mg/kg/day caffeine, respectively, via gavage for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, adrenal glands were weighed and processed for histological analysis. Relative adrenal weights increased in both groups of caffeine-fed males and females, whereas absolute weights were decreased in the females. In the female caffeine-fed groups the adrenal cortical areas resembled irregularly arranged cords and the medullary area was significantly increased, whereas no such effects were seen in the male rats. Our results indicate that the harmful effects of caffeine on the adrenal glands of immature rats differ between females and males. Although female rats seemed to be more susceptible to damage based on the changes in the microarchitecture of the adrenal glands, caffeine affected corticosterone production in both female and male rats. In addition, increased basal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels in caffeine-fed groups may reflect decreased cortical function. Therefore, caffeine may induce an endocrine imbalance that disturbs the establishment of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis during puberty, thereby leading to abnormal stress responses.",Implication of Ventricular Assist Devices in Extracorporeal Membranous Oxygenation Patients Listed for Heart Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035470,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"The new allocation criteria classify patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as the highest priority for receiving orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) especially if they are considered not candidates for ventricular assist devices. The outcomes of patients who receive ventricular assist devices (VADs) after being listed for heart transplantation with VA-ECMO is unknown. We analyzed 355 patients listed for OHT with VA-ECMO from the United Network for Organ Sharing database from 2006 to 2014. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models were used to determine the contribution of prognostic variables to the outcome. Thirty-three patients (9.3%) received VADs (15 dischargeable, 7 non-dischargeable VADs). The VAD and non-VAD groups had similar listing characteristics except that the VAD group were more likely to have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (48.5% vs. 25.2%), and less likely to be obese (6.1% vs. 25.2%) or have a history of prior organ transplant (3% vs. 31.1%). Patients who underwent VAD implantation had more days on the list (median 189 vs. 14 days) compared to the non-VAD group. Amongst the patients who had VADs, (25/33) 75.5% patients were subsequently transplanted with similar post-transplant survival compared to the non-VAD group (72% vs. 60.5%; p = 0.276). Predictors of one-year post-transplant mortality included panel reactive antibodies (PRA) class I ≥ 20%, recipient smoking history, increased serum creatinine and total bilirubin. Therefore, a small proportion of patients listed for transplantation with VA ECMO undergo VAD implantation. Their waitlist survival is better than non-VAD group but with similar post-transplant survival.",Effects of a Novel Nutraceutical Combination (Aquilea Colesterol®) on the Lipid Profile and Inflammatory Biomarkers: A Randomized Control Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035469,Nutrients,2019 04 30,Cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals are useful in the management of moderate hypercholesterolemia.,Carbon-Doped TiO2 Activated by X-Ray Irradiation for the Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy in Tumor Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035468,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by the penetration depth of visible light. Although the light source has been changed to near infrared, infrared light is unable to overcome the penetration barrier and it is only effective at the surface of the tumors. In this study, we used X-ray as a light source for deep-seated tumor treatment. A particle with a narrow band gap when exposed to soft X-rays would produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill tumor cell, with less damage to the normal tissues. Anatase TiO2 has been studied as a photosensitizer in PDT. In the experiment, C was doped into the anatase lattice at an optimum atomic ratio to make the band gap narrower, which would be activated by X-ray to produce more ROS and kill tumor cells under stress. The results showed that the synthesized TiO2:C particles were identified as crystal structures of anatase. The synthesized particles could be activated effectively by soft X-rays to produce ROS, to degrade methylene blue by up to 30.4%. Once TiO2:C was activated by X-ray irradiation, the death rate of A549 cells in in vitro testing was as high as 16.57%, on day 2. In the animal study, the tumor size gradually decreased after treatment with TiO2:C and exposure to X-rays on day 0 and day 8. On day 14, the tumor declined to nearly half of its initial volume, while the tumor in the control group was twice its initial volume. After the animal was sacrificed, blood, and major organs were harvested for further analysis and examination, with data fully supporting the safety of the treatment. Based on the results of the study, we believe that TiO2:C when exposed to X-rays could overcome the limitation of penetration depth and could improve PDT effects by inhibiting tumor growth effectively and safely, in vivo.",Gene Regulation Mediated by microRNA-Triggered Secondary Small RNAs in Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035467,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"In plants, proper development and response to abiotic and biotic stimuli requires an orchestrated regulation of gene expression. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are key molecules involved in this process, leading to downregulation of their target genes. Two main classes of sRNAs exist, the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). The role of the latter class in plant development and physiology is well known, with many examples of how miRNAs directly impact the expression of genes in cells where they are produced, with dramatic consequences to the life of the plant. However, there is an aspect of miRNA biology that is still poorly understood. In some cases, miRNA targeting can lead to the production of secondary siRNAs from its target. These siRNAs, which display a characteristic phased production pattern, can act in cis, reinforcing the initial silencing signal set by the triggering miRNA, or in trans, affecting genes that are unrelated to the initial target. In this review, the mechanisms and implications of this process in the gene regulation mediated by miRNAs will be discussed. This work will also explore techniques for gene silencing in plants that are based on this unique pathway.",Propofol Requirement in Patients with Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Tumors Undergoing Transsphenoidal Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035466,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"Growth hormone (GH) secretion is regulated by various hormones or neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid.

The effect-site concentrations were recorded at both a loss of consciousness and a bispectral index (BIS) of 40, along with the effect-site concentration after extubation, during emergence from the anesthesia. The effect-site concentration of propofol was higher in the GH group than in the NF group at a loss of consciousness and a BIS of 40 (4.09 ± 0.81 vs. 3.58 ± 0.67, p = 0.009 and 6.23 ± 1.29 vs. 5.50 ± 1.13, p = 0.025, respectively) and immediately after extubation (1.60 ± 0.27 vs. 1.40 ± 0.41, p = 0.046).

The rising incidence of IBD has been associated with urbanization and shifts toward a Westernized diet. The intestinal microbiome has been a focus of disease pathogenesis and also therapeutic intervention. Dietary therapy for IBD has been well-studied with exclusive enteral nutrition, a formula-based diet with the exclusion of foods. In addition, interest in food-based exclusion diets has been increasing, with patients and families leading the charge. Challenges with dietary therapy for IBD include the lack of understanding of a detailed mechanistic pathway to explain the impact of diet on IBD pathogenesis and the difficult nature of designing and implementing dietary clinical trials. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations and intervention studies have demonstrated efficacy, but specific dietary targets remain as hypotheses at present. Current IBD therapy focuses on suppression of the immune system, yet the incomplete efficacy of present drugs suggests that other therapies must be developed and employed. Dietary interventions, with known ability to modulate the intestinal microbiome, are a unique opportunity to improve outcomes in IBD. Dietary intervention trials are challenging, and capturing both broad dietary patterns as well as exposure to individual food compounds is important. With increasing patient interest and preliminary research in dietary therapy indicating efficacy, it is imperative to further advance the science of utilizing diet in IBD, as well as to support patients by proactively addressing diet within their care plan."

Resveratrol can play a beneficial role in the prevention and in the progression of chronic diseases related to inflammation such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancers among other conditions. Moreover, resveratrol regulates immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. At the molecular level, it targets sirtuin, adenosine monophosphate kinase, nuclear factor-κB, inflammatory cytokines, anti-oxidant enzymes along with cellular processes such as gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Resveratrol can suppress the toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. The antioxidant activity of resveratrol and the ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute to its anti-inflammation properties. The effects of this biologically active compound on the immune system are associated with widespread health benefits for different autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. This review offers a systematic understanding of how resveratrol targets multiple inflammatory components and exerts immune-regulatory effects on immune cells.",An Integrated Approach to Current Trends in Organic Food in the EU.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035453,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The objective of this paper is to summarize an extensive bibliographical search by presenting the retrospective of EU organic food from the point of regulation, policy framework, trends and challenges. We also make a critical review of existing scientific evidence regarding European trends in organic food consumption and production and we identify research gaps for future comprehensive assessments of the policy and legal framework. This review has indicated the importance of the two pillars, namely regulation and policy, highlighting not only the need for solid restrictions regarding organic food production, however also the need to support food safety and consumer confidence in the growing organic food market.",Marine Rare Actinomycetes: A Promising Source of Structurally Diverse and Unique Novel Natural Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035452,Marine drugs,2019 04 30,"Rare actinomycetes are prolific in the marine environment; however, knowledge about their diversity, distribution and biochemistry is limited. Marine rare actinomycetes represent a rather untapped source of chemically diverse secondary metabolites and novel bioactive compounds. In this review, we aim to summarize the present knowledge on the isolation, diversity, distribution and natural product discovery of marine rare actinomycetes reported from mid-2013 to 2017. A total of 97 new species, representing 9 novel genera and belonging to 27 families of marine rare actinomycetes have been reported, with the highest numbers of novel isolates from the families Pseudonocardiaceae, Demequinaceae, Micromonosporaceae and Nocardioidaceae. Additionally, this study reviewed 167 new bioactive compounds produced by 58 different rare actinomycete species representing 24 genera. Most of the compounds produced by the marine rare actinomycetes present antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, anticancer or antimalarial activities. The highest numbers of natural products were derived from the genera Nocardiopsis, Micromonospora, Salinispora and Pseudonocardia. Members of the genus Micromonospora were revealed to be the richest source of chemically diverse and unique bioactive natural products.",Pain in Advanced Stages of Dementia: The Perspective of Medical Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035451,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 04 30,"Background and objective: The number of studies related to medical students' attitude toward pain is limited. The aim of our study was, thus, to assess the medical students' knowledge of pain assessment and treatment in advanced stages of dementia in order to improve the existing curriculum in this area. Material and methods: We analyzed the medical students' knowledge about pain in advanced dementia based on a short questionnaire. The research was anonymous. The questionnaire was completed by 147 students. Results: The students most often suggested that pain in patients with advanced dementia could be manifested via body language and facial expression (107 students-72.8% and 100 students-68.0%, respectively). Vocalization was the third most frequently reported pain manifestation (84-57.1%). Other groups of pain symptoms (changes in activity patterns, changes in interpersonal interactions, and mental status changes) were indicated less often (p < 0.0001). Only five students (3.4%) listed the DOLOPLUS behavioral pain scale as an assessment tool for patients with advanced dementia, and 16 (10.9%) indicated observational scale elements or a necessity to observe the patient. Still, 110 students (74.5%) correctly characterized pain treatment in patients with advanced dementia. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, our study is pioneering in defining the deficits of medical students' knowledge on pain assessment and treatment in patients with advanced dementia. We highlighted knowledge gaps in the area of pain assessment which might make medical students incapable of proper pain treatment. Following the International Association for the Study of Pain considerations regarding the need for excellence in pain education, these results can contribute to the improvement of existing medical curricula in Poznan University of Medical Sciences to include pain management in dementia in a more ""patient-centered"" way in order to increase future staff's competency and to assure a better quality of care.",A Fourier-Based Image Formation Algorithm for Geo-Stationary GNSS-Based Bistatic Forward-Looking Synthetic Aperture Radar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035450,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"A Geo-Stationary GNSS-based Bistatic Forward-Looking Synthetic Aperture Radar (GeoSta-GNSS-BFLSAR) system is a particular kind of passive bistatic SAR system. In this system, a geo-stationary GNSS is used as the transmitter, while the receiver is deployed on a moving aircraft, which travels towards a target in a straight line. It is expected that such a radar system has potential for self-landing, self-navigation and battlefield information acquisition applications, etc. Up to now, little information from a research perspective can be found about GeoSta-GNSS-BFLSAR systems. To address this information gap, this paper proposes a preliminary image formation algorithm for GeoSta-GNSS-BFLSAR. The full details of the mathematical derivation are given. It is highlighted that, to overcome the long dwell time and spatial variance of GeoSta-GNSS-BFLSAR, a modified migration correction factor must be designed. In addition, the system performances and technical limitations of GeoSta-GNSS-BFLSAR such as focusing depth and spatial resolution are analytically discussed. In the end, a set of simulations including the image formation algorithm, focusing depth and spatial resolution were conducted for verification. It is demonstrated that the focusing performances of the proposed algorithm have a high level of similarity with the theoretical counterparts. This article thus proves the feasibility of GeoSta-GNSS-BFLSAR systems from a simulation level and establishes a foundation for the real applications of such a radar scheme in the future.",Three-Dimensional Nano-Morphology of Carbon Nanotube/Epoxy Filled Poly(methyl methacrylate) Microcapsules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035448,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The three-dimensional nano-morphology of poly(methyl methacrylate; PMMA) microcapsules filled with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and epoxy resin were investigated by various microscopy methods, including a novel, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) method. Initially, PMMA microcapsules containing various amounts of CNTs were synthesized by a solvent evaporation method. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that pore-free, smooth-surface microcapsules formed with various types of core-shell morphologies. The average size of CNT/epoxy/PMMA microcapsules was shown to decrease from ~52 μm to ~15 μm when mixing speed during synthesis increased from 300 rpm to 1000 rpm. In general, the presence of CNTs resulted in slightly larger microcapsules and higher variations in size. Moreover, three-dimensional scans obtained from confocal microscopy revealed that higher CNT content increased the occurrence and size of CNT aggregates inside the microcapsules. Entrapped submicron air bubbles were also observed inside most microcapsules, particularly within those with higher CNT content.","MicroRNA in Ovarian Cancer: Biology, Pathogenesis, and Therapeutic Opportunities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035447,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Ovarian cancer comprises one of the three major malignant tumor types in the female reproductive system. The mortality rate of this cancer is the highest among all gynecological tumors, with ovarian cancer metastasis constituting an important cause of death. Therefore, markers for disease prediction and prognosis are highly desirable for early diagnosis as well as for helping optimize and personalize treatment. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), which consist of short-sequence RNAs that do not encode a protein, have emerged as new biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. By pairing with bases specific to the target messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs cause degradation of the target mRNA or inhibit its translation, thereby regulating various cellular processes including cell proliferation and adhesion. Increasing numbers of studies have shown that miRNA expression abnormality plays an important role in the development of ovarian cancer. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of miRNA action, current research regarding their role in the suppression or promotion of ovarian cancer, and their use as markers for diagnosis of prognosis or as therapeutic targets for this disease. Finally, we present future perspectives regarding the clinical management of ovarian cancer and the role for miRNAs therein.",Application of Acyzol in the Context of Zinc Deficiency and Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035445,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Zinc is one of the most important essential trace elements. It is involved in more than 300 enzyme systems and is an indispensable participant in many biochemical processes. Zinc deficiency causes a number of disorders in the human body, the main ones being the delay of growth and puberty, immune disorders, and cognitive dysfunctions. There are over two billion people in the world suffering from zinc deficiency conditions. Acyzol, a zinc-containing medicine, developed as an antidote against carbon monoxide poisoning, demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological activities: Anti-inflammatory, reparative, detoxifying, immunomodulatory, bacteriostatic, hepatoprotective, adaptogenic, antioxidant, antihypoxic, and cardioprotective. The presence of zinc in the composition of Acyzol suggests the potential of the drug in the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency conditions, such as Prasad's disease, immune system pathology, alopecia, allergodermatoses, prostate dysfunction, psoriasis, stomatitis, periodontitis, and delayed mental and physical development in children. Currently, the efficiency of Acyzol in the cases of zinc deficiency is shown in a large number of experimental studies. So, Acyzol can be used as a highly effective drug for pharmacologic therapy of a wide range of diseases and conditions and it opens up new perspectives in the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency conditions.","The Nature and Cost of Readmissions after Work-Related Traumatic Spinal Injuries in New South Wales, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035444,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"This study aimed to measure the subsequent health and health service cost burden of a cohort of workers hospitalised after sustaining work-related traumatic spinal injuries (TSI) across New South Wales, Australia. A record-linkage study (June 2013-June 2016) of hospitalised cases of work-related spinal injury (ICD10-AM code U73.0 or workers compensation) was conducted. Of the 824 individuals injured during this time, 740 had sufficient follow-up data to analyse readmissions ≤90 days post-acute hospital discharge. Individuals with TSI were predominantly male (86.2%), mean age 46.6 years. Around 8% (n = 61) experienced 119 unplanned readmission episodes within 28 days from discharge, over half with the primary diagnosis being for care involving rehabilitation. Other readmissions involved device complications/infections (7.5%), genitourinary or respiratory infections (10%) or mental health needs (4.3%). The mean ± SD readmission cost was $6946 ± $14,532 per patient. Unplanned readmissions shortly post-discharge for TSI indicate unresolved issues within acute-care, or poor support services organisation in discharge planning. This study offers evidence of unmet needs after acute TSI and can assist trauma care-coordinators' comprehensive assessments of these patients prior to discharge. Improved quantification of the ongoing personal and health service after work-related injury is a vital part of the information needed to improve recovery after major work-related trauma.","Mutation of Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase6 Impairs Plant Growth and Phytic Acid Synthesis in Rice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035443,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (ITPK) is encoded by six genes in rice (OsITPK1-6). A previous study had shown that nucleotide substitutions of OsITPK6 could significantly lower the phytic acid content in rice grains. In the present study, the possibility of establishing a genome editing-based method for breeding low-phytic acid cultivars in rice was explored, in conjunction with the functional determination of OsITPK6. Four OsITPK6 mutant lines were generated by targeted mutagenesis of the gene's first exon using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, one (ositpk6_1) with a 6-bp in-frame deletion, and other three with frameshift mutations (ositpk6_2, _3, and _4). The frameshift mutations severely impaired plant growth and reproduction, while the effect of ositpk6_1 was relatively limited. The mutant lines ositpk6_1 and _2 had significantly lower levels (-10.1% and -32.1%) of phytic acid and higher levels (4.12- and 5.18-fold) of inorganic phosphorus compared with the wild-type (WT) line. The line ositpk6_1 also showed less tolerance to osmotic stresses. Our research demonstrates that mutations of OsITPK6, while effectively reducing phytic acid biosynthesis in rice grain, could significantly impair plant growth and reproduction."

(Apiaceae) is an endemic shrub from Chile commonly used as infusion in traditional medicine to treat diabetes, bronchial and intestinal disorders and stomach ailments, including ulcers. From the EtOAc extract of this plant, the new mulinane-type diterpenoids 3 and 5 were isolated along with three known diterpenoids. The gastroprotective effect of the infusion of the plant was assayed to support the traditional use and a fast HPLC analysis using high resolution techniques was performed to identify the bioactive constituents. The EtOAc extract and the edible infusion showed gastroprotective effect at 100 mg/kg in the HCl/EtOH induced gastric ulcer model in mice, reducing lesions by 33% and 74%, respectively. Finally, a metabolomic profiling based on UHPLC-ESI-MS/HRMS of the edible infusion was performed and thirty-five compounds were tentatively identified including quercetin, caffeic acid, apigenine glucoside, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acids, and caffeoylquinic acids, which have been associated previously with gastroprotective and antiulcer properties. This scientific evidence can support the contribution of polyphenols in the gastroprotective activity of the edible infusion of this plant, and can validate at least in part, its ethnopharmacological use.",Impacts of Low Atmospheric Pressure on Properties of Cement Concrete in Plateau Areas: A Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035426,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Low atmospheric pressure (LAP) can enormously affect properties of cement concrete in plateau areas. There are fewer studies and attendances on this issue than those of cement concrete in normal atmospheric pressure (AP), because of the limitations of both environmental conditions and instruments. In order to improve properties of cement concrete under LAP, influences of LAP on properties of cement concrete were reviewed in this work. The influence rules and mechanism on properties of cement concrete were summarized. The corresponding mechanism and techniques were put forward for enhancing the properties of cement concrete. The results of researchers show that LAP can significantly reduce the air entraining ability of the air entraining agent (AEA). Air content in concrete linearly decreases with the decrease of AP when other conditions are constant. If the initial air content is high, the decrease rate of air content increases with the decrease of AP. When the initial air content in cement concretes is similar, the greater the slump of cement concrete, the stronger its resistance to the decrease of air content caused by the decrease of AP. In addition, the condition of the bubble characteristics of hardened cement concrete under LAP is worse than that under normal AP. Therefore, the change of concrete properties under LAP is mainly attributed to these bubble characteristics, such as air content, bubble spacing coefficient, bubble radius and bubble specific surface area. In this work, nano-silica (negative charges) with cationic oligomeric surfactants is recommended as a new type of AEA to optimize the bubble characteristics under LAP in plateau areas.",Cervical Cancer Correlates with the Differential Expression of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors and Reveals Therapeutic Targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035425,Marine drugs,2019 04 30,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are associated with various cancers, but the relation between nAChRs and cervical cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the differential expression of nAChR subunits in human cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, HeLa, and CaSki) and in normal ectocervical cell lines (Ect1/E6E7) at mRNA and protein levels. Two specific nAChR subtype blockers, αO-conotoxin GeXIVA and α-conotoxin TxID, were then selected to treat different human cervical cancer cell lines with specific nAChR subtype overexpression. The results showed that α3, α9, α10, and β4 nAChR subunits were overexpressed in SiHa cells compared with that in normal cells. α9 and α10 nAChR subunits were overexpressed in CaSki cells. α*-conotoxins that targeted either α9α10 or α3β4 nAChR were able to significantly inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation. These findings may provide a basis for new targets for cervical cancer targeted therapy.",Mulberry Extract Attenuates Endothelial Dysfunction through the Regulation of Uncoupling Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase in High Fat Diet Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035424,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"Dyslipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction, which is linked to nitric oxide (NO) biology. The coupling of endothelial NO synthase with cofactors is a major step for NO release. This study is aimed to investigate the vascular pharmacology effects of mulberry in rat thoracic aorta and human vascular endothelial cells. In vitro, we investigated the protective effects of the mulberry extract and its main component cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C-3-R), against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling. Whereas ox-LDL significantly decreased NO levels in endothelial cells, mulberry extract, and C-3-R significantly recovered NO levels and phospho-eNOS Thr495 and Ser1177 expression. In vivo, mulberry was administered to 60% of high-fat diet (w/w)-fed Sprague Dawley (SD) rats for six weeks, in which endothelium-dependent relaxations were significantly improved in organ bath studies and isometric tension recordings. Consistently, aortic expressions of phospho-eNOS and nitrotyrosine were increased. Mulberry also raised serum NO levels, increased phosphorylation of eNOS, and reduced nitrotyrosine and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aortas, showing that mulberry preserves endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortas from high-fat diet rats. We suggest that this effect is mediated through enhanced NO bioavailability, in which the regulation of ROS and its reduced eNOS uncoupling are involved.",A Review on Sulfonated Polymer Composite/Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Membranes to Address Methanol Barrier Issue for Methanol Fuel Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035423,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"This paper focuses on a literature analysis and review of sulfonated polymer (s-Poly) composites, sulfonated organic, inorganic, and organic-inorganic hybrid membranes for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEM) systems, particularly for methanol fuel cell applications.

However, its metabolism rate is highly variable. A fast Tac metabolism rate, defined by the Tac blood trough concentration (C) divided by the daily dose (D), is associated with inferior renal function after RTx. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Tac metabolism rate impacts patient and graft survival after RTx. We analyzed all patients who received a RTx between January 2007 and December 2012 and were initially treated with an immunosuppressive regimen containing Tac (Prograf®), mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone and induction therapy. Patients with a Tac C/D ratio <1.05 ng/mL × 1/mg at three months after RTx were characterized as fast metabolizers and those with a C/D ratio ≥1.05 ng/mL×1/mg as slow metabolizers. Five-year patient and overall graft survival were noticeably reduced in fast metabolizers. Further, fast metabolizers showed a faster decline of eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) within five years after RTx and a higher rejection rate compared to slow metabolizers. Calculation of the Tac C/D ratio three months after RTx may assist physicians in their daily clinical routine to identify Tac-treated patients at risk for the development of inferior graft function, acute rejections, or even higher mortality.",Transcriptome Changes in the Mink Uterus during Blastocyst Dormancy and Reactivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035421,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Embryo implantation in the mink follows the pattern of many carnivores, in that preimplantation embryo diapause occurs in every gestation. Details of the gene expression and regulatory networks that terminate embryo diapause remain poorly understood. Illumina RNA-Seq was used to analyze global gene expression changes in the mink uterus during embryo diapause and activation leading to implantation. More than 50 million high quality reads were generated, and assembled into 170,984 unigenes. A total of 1684 differential expressed genes (DEGs) in uteri with blastocysts in diapause were compared to the activated embryo group (p < 0.05). Among these transcripts, 1527 were annotated as known genes, including 963 up-regulated and 564 down-regulated genes. The gene ontology terms for the observed DEGs, included cellular communication, phosphatase activity, extracellular matrix and G-protein couple receptor activity. The KEGG pathways, including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions were the most enriched. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and hub nodes such as VEGFA, EGF, AKT, IGF1, PIK3C and CCND1 with high degrees of connectivity represent gene clusters expected to play an important role in embryo activation.

MC simulations of complex thermal heating and electro-thermal degradation models can be employed for this analysis, but uncertainties need to be considered in the simulations, to produce accurate RUL expectation values and confidence margins for the results. The process requires performing large simulation sets, based on past temperature or load measurements and future load predictions. FPGA permit accelerating simulations for live analysis, but the thermal models involved are complex to be directly implemented in hardware logic. A new standalone FPGA architecture has been proposed for the fast and on-site degradation and reliability analysis of underground cables, based on MC simulation, and the effect of load uncertainties on the predicted cable EOL has been analyzed from the results.",Comparative Analysis of Different Tube Models for Linear Rheology of Monodisperse Linear Entangled Polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035419,Polymers,2019 04 30,"The aim of the present paper is to analyse the differences between tube-based models which are widely used for predicting the linear viscoelasticity of monodisperse linear polymers, in comparison to a large set of experimental data. The following models are examined: Milner-McLeish, Likhtman-McLeish, the Hierarchical model proposed by the group of Larson, the BoB model of Das and Read, and the TMA model proposed by the group of van Ruymbeke. This comparison allows us to highlight and discuss important questions related to the relaxation of entangled polymers, such as the importance of the contour-length fluctuations (CLF) process and how it affects the reptation mechanism, or the contribution of the constraint release (CR) process on the motion of the chains. In particular, it allows us to point out important approximations, inherent in some models, which result in an overestimation of the effect of CLF on the reptation time. On the contrary, by validating the TMA model against experimental data, we show that this effect is underestimated in TMA. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate predictions, a novel modification to the TMA model is proposed. Our current work is a continuation of earlier research (Shchetnikava et al., 2014), where a similar analysis is performed on well-defined star polymers."

It has a dismal prognosis, with most patients dying within one year when treated by conventional chemotherapies. The diagnosis is challenging, since neoplastic cells can resemble lymphoblasts or small immunoblasts, and require the use of a large panel of antibodies, including those against CD4, CD56, CD123, CD303, TCL1, and TCF4. The morphologic and in part phenotypic ambiguity explains the uncertainties as to the histogenesis of the neoplasm that led to the use of various denominations. Recently, a series of molecular studies based on karyotyping, gene expression profiling, and next generation sequencing, have largely unveiled the pathobiology of the tumour and proposed the potentially beneficial use of new drugs.

The lab-made fiber was prepared using a graphene oxide (G), carbon nanotubes (C), and titanium dioxide (T) composite, namely GCT, with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as supporting material. The detected antibiotics were enrofloxacin, sulfathiazole, erythromycin, and trimethoprim. The custom-made fiber was found to be superior compared with a commercial C18 fiber. The excellent reproducibility and lower intra-fiber relative standard deviations (RSDs 1.8% to 6.8%) and inter-fiber RSDs (4.5% to 8.8%) made it an ideal candidate for the detection of traces of antibiotics in real environmental samples. The proposed validated method provides a satisfactory limit of detection and good linear ranges with higher (>0.99) coefficient of determination in the aqueous system. Application of the method was made in different real water systems such as river, pond and tap water using the standard spiking method. Excellent sensitivity, reproducibility, lower amount of sample detection and higher recovery was found in a real water sample. Therefore, the extraction method was successfully applied to the detection and quantification of multiple classes of antibiotics in different aqueous systems with satisfactory results.","A Novel Method for Classifying Liver and Brain Tumors Using Convolutional Neural Networks, Discrete Wavelet Transform and Long Short-Term Memory Networks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035406,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Rapid classification of tumors that are detected in the medical images is of great importance in the early diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, a new liver and brain tumor classification method is proposed by using the power of convolutional neural network (CNN) in feature extraction, the power of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in signal processing, and the power of long short-term memory (LSTM) in signal classification. A CNN-DWT-LSTM method is proposed to classify the computed tomography (CT) images of livers with tumors and to classify the magnetic resonance (MR) images of brains with tumors. The proposed method classifies liver tumors images as benign or malignant and then classifies brain tumor images as meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. In the hybrid CNN-DWT-LSTM method, the feature vector of the images is obtained from pre-trained AlexNet CNN architecture. The feature vector is reduced but strengthened by applying the single-level one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (1-D DWT), and it is classified by training with an LSTM network. Under the scope of the study, images of 56 benign and 56 malignant liver tumors that were obtained from Fırat University Research Hospital were used and a publicly available brain tumor dataset were used. The experimental results show that the proposed method had higher performance than classifiers, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). By using the CNN-DWT-LSTM hybrid method, an accuracy rate of 99.1% was achieved in the liver tumor classification and accuracy rate of 98.6% was achieved in the brain tumor classification. We used two different datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Performance measurements show that the proposed method has a satisfactory accuracy rate at the liver tumor and brain tumor classifying.",Nickel-Catalyzed Decarbonylative Stannylation of Acyl Fluorides under Ligand-Free Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035405,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Nickel-catalyzed decarbonylative stannylation of acyl fluorides under ligand-free conditions was disclosed. A variety of aromatic acyl fluorides are capable of reacting with silylstannanes in the presence of cesium fluoride. A one-pot decarbonylative stannylation/Migita-Kosugi-Stille reaction of benzoyl fluoride, giving rise to the direct formation of the corresponding cross-coupled products, further demonstrated the synthetic utility of the present method. This newly developed methodology with a good functional-group compatibility via C-F bond cleavage and C-Sn bond formation under nickel catalysis opens a new area for the functionalization of acyl fluorides in terms of carbon-heteroatom bond formation.","Design, Synthesis, and Mechanism of Dihydroartemisinin⁻Coumarin Hybrids as Potential Anti-Neuroinflammatory Agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035404,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Cancer patients frequently suffer from cancer-related fatigue (CRF), which is a complex syndrome associated with weakness and depressed mood. Neuroinflammation is one of the major inducers of CRF. The aim of this study is to find a potential agent not only on the treatment of cancer, but also for reducing CRF level of cancer patients. In this study, total-thirty new Dihydroartemisinin-Coumarin hybrids (DCH) were designed and synthesized. The in vitro cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines (HT-29, MDA-MB-231, HCT-116, and A549) was evaluated. Simultaneously, we also tested the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of DCH. DCH could inhibit the activated microglia N9 release of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6. The docking analysis was shown that MD-2, the coreceptor of TLR4, might be one of the targets of DCH.",Development and Validation of a Physical Activity Educational Module for Overweight and Obese Adolescents: CERGAS Programme.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035403,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Educational modules can be effective in educating and motivating adolescents to participate in physical activity (PA). This paper describes the development and validation of a PA educational module for use in an obesity intervention programme, CEria Respek Gigih Aktif Sihat (CERGAS). The present study was conducted in three phases: Phase I was composed of needs assessments with four focus group discussions to elicit adolescents' opinions regarding module content and design, Phase II was the development of the PA module, while Phase III was content and face validation. A content validity index (CVI) was used to assess content validity quantitatively, with a CVI of more than 0.79 being considered appropriate. The needs assessments indicated that content of interest to adolescents included: the benefits of exercise; exercise techniques; ways to increase PA and how to stay motivated. Attractive graphic design was determined as a way to draw the adolescents' attention. The module covered five topics: ""Let's Be Active""; ""Exercise and Fitness""; ""Staying Safe during Exercise and Physical Activity""; ""Planning for Success"" and ""How to Overcome Sedentariness and Get Moving"". The module was found to have good content validity (mean CVI = 0.85). Expert members made suggestions to improve the module. These suggestions were then accepted, and the module was modified accordingly. We concluded that the module has good content validity and can be used to improve PA knowledge amongst CERGAS participants.",Medical and Dietary Uses of N-Acetylcysteine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035402,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a plant antioxidant naturally found in onion, is a precursor to glutathione. It has been used as a drug since the 1960s and is listed on the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines as an antidote in poisonings. There are numerous other uses or proposed uses in medicine that are still in preclinical and clinical investigations. NAC is also used in food supplements and cosmetics. Despite its abundant use, there are projections that the NAC global market will grow in the next five years; therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a balanced view of further uses of NAC as a dietary supplement. Although NAC is considered a safe substance, the results among clinical trials are sometimes controversial or incomplete, like for many other antioxidants. More clinical trials are underway that will improve our understanding of NAC applicability.",Fabrication and Application of Novel Porous Scaffold in Situ-Loaded Graphene Oxide and Osteogenic Peptide by Cryogenic 3D Printing for Repairing Critical-Sized Bone Defect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035401,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Osteogenic peptides have been reported as highly effective in directing mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation in vitro and bone formation in vivo. Therefore, developing novel biomaterials for the controlled delivery of osteogenic peptides in scaffolds without lowering the peptide's biological activity is highly desirable. To repair a critical-sized bone defect to efficiently achieve personalized bone regeneration, a novel bioactive poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) composite scaffold, in which graphene oxide (GO) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-like peptide were loaded in situ (PTG/P), was produced by an original cryogenic 3D printing method. The scaffolds were mechanically comparable to human cancellous bone and hierarchically porous. The incorporation of GO further improved the scaffold wettability and mechanical strength. The in situ loaded peptides retained a high level of biological activity for an extended time, and the loading of GO in the scaffold further tuned the peptide release so that it was more sustained. Our in vitro study showed that the PTG/P scaffold promoted rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ingrowth into the scaffold and enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the in vivo study indicated that the novel PTG/P scaffold with sustained delivery of the peptide could significantly promote bone regeneration in a critical bone defect. Thus, the novel bioactive PTG/P scaffold with a customized shape, improved mechanical strength, sustainable peptide delivery, and excellent osteogenic ability has great potential in bone tissue regeneration.",On the Race for More Stretchable and Tough Hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035400,"Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Hydrogels are tridimensional networks that are able to retain important amounts of water. These soft materials can be obtained through self-assembling processes involving either hydrophilic molecules or polymers, allowing the formation of the corresponding covalently and physically cross-linked networks. Although the applicability of hydrogels in biomedicine has been exponentially growing due to their biocompatibility and different responses to stimuli, these materials have exhibited the particular feature of poor mechanical strength, and consequently, are brittle materials with low deformation. Due to this reason, a race has started to obtain more stretchable and tough hydrogels through different approaches. Within this context, this review article describes the most representative strategies and examples involving synthetic polymers with potential for biomedical applications.",A Novel Wearable EEG and ECG Recording System for Stress Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035399,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Suffering from continuous stress can lead to serious psychological and even physical disorders.

In this study, a novel wearable device that can measure electrocardiograms (ECG) and EEG simultaneously was designed to enable continuous stress monitoring in daily life. The developed system is easily worn by hanging from both ears, is lightweight (i.e., 42.5 g), and exhibits an excellent noise performance of 0.12 μVrms. Significant time and frequency features of HRV and EEG were found in two different stressors, namely the Stroop color word and mental arithmetic tests, using 14 young subjects. Stressor situations were classified using various HRV and EEG feature selections and a support vector machine technique. The five-fold cross-validation results obtained when using both EEG and HRV features showed the best performance with an accuracy of 87.5%, which demonstrated the requirement for simultaneous HRV and EEG measurements."

Human chromatin remodeling enzyme INO80 can be recruited to the p53REs of p21 promoter and negatively regulates p21. As one of the key subunits of the INO80 complex, YY1 has also been confirmed to bind to the p53RE sites of p21 promoter. Importantly, YY1 was recently reported to be bound and stabilized by BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein). Therefore, we hypothesized that the YY1/BCCIP complex plays an important role in regulating the transactivation of p21. Here we present evidence that the YY1/BCCIP complex coordinatively regulates p53RE-mediated p21 transactivation. We first confirmed the cross-interaction between YY1, BCCIP, and p53, suggesting an intrinsic link between three proteins in the regulation of p21 transcription. In dual luciferase assays, YY1 inhibited p53RE-mediated luciferase activity, whereas BCCIP revealed the opposite effect. More interestingly, the region 146-270 amino acids of YY1, which bound to BCCIP, increased p53-mediated luciferase activity, indicating the complexity of the YY1/BCCIP complex in co-regulating p21 transcription. Further in-depth research confirmed the co-occupancy of YY1/BCCIP with p53 at the p53RE-proximal region of p21. Lentiviral-mediated knockdown of BCCIP inhibited the recruitment of p53 and YY1 at the p53RE proximal region of p21; however, this phenomenon was reversed by expressing exogenous YY1, suggesting the collaborative regulation of YY1/BCCIP complex in p53RE-mediated p21 transcription. These data provide new insights into the transcriptional regulation of p21 by the YY1/BCCIP complex.",A Survey of Italian Dairy Farmers' Propensity for Precision Livestock Farming Tools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035387,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 30,"A targeted survey was designed with the aim of describing the diffusion of precision livestock farming (PLF) tools in one of the most intensive dairy farming provinces in Italy. Technicians at the Provincial Breeder Association of Cremona interviewed 490 dairy farmers and obtained data regarding the role and age of the respondents; the land owned by the farmers; their herd sizes (HS, lactating plus dry cows; small HS < 101, medium HS 101-200, large HS > 200 cows/herd); their average 305 day milk yield (low MY < 9501, medium MY 9501-10,500, high MY > 10,500 kg/head); the cow to employed worker ratio (low CW < 33, medium CW 33-47, high CW > 47 cows/worker); the use of PLF tools to monitor production, reproduction, and health; and the criteria and motivations for investing in PLF tools. The use of automated MY recording and estrus detection systems was primarily associated with HS (more present in larger farms), followed by MY (more present in more productive farms), and then CW (more present with a high cow: worker ratio). Concern about the time required to manage data was the most common subjective issue identified as negatively affecting the purchase of these tools. The future of PLF use in this region will depend upon the availability of an effective selection of tools on the market.",MapB Protein is the Essential Methionine Aminopeptidase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035386,Cells,2019 04 30,"M. tuberculosis (Mtb), which causes tuberculosis disease, continues to be a major global health threat. Correct identification of valid drug targets is important for the development of novel therapeutics that would shorten the current 6-9 month treatment regimen and target resistant bacteria. Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP), which remove the N-terminal methionine from newly synthesized proteins, are essential in all life forms (eukaryotes and prokaryotes). The MetAPs contribute to the cotranslational control of proteins as they determine their half life (N-terminal end rule) and facilitate further modifications such as acetylation and others. Mtb (and M. bovis) possess two MetAP isoforms, MetAP1a and MetAP1c, encoded by the mapA and mapB genes, respectively. Conflicting evidence was reported in the literature on which of the two variants is essential. To resolve this question, we performed a targeted genetic deletion of each of these two genes. We show that a deletion mutant of mapA is viable with only a weak growth defect. In contrast, we provide two lines of genetic evidence that mapB is indispensable. Furthermore, construction of double-deletion mutants as well as the introduction of point mutations into mapB resulting in proteins with partial activity showed partial, but not full, redundancy between mapB and mapA. We propose that it is MetAP1c (mapB) that is essentially required for mycobacteria and discuss potential reasons for its vitality.",Magnesium and Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035385,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Several drugs including diuretics and proton-pump inhibitors can cause magnesium loss and hypomagnesemia. Magnesium and drugs use the same transport and metabolism pathways in the body for their intestinal absorption, metabolism, and elimination. This means that when one or more drug is taken, there is always a potential risk of interaction with the magnesium status. Consequently the action of a drug may be adversely affected by magnesium (e.g., magnesium, calcium, and zinc can interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of tetracycline antibiotics) and simultaneously the physiological function of minerals such as magnesium may be impaired by a drug (e.g., diuretics induce renal magnesium loss). Given the ever-increasing number of drugs on the market and the frequency with which they are used, greater attention must be paid in daily medical and pharmaceutical practice focused in particular on the adverse effects of drug therapy on magnesium status in order to minimize the potential risk to the health of patients.",Effect of Multi-Directional Forging on the Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of β-Solidifying TiAl Alloy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035383,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This study systematically investigated the influence of multi-directional forging (MDF) on the microstructural evolution, hot deformation behavior, and tensile properties of a β-solidifying TiAl alloy. The initial lamellar microstructure of an as-cast alloy was remarkably refined and homogenized by three-step MDF. High temperatures and multi-pass deformations were conducive to the decomposition of lamellae. A crack-free billet was obtained through three-step MDF, with a deformation temperature of 1250 °C and a forging speed of 0.1 mm/s, indicating that MDF can be applied to β-solidifying TiAl alloys by the proper control of the alloy composition and process parameters. Microstructural observation showed that the billet mainly consists of fine and equiaxed γ grains and a small amount of β phase. The tensile properties of the multi-directional forged alloy were also significantly improved, due to microstructure refinement. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (δ) at room temperature were 689.4 MPa, and 0.83%, respectively. The alloy exhibits excellent ductility at 700 °C. When the temperature was increased to 700 °C, the UTS decreased to 556 MPa and δ increased to 5.98%, indicating that the alloy exhibits excellent ductility at 700 °C. As the temperature further increased to 750 °C, δ dramatically increased to 46.65%, indicating that the ductile-brittle transition temperature of the alloy is between 700 °C and 750 °C.",Impact of Extrinsic and Intrinsic Hypoxia on Catecholamine Biosynthesis in Absence or Presence of Hif2α in Pheochromocytoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035382,Cancers,2019 04 30,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) with activated pseudohypoxic pathways are associated with an immature catecholamine phenotype and carry a higher risk for metastasis. For improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms we investigated the impact of hypoxia and pseudohypoxia on catecholamine biosynthesis in pheochromocytoma cells naturally lacking Hif2α (MPC and MTT) or expressing both Hif1α and Hif2α (PC12). Cultivation under extrinsic hypoxia or in spheroid culture (intrinsic hypoxia) increased cellular dopamine and norepinephrine contents in all cell lines. To distinguish further between Hif1α- and Hif2α-driven effects we expressed Hif2α in MTT and MPC-mCherry cells (naturally lacking Hif2α). Presence of Hif2α resulted in similarly increased cellular dopamine and norepinephrine under hypoxia as in the control cells. Furthermore, hypoxia resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). A specific knockdown of Hif1α in PC12 diminished these effects. Pseudohypoxic conditions, simulated by expression of Hif2α under normoxia resulted in increased TH phosphorylation, further stimulated by extrinsic hypoxia. Correlations with PPGL tissue data led us to conclude that catecholamine biosynthesis under hypoxia is mainly mediated through increased phosphorylation of TH, regulated as a short-term response (24-48 h) by HIF1α. Continuous activation of hypoxia-related genes under pseudohypoxia leads to a HIF2α-mediated phosphorylation of TH (permanent status).",Cognitive Reserve Assessment Scale in Health (CRASH): Its Validity and Reliability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035381,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"(1) Background: The cognitive reserve (CR) concept has not been precisely defined in severe mental disorders and has been estimated using heterogeneous methods. This study aims to investigate and develop the psychometric properties of the Cognitive Reserve Assessment Scale in Health (CRASH), an instrument designed to measure CR in people with severe mental illness; (2) Methods: 100 patients with severe mental illness (non-affective psychoses and affective disorders) and 66 healthy controls were included. The internal consistency and convergent validity of CRASH were assessed. Spearman's correlations coefficients were also performed to examine the relationship between CRASH and neuropsychological tests, psychosocial functioning, and clinical course; (3) Results: The internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.903). The CRASH global score had a large positive correlation with the Cognitive reserve questionnaire total score (r = 0.838, p < 0.001), demonstrating good convergent validity. The correlation coefficients between the CRASH total scores and clinical, functional, and neuropsychological performance were different between groups. In order to provide clinical interpretation, severity classification based on diagnosis (non-affective psychotic disorders, affective disorders, and healthy controls) have been created; (4) Conclusions: CRASH is the first CR measure developed specifically for patients with severe mental illness, facilitating reliable and valid measurement of this construct.

Herein, we used a previously described whole cell-based mupirocin synergy assay to screen members of a 53,000 compound small molecule diversity library and simultaneously enrich for agents with cellular RnpA inhibitory activity. A medicinal chemistry-based campaign was launched to generate a preliminary structure activity relationship and guide early optimization of two novel chemical classes of RnpA inhibitors identified, phenylcarbamoyl cyclic thiophene and piperidinecarboxamide. Representatives of each chemical class displayed potent anti-staphylococcal activity, limited the protein's in vitro ptRNA processing and mRNA degradation activities, and exhibited favorable therapeutic indexes. The most potent piperidinecarboxamide RnpA inhibitor, JC2, displayed inhibition of cellular RnpA mRNA turnover, RnpA-depletion strain hypersusceptibility, and exhibited antimicrobial efficacy in a wax worm model of S. aureus infection. Taken together, these results establish that the whole cell screening assay used is amenable to identifying small molecule RnpA inhibitors within large chemical libraries and that the chemical classes identified here may represent progenitors of new classes of antimicrobials that target RnpA.",New Calibrator with Points Distributed Conical Helically for Online Calibration of C-Arm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035379,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"To improve the accuracy of calibration of C-arm, and overcome the space limitation in surgery, we proposed a new calibrator for online calibration of C-arm. After the image rectification by a polynomial fitting-based global correction method, the C-arm was assumed as an ideal pinhole model. The relationships between two kinds of spatial calibration errors and the distribution of fiducial points were studied: the performance of FRE (Fiducial Registration Error) and TRE (Target Registration Error) were not consistent, but both were best at the 12 marked points; the TRE decreased with the increase of the uniformity of calibration points distribution, and with the decrease of the distance between the target point and the center of calibration points. A calibrator with 12 fiducial points conical helically distributed, which could be placed on the knee, was an attractive option. A total of 10 experiments on C-arm calibration accuracy were conducted and the mean value of mapping error was 0.41 mm.

In obesity-associated inflammation, M1-type macrophages are predominant in the inflamed tissue, exerting pro-inflammatory responses. Our previous studies demonstrate that blackcurrant consumption attenuates hepatic inflammation and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammatory responses of splenocytes in obese mice. In this study, we determined whether blackcurrant modulates macrophage phenotypes to exert its anti-inflammatory action. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and human THP-1 macrophages were polarized into M1 macrophages in the presence or absence of blackcurrant extract (BCE). BCE repressed M1 polarization of both murine and human macrophages. Also, to gain insight into the role of blackcurrant metabolites produced in vivo in the regulation of macrophage phenotypes, BMDM were treated with serum obtained from lean or obese mice fed blackcurrant. While serum from lean mice fed blackcurrant did not exert either anti-inflammatory actions or suppressive effects on M1 polarization, serum from obese mice fed blackcurrant reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in BMDM. Our data demonstrate that BCE suppresses M1 polarization, with reduced pro-inflammatory responses. Moreover, this study suggests that blackcurrant metabolites may not exert their anti-inflammatory effect directly by altering macrophage phenotypes, but possibly by inhibiting the production of obesity-associated inflammatory factors."

Moreover, we use patch-wise strategy for splitting the high-resolution image into local patches and applying them to network training. The well-trained model is used for testing high-resolution SSS images produced by sonar sensor in an onboard Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). The experimental results show that RT-Seg can greatly reduce the number of parameters and floating point operations compared to other networks.

In the present study, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of suppression of adipogenesis in adipocytes by a limonoid, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (CG-1) from Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae), known as andiroba. CG-1 reduced the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides in a concentration-dependent manner. The expression levels of the adipogenic, lipogenic, and lipolytic genes were decreased by CG-1 treatment, whereas the glycerol release level was not affected. When CG-1 was added into the medium during days 0-2 of 6-days-adipogenesis, the accumulation of intracellular lipids and the mRNA levels of the adipogenesis-related genes were decreased. In addition, the phosphorylation level of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt in the early phase of adipocyte differentiation (within 1 day after initiating adipocyte differentiation) was reduced by CG-1. Furthermore, insulin-activated translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the plasma membranes in adipocytes was suppressed by CG-1, followed by decreased glucose uptake into the cells. These results indicate that an andiroba limonoid CG-1 suppressed the accumulation of intracellular lipids in the early phase of adipocyte differentiation through repression of IRS-1/Akt-mediated glucose uptake in adipocytes.",Efficacy and Long-Term Safety of H. pylori Eradication for Gastric Cancer Prevention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035365,Cancers,2019 04 30,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been shown to be a causal factor of gastric cancer in cohort studies and animal models. Meta-analysis of case-control studies nested within prospective cohorts showed that H. pylori infection was associated with a 5.9-fold increased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer. Prospective cohort studies showed that gastric cancer developed in 1-4% of H. pylori-infected subjects. Gastric cancer was successfully induced in Mongolian gerbils and insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) transgenic mice after inoculation of H. pylori. Meta-analysis of randomized control trials also showed that eradication of H. pylori may reduce the risk of gastric cancer. However, there are several concerns regarding the widespread use of antibiotics to prevent gastric cancer, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the perturbation of gut microbiota after H. pylori eradication. Recent studies showed that eradication of H. pylori resulted in an increase in the bacterial diversity and restoration of the relative abundance of other bacteria to levels similar to H. pylori non-infected subjects in the gastric microbiota. The administration of antibiotics may also alter the composition of intestinal microbiota. The α-diversity and β-diversity of fecal microbiota are significantly altered immediately after H. pylori eradication but are gradually restored to levels similar to those before therapy. Yet, the rate of recovery varies with regimens. The diversity was restored at week 8 after triple therapy but was not yet fully recovered at 1 year after concomitant and quadruple therapies. Some studies showed that supplementation of probiotics may reduce the dysbiosis during H. pylori eradication therapy. Although some earlier studies showed high levels of macrolide resistance after triple therapy, recent studies showed that the increased antibiotic resistance rate may be restored 2-12 months after eradication therapy. These results collectively provide evidence of the long-term safety of H. pylori eradication. Yet, more prospective cohort studies and randomized trials are warranted to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of H. pylori eradication for gastric cancer prevention.",CC-DTW: An Accurate Indoor Fingerprinting Localization Using Calibrated Channel State Information and Modified Dynamic Time Warping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035364,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Indoor wireless local area network (WLAN) based positioning technologies have boomed recently because of the huge demands of indoor location-based services (ILBS) and the wide deployment of commercial Wi-Fi devices. Channel state information (CSI) extracted from Wi-Fi signals could be calibrated and utilized as a fine-grained positioning feature for indoor fingerprinting localization. One of the main factors that would restrict the positioning accuracy of fingerprinting systems is the spatial resolution of fingerprints (SRF). This paper mainly focuses on the improvement of SRF for indoor CSI-based positioning and a calibrated CSI feature (CCF) with high SRF is established based on the preprocess of both measured amplitude and phase. In addition, a similarity calculation metric for the proposed CCF is designed based on modified dynamic time warping (MDTW). An indoor fingerprinting method based on CCF and MDTW, named CC-DTW, is then proposed to improve the positioning accuracy in indoors. Experiments are conducted in two indoor office testbeds, and the performances of the proposed CC-DTW, one time-reversal (TR) based approach and one Euclidean distance (ED) based approach are evaluated and discussed. The results show that the SRF of CC-DTW outperforms the TR-based one and the ED-based one in both two testbeds in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve metric, and the area under curve (AUC) metric.",Effect of the Electric Field on the Distribution Law of Chloride Ions and Microstructure in Concrete with the Addition of Mineral Admixtures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035363,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Migration testing of chloride under an electric field is a fast and effective method to determine the corrosion resistance of reinforced concrete against chloride. In this study, a series of admixture-involved (fly ash and slag) concrete specimens were produced for an accelerating chloride diffusion test in 3% NaCl solution under an electric field and natural chloride diffusion in 165 g/L NaCl solution under immersion conditions. Then, the chloride profile and pore structure of concretes aged 56 and 91 days were compared to investigate the effect of the electric field on chloride diffusion as well as the microstructure of the concrete. The results showed that, under accelerating electric field conditions, the degree to which chloride refined the internal pore structure of the concrete was weaker than that under natural immersion conditions. The applied electric field changed the pore structure inside the concrete, but it had little effect on the distribution of total, free, and bound chlorides and their mutual relationship. In addition, it is necessary to consider that the electric field effect on chloride migration varies with the concrete mix proportions.",New Glutamine-Containing Azaphilone Alkaloids from Deep-Sea-Derived Fungus Chaetomium globosum HDN151398.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035362,Marine drugs,2019 04 30,"Three new azaphilone alkaloids containing glutamine residues, namely N-glutarylchaetoviridins A-C (1-3), together with two related compounds (4 and 5) were isolated from the extract of Chaetomium globosum HDN151398, a fungus isolated from a deep-sea sediment sample collected in South China Sea. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR as well as HRESIMS spectroscopic data and chemical analysis. N-glutarylchaetoviridins A-C (1-3) represent the first class of chaetoviridins characterized by embedded glutamate residues. Amino acids incubation experiments produced five azaphilone laden different amino acids residues (6-10) which indicated that this method can enhanced the structural diversity of this strain by culturing with amino acids. Cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds were evaluated against a panel of human cancer cell lines.",The Association of Breakfast Frequency and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Factors among Adolescents in Malaysia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035361,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"Breakfast frequency is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Western populations, possibly via the types of food eaten or the timing of food consumption, but associations in Malaysian adolescents are unknown. While the timing of breakfast is similar, the type of food consumed at breakfast in Malaysia differs from Western diets, which allows novel insight into the mechanisms underlying breakfast-CVD risk associations. We investigated foods eaten for breakfast and associations between breakfast frequency and CVD risk factors in the Malaysian Health and Adolescents Longitudinal Research Team study (MyHeARTs). Breakfast (frequency of any food/drink reported as breakfast in 7-day diet history interviews) and CVD risk factors (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) were cross-sectionally associated using linear regression adjusting for potential confounders (n = 795, age 13 years). Twelve percent of adolescents never ate breakfast and 50% ate breakfast daily, containing mean (SD) 400 (±127) kilocalories. Commonly consumed breakfast foods were cereal-based dishes (primarily rice), confectionery (primarily sugar), hot/powdered drinks (primarily Milo), and high-fat milk (primarily sweetened condensed milk). After adjustment, each extra day of breakfast consumption per week was associated with a lower BMI (-0.34 kg/m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02, -0.66), and serum total (-0.07 mmol/L 95% CI -0.02, -0.13) and LDL (-0.07 mmol/L 95% CI -0.02, -0.12) cholesterol concentrations. Eating daily breakfast in Malaysia was associated with slightly lower BMI and total and LDL cholesterol concentrations among adolescents. Longitudinal studies and randomized trials could further establish causality.",Degradable Polymer Stars Based on Tannic Acid Cores by ATRP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035360,Polymers,2019 04 30,"Degradable polymers are crucial in order to reduce plastic environmental pollution and waste accumulation. In this paper, a natural product, tannic acid was modified to be used as a polymer star core. The tannic acid was modified with atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiators and characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR, and XPS. Twenty-five arm polymer stars were prepared by photoinduced ATRP of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) methacrylate) (molar mass Mw = 300 g/mol) (P(OEO300MA)). The polymer stars were degraded by cleaving the polymer star arms attached to the core by phenolic esters under mild basic conditions. The stars were analyzed before and after degradation by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Cytotoxicity assays were performed on the P(OEO300MA) stars and corresponding degraded polymers, and were found to be nontoxic at the concentrations tested.",ARNi: A Novel Approach to Counteract Cardiovascular Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035359,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) still represent the greatest burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Despite the enormous efforts over the last twenty years to limit the spread of cardiovascular risk factors, their prevalence is growing and control is still suboptimal. Therefore, the availability of new therapeutic tools that may interfere with different pathophysiological pathways to slow the establishment of clinical CVDs is important. Previously, the inhibition of neurohormonal systems, namely the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, has proven to be useful in the treatment of many CVDs. Attempts have recently been made to target an additional hormonal system, that of the natriuretic peptides (NPs), which, when dysregulated, can also play a role in the development CVDs. Indeed, a new class of drug, the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), has the ability to counteract the effects of angiotensin II as well as to increase the activity of NPs. ARNi have already been proven to be effective in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. New evidence has suggested that, in the next years, the field of ARNi application will widen to include other CVDs, such as heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction and hypertension.",The Effect of Humidity on Dielectric Properties of PP-Based Nano-Dielectric.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035358,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Nano-dielectrics are sensitive to humidity and easily degraded in damp environment because of the high surface energy of nanoparticles. In order to study the effect of humidity on the dielectric properties of nano-dielectric, polypropylene (PP) was modified by polyolefin elastomer (POE) and nano-SiO2, and the samples with obvious filling concentration were pre-selected by breakdown strength for damp aging. The aging experiments were carried out in different relative humidity. The dielectric properties of new, hygroscopic saturation and samples after drying were measured and analyzed. It is found that the breakdown strength of hygroscopic saturation nano-dielectrics decreased obviously compared with new samples, and it was difficult to recover after drying. The damp degradation resulted in different changing trends of permittivity of PP and nano-dielectric, but there were relaxation loss peaks of water in both of them. The influence of damp degradation on the trap distribution was studied by thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC), and it was found that the traps level introduced by water molecules was different in PP and nano-dielectrics. All experiment results showed that the performance of nano-dielectrics degraded obviously in humid environment, and it was difficult to recover even after complete drying because of the existence of bounded water molecules in nano-dielectrics."

Victorian Football League Women's competition (VFLW) players (n = 30) aged 18-35 (weight: 64.5 kg ± 8.0; height: 168.2 cm ± 7.6) were recruited from Victoria, Australia. Nutritional intake was quantified on training days using the Automated 24 h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-Australia), and sports nutrition knowledge was measured by the 88-item Sports Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (SNKQ). The risk of LEA was assessed using the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q). Daily mean carbohydrate intake in the current investigation was 3 g⋅kg-1⋅d-1, therefore, below the minimum carbohydrate recommendation for moderate exercise of approximately one hour per day (5-7 g⋅kg-1⋅d-1) and for moderate to intense exercise for 1-3 h per day (6-10 g⋅kg-1⋅d-1) for 96.3% and 100% of players, respectively. Daily mean protein intake was 1.5 g⋅kg-1⋅d-1, therefore, consistent with recommendations (1.2-2.0 g⋅kg-1⋅d-1) for 77.8% of players. Daily mean calcium intake was 924.8 mg⋅d-1, therefore, below recommendations (1000 mg⋅d-1) for 65.5% of players, while mean iron intake was 12.2 mg⋅d-1, also below recommendations (18 mg⋅d-1) for 100% of players. Players answered 54.5% of SNKQ questions correctly, with the lowest scores observed in the section on supplements. Risk of LEA was evident in 30% of players, with no differences in carbohydrate (p = 0.238), protein (p = 0.296), fat (p = 0.490) or energy (p = 0.971) intakes between players at risk of LEA and those not at risk. The results suggest that female Australian rules football players have an inadequate intake of carbohydrate and calcium and low sports nutrition knowledge. Further investigation to assess the risk of LEA using direct measures is required.",A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Insects in Feed on Poultry Growth Performances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035345,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 30,"We investigated and summarized results from studies evaluating the effects of feeding poultry with insects on their growth performances. After a systematic review of studies published since 2000, two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of each one based on predefined inclusion criteria. We extracted information on the study design, insects, avian species, and growth performances, i.e., average daily gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio. Next, we estimated pooled differences between performances of poultry fed a diet with vs. without insects through random-effects meta-analysis models. Additionally, these models evaluated the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity across studies. Of the 75 studies reviewed, 41 met the inclusion criteria and included 174 trials. With respect to diets without insects, pooled differences in growth performances were statistically not different from the null, but heterogeneity was marked across studies. Average daily gain decreased with increasing inclusion rates of insects, going below the null for rates of 10% and more. Grasshoppers were negatively associated with the average daily gain and positively associated with feed intake. The country of publication was another source of heterogeneity across publications. Overall, our results show insects should substitute only partially conventional protein sources and not be grasshoppers to guarantee the appropriate growth of birds.",Adaptive Changes of Glioblastoma Cells Following Exposure to Hypoxic (1% Oxygen) Tumour Microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035344,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumour, with a median survival rate of between 15 to 17 months. Heterogeneous regions occur in glioblastoma as a result of oxygen gradients which ranges from 0.1% to 10% in vivo. Emerging evidence suggests that tumour hypoxia leads to increased aggressiveness and chemo/radio resistance. Yet, few in vitro studies have been performed in hypoxia. Using three glioblastoma cell-lines (U87, U251, and SNB19), the adaptation of glioblastoma cells in a 1% (hypoxia) and 20% (normoxia) oxygen microenvironment on proliferation, metabolism, migration, neurosphere formation, CD133 and VEGF expression was investigated. Compared to cells maintained in normoxia (20% oxygen), glioblastoma cells adapted to 1% oxygen tension by reducing proliferation and enhancing metabolism. Both migratory tendency and neurosphere formation ability were greatly limited. In addition, hypoxic-mediated gene upregulation (CD133 and VEGF) was reversed when cells were removed from the hypoxic environment. Collectively, our results reveal that hypoxia plays a pivotal role in changing the behaviour of glioblastoma cells. We have also shown that genetic modulation can be reversed, supporting the concept of reversibility. Thus, understanding the degree of oxygen gradient in glioblastoma will be crucial in personalising treatment for glioblastoma patients.",Effects of Silymarin on the In Vivo Pharmacokinetics of Simvastatin and Its Active Metabolite in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035343,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Herein, the effect of silymarin pretreatment on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin in rats was evaluated. To ensure the accuracy of the results, a rapid and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was established for simultaneous quantification of simvastatin (SV) and its active metabolite simvastatin acid (SVA). This method was applied for studying the pharmacokinetic interactions in rats after oral co-administration of silymarin (45 mg/kg) and different concentrations of SV. The major pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax, tmax, t1/2, mean residence time (MRT), elimination rate constant (λz) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-12h), were calculated using the non-compartmental model. The results showed that the co-administration of silymarin and SV significantly increased the Cmax and AUC0-12h of SVA compared with SV alone, while there was no significant difference with regards to Tmax and t1/2. However, SV pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly affected by silymarin pretreatment. Therefore, these changes indicated that drug-drug interactions may occur after co-administration of silymarin and SV.",Pulmonary Vessel Obstruction Does Not Correlate with Severity of Pulmonary Embolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035342,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 30,"The aim of the present study was to analyze possible relationships between pulmonary vessel obstruction and clinically relevant parameters and scores in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Overall, 246 patients (48.8% women and 51.2% men) with a mean age of 64.0 ± 17.1 years were involved in the retrospective study. The following clinical scores were calculated in the patients: Wells score, Geneva score, and pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) score. Levels of D-dimer (µg/mL), lactate, pH, troponin, and N-terminal natriuretic peptide (BNP, pg/mL) were acquired. Thrombotic obstruction of the pulmonary arteries was quantified according to Mastora score. The data collected were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to analyze associations between the investigated parameters. P values < 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. Mastora score correlated weakly with lactate level and tended to correlate with D-dimer and BNP levels. No other clinical or serological parameters correlated significantly with clot burden. Thrombotic obstruction of pulmonary vessels did not correlate with clinical severity of PE.",Structural Influence on the Post-Clustering Stability of DNA/AgNCs Fluorescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035341,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"DNA-encapsulated Silver Nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs) based sensors have gained increasing attention in past years due to their diverse applications in bioimaging, biosensing, and enzymatic assays. Given the potential of DNA/AgNCs for practical applications, the systematic studies of the fluorescent stability over an extended period is necessary. However, the correlation between nucleic acid properties and the long-term stability of DNA/AgNCs is less known. With locking-to-unlocking sensors, in which the secondary structure of DNA template is standardized, we investigated the correlation between the DNA structure and the fluorescence stability of AgNCs. Post-synthesis of DNA/AgNCs, the fluorescence, and structures of templates were monitored over three weeks. By combining the fluorescence spectroscopy with the in-gel fluorescent assay, we found that AgNCs encapsulated by dimer-structured DNA/AgNCs templates were more stable than those of hairpin-structured DNA/AgNCs templates. While the orange fluorescence from the dimer templates increased over three weeks, the red fluorescence from the hairpin templates was diminished by >80% within two days at room temperature. Further tests revealed that hairpin-encapsulated red-emissive AgNCs is more sensitive to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen compared to dimer encapsulated orange AgNCs. Our observations may provide an important clue in encapsulating photophysically more stable AgNCs by tuning the DNA secondary structures. The proposed strategy here can be essential for pragmatic applications of DNA/AgNCs templates.",Rapid Determination of Amino Acids of Nitraria tangutorum Bobr. from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using HPLC-FLD-MS/MS and a Highly Selective and Sensitive Pre-Column Derivatization Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035340,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Amino acids are indispensable components of living organisms. The high amino acid content in Nitraria tangutorum Bobr. fruit distinguishes it from other berry plants and is of great significance to its nutritional value. Herein, using 10-ethyl-acridine-3-sulfonyl chloride as a fluorescent pre-column labeling reagent, a method for the efficient and rapid determination of amino acid content in N. tangutorum by pre-column fluorescence derivatization and on-line mass spectrometry was established and further validated. The limits of detection (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) were between 0.13 and 1.13 nmol/L, with a linear coefficient greater than 0.997 and a relative standard deviation between 1.37% and 2.64%. In addition, the method required a short analysis time, separating 19 amino acids within 20 min. Subsequently, the method was used to analyze the amino acid content of Nitraria tangutorum Bobr. from tissues retrieved from seven regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Nitraria tangutorum Bobr. was shown to contain a large amount of amino acids, with the total content and main amino acid varying between the different tissues.

The characterization and properties of Z-LWACFs were investigated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), methylene blue (MB) and iodine adsorption. Two activation process methods were employed to prepare Z-LWACF and contrasted with others fibers. The results showed that the Z-LWACF obtained by one-step ZnCl2 activation present higher yields and specific surface area than others fibers. Besides, the change of MB adsorption value at different impregnation ratios was consistent with pore structure distribution above 1.5 nm pore size, indicating that larger micropores (1.5 to 2 nm) and mesopores played a major role in the MB adsorption by Z-LWACF. The kinetics of MB adsorption process was found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the adsorption rate was controlled by chemisorption. It was also found that MB adsroption by Z-LWACF belonged to monolayer adsorption and Z-LWACF was easy to adsorb MB.",Marek's Disease Virus Regulates the Ubiquitylome of Chicken CD4+ T Cells to Promote Tumorigenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035338,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of cellular proteins are reciprocal reactions catalyzed by ubiquitination-related enzymes and deubiquitinase (DUB) which regulate almost all cellular processes. Marek's disease virus (MDV) encodes a viral DUB that plays an important role in the MDV pathogenicity. Chicken CD4+ T-cell lymphoma induced by MDV is a key contributor to multiple visceral tumors and immunosuppression of chickens with Marek's disease (MD). However, alterations in the ubiquitylome of MDV-induced T lymphoma cells are still unclear. In this study, a specific antibody against K-ε-GG was used to isolate ubiquitinated peptides from CD4+ T cells and MD T lymphoma cells. Mass spectrometry was used to compare and analyze alterations in the ubiquitylome. Our results showed that the ubiquitination of 717 and 778 proteins was significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, in T lymphoma cells. MDV up- and downregulated ubiquitination of a similar percentage of proteins. The ubiquitination of transferases, especially serine/threonine kinases, was the main regulatory target of MDV. Compared with CD4+ T cells of the control group, MDV mainly altered the ubiquitylome associated with the signal transduction, immune system, cancer, and infectious disease pathways in T lymphoma cells. In these pathways, the ubiquitination of CDK1, IL-18, PRKCB, ETV6, and EST1 proteins was significantly up- or downregulated as shown by immunoblotting. The current study revealed that the MDV infection could exert a significant influence on the ubiquitylome of CD4+ T cells.",Health Inequality between Migrant and Non-Migrant Workers in an Industrial Zone of Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035337,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Vietnam has experienced massive internal migration waves from rural to industrialized zones. However, little efforts have been made to understand differences in health conditions and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between local and migrant industrial workers. This study aimed to examine the inequality in health status and HRQOL between these workers. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 289 Vietnamese workers at three industrial areas in Hanoi and Bac Ninh. Self-reported health status and HRQOL were measured using the EuroQOL-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. Sociodemographic, working, and environmental factors were also investigated. Overall, the mean EQ-5D index was 0.74 (SD = 0.21) and the average number of health problems in the last 12 months in our sample was 1.91 (SD = 1.63) problems. Migrant people had a lower EQ-5D index (β = -0.08, p < 0.01) and more health problems (β = 0.20, p < 0.05) compared to local workers. Those being male, working in the same posture more than 60 min, and exposed to more hazards at work were correlated with a lower EQ-5D index and higher number of health problems. The results highlighted inequalities in health status and HRQOL between migrant and local workers. Reinforcing regular health check-ups, ensuring sufficient protective equipment and working conditions may help improve the health outcomes of the workers."

Postoperative PaO2 was lower in the high FiO2 group compared with the low FiO2 group (mean difference (MD) -4.97 mmHg, 95% CI -8.21 to -1.72, p = 0.003). Postoperative alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDO2) was higher (MD 3.42 mmHg, 95% CI 0.95 to 5.89, p = 0.007) and the extent of atelectasis was more severe (MD 2.04%, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.94, p = 0.04) in high intraoperative FiO2 group compared with low FiO2 group. However, postoperative SpO2 was comparable between the two groups. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that high inspired oxygen fraction during anesthesia may impair postoperative pulmonary parameters. Cautious approach in intraoperative inspired oxygen fraction is required for patients susceptible to postoperative pulmonary complications.",Olive Leaf Extract (OleaVita) Suppresses Inflammatory Cytokine Production and NLRP3 Inflammasomes in Human Placenta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035323,Nutrients,2019 04 30,"The placenta is essential for pregnancy and produces both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, involving interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8, from placental tissues is associated with pregnancy complications. Olive leaf extract has several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory functions. OleaVita is a new commercial olive leaf extract; it is hypothesized to suppress placental inflammation. In human placental tissue culture, OleaVita treatment inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB p65 protein expression. OleaVita also suppressed toll-like receptor ligands-induced IL-1β secretion in human placental tissues. IL-1β is regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasomes, a pivotal regulator of various diseases. OleaVita significantly decreased NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β protein expression, suggesting that it has an inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, OleaVita is beneficial as an inhibitor of inflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and may be used as a supplement for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases.",Single-Domain Antibodies Represent Novel Alternatives to Monoclonal Antibodies as Targeting Agents against the Human Papillomavirus 16 E6 Protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035322,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Approximately one fifth of all malignancies worldwide are etiologically associated with a persistent viral or bacterial infection. Thus, there is a particular interest in therapeutic molecules which use components of a natural immune response to specifically inhibit oncogenic microbial proteins, as it is anticipated they will elicit fewer off-target effects than conventional treatments. This concept has been explored in the context of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)-related cancers, through the development of monoclonal antibodies and fragments thereof against the viral E6 oncoprotein. Challenges related to the biology of E6 as well as the functional properties of the antibodies themselves appear to have precluded their clinical translation. Here, we addressed these issues by exploring the utility of the variable domains of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies (denoted as VHHs). Through construction and panning of two llama, immune VHH phage display libraries, a pool of potential VHHs was isolated. The interactions of these with recombinant E6 were further characterized using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting under denaturing and native conditions, and surface plasmon resonance. Three VHHs were identified that bound recombinant E6 with nanomolar affinities. Our results lead the way for subsequent studies into the ability of these novel molecules to inhibit HPV16-infected cells in vitro and in vivo.","How Anesthetic, Analgesic and Other Non-Surgical Techniques During Cancer Surgery Might Affect Postoperative Oncologic Outcomes: A Summary of Current State of Evidence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035321,Cancers,2019 04 30,"The question of whether anesthetic, analgesic or other perioperative intervention during cancer resection surgery might influence long-term oncologic outcomes has generated much attention over the past 13 years. A wealth of experimental and observational clinical data have been published, but the results of prospective, randomized clinical trials are awaited. The European Union supports a pan-European network of researchers, clinicians and industry partners engaged in this question (COST Action 15204: Euro-Periscope). In this narrative review, members of the Euro-Periscope network briefly summarize the current state of evidence pertaining to the potential effects of the most commonly deployed anesthetic and analgesic techniques and other non-surgical interventions during cancer resection surgery on tumor recurrence or metastasis.",Cholesterol Trafficking: An Emerging Therapeutic Target for Angiogenesis and Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035320,Cells,2019 04 30,"Cholesterol is an essential structural component of cellular membranes. In addition to the structural role, it also serves as a precursor to a variety of steroid hormones and has diverse functions in intracellular signal transduction. As one of its functions in cell signaling, recent evidence suggests that cholesterol plays a key role in regulating angiogenesis. This review discusses the role of cholesterol in angiogenesis, with a particular emphasis on cholesterol trafficking in endothelial cell signaling. Small molecule inhibitors of cholesterol trafficking and their preclinical and clinical development targeting angiogenesis and cancer are also discussed.",Influencing Factors and Theoretical Models for the Surface Topography in Diamond Turning Process: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035319,Micromachines,2019 04 30,"In this work, the influencing factors and corresponding theoretical models for the surface topography in diamond turning process are reviewed. The surface profile on one tool feed is the elementary unit of surface topography. The influences coupled with the models of the duplication effect of the tool edge profile, material spring back, and plastic side flow are outlined in this part. In light of the surface profile on one tool feed and ""trim principle"", the modeling methods of surface topography along the radial direction (2D surface topography) are commented. Moreover, the influence of the vibration between the diamond tool and workpiece on the 2D surface topography is discussed, and the theoretical models are summarized. Finally, the issues for modeling of 3D surface topography, particularly the influences of material defects, are analyzed. According to the state-of-the-art surface topography model of the diamond turned component, future work in this field is therefore predicted.",Mosquito Acetylcholinesterase as a Target for Novel Phenyl-Substituted Carbamates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035318,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"New insecticides are needed for control of disease-vectoring mosquitoes and this research evaluates the activity of new carbamate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Biochemical and toxicological characterization of carbamates based on the parent structure of terbam, 3-tert-butylphenyl methylcarbamate, was performed. In vitro enzyme inhibition selectivity (Anopheles gambiae versus human) was assessed by the Ellman assay, as well as the lethality to whole insects by the World Health Organization (WHO) paper contact assay. Bromination at the phenyl C6 position increased inhibitory potency to both AChEs, whereas a 6-iodo substituent led to loss of potency, and both halogenations caused a significant reduction of mosquitocidal activity. Similarly, installation of a hexyl substituent at C6 drastically reduced inhibition of AgAChE, but showed a smaller reduction in the inhibition of hAChE. A series of 4-carboxamido analogs of the parent compound gave reduced activity against AgAChE and generally showed more activity against hAChE than AgAChE. Replacement of the 3-t-buyl group with CF3 resulted in poor anticholinesterase activity, but this compound did have measurable mosquitocidal activity. A series of methyl- and fluoro- analogs of 3-trialkylsilyl compounds were also synthesized, but unfortunately resulted in disappointing activity. Finally, a series of sulfenylated proinsecticides showed poor paper contact toxicity, but one of them had topical activity against adult female Anopheles gambiae. Overall, the analogs prepared here contributed to a better understanding of carbamate structure-activity relationships (SAR), but no new significant leads were generated.",The Effect of Viscosity-Modifying Admixture on the Extrudability of Limestone and Calcined Clay-Based Cementitious Material for Extrusion-Based 3D Concrete Printing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035317,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"To investigate the effects of viscosity-modifying admixture (VMA) on the extrudability of limestone and calcined clay-based cementitious materials, three mix designs with different dosages of VMA were proposed in this study. The ram extrusion was utilized as an extrusion model for exploring the fresh properties of printable materials. Two methods were used, based on the ram extruder setup-(a) extruding materials with the same extrusion speed at different rest times to determine how the pressure changes with time; (b) extruding materials with different extrusion speeds at the same rest time to investigate the material flow parameters using the Basterfield et al. model. The main findings of this study could be summarized as-(1) the extrusion pressure of all mix designs exhibited an increasing trend with time. At the same tested age, the extrusion pressure under 0.25 mm/s of piston speed was increased and the shape retention of the extruded filaments was enhanced by increasing the dosage of VMA; (2) the correlation between the experimental results and the Basterfield et al. model was excellent (R-squared value: 0.99). The mixture with a higher content of VMA showed an increased elongational yield stress, flow consistency, and shear yield stress.",Risk Factors and Prediction of Leptospiral Seropositivity Among Dogs and Dog Handlers in Malaysia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035316,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"This study determined the potential risk factors that may contribute to seropositivity among dogs and dog handlers from working dog and dog shelter institutions. Data was collected from dogs (n = 266) and dog handlers (n = 161) using a standardised guided questionnaire. Serum obtained from the dogs and dog handlers was tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). A logistic regression analysis was used to predict leptospiral seropositivity of dogs and dog handlers based on potential risk factors. A total of 22.2% of dogs and 21.7% of dog handlers were seropositive. The significant predictors for the dogs' seropositivity were presence of rats (OR = 4.61 (95% CI: 1.05, 20.33), p = 0.043) and shared common area (OR = 5.12 (95% CI: 1.94, 13.46), p = 0.001) within the organisation. Significant predictor for dog handler seropositivity was contact time with the dogs of more than six hours/day (OR = 3.28 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.40), p = 0.013) after controlling for the effect of other risk factors such as small mammal contact, rat infestation at home, flooding at housing area (within three months) and urban locality. The exposure to various disease sources identified poses risk to dogs and dog handlers. Risk could be reduced with adequate application of protection at work while handling dogs and thus limiting contact with these sources and reducing exposure to infection.","Removal of Chromates and Sulphates by Mg/Fe LDH and Heterostructured LDH/Halloysite Materials: Efficiency, Selectivity, and Stability of Adsorbents in Single- and Multi-Element Systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035314,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Industrial wastewaters often contain mobile and toxic anions that cannot be removed by precipitation techniques and most known adsorbents. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are excellent scavengers of anions; however, their use in real applications is of minor importance owing to their swelling behavior and high cost of production. The performed research shows the possibility of obtaining Mg/Fe LDH using natural magnesite. Moreover, heterostructured LDH/halloysite materials were synthesized. The adsorption efficiency of these materials was very high in both single- and multi-element systems, confirming the LDH selectivity. This was with the exception of wastewaters containing a high concentration of chlorides, which clearly hampered the removal of Cr(VI) and S(VI). The measurements indicated that LDH dissolution took place to a small extent (<10 wt%). The LDH/halloysite materials showed lower efficiency than the raw LDH; however, the clay presence has several benefits in terms of future applications: (i) it significantly reduces the pH, especially in contrast to the calcined LDH, which enables the reuse or safe disposal of purified water; (ii) it reduces swelling of the composite, which opens the possibility for applications in column adsorption; (iii) it induces dual adsorption properties through additional cation adsorption; and (iv) it substantially lowers the price of the adsorbent."

Obesity is linked to impaired male gonadal function and is currently a major cause of hypogonadism. Besides signs and symptoms directly derived from decreased circulating testosterone levels, males with obesity also present poor fertility outcomes, further evidencing the parallelism between obesity and male reproductive function. In addition, males with androgen deficiency also exhibit increased fat accumulation and reduced muscle and mineral bone mass. Thus, compelling evidence highlights a vicious cycle where male hypogonadism can lead to increased adiposity, while obesity can be a cause for male hypogonadism. On the opposite direction, sustained weight loss can attain amelioration of male gonadal function. In this scenario, a thorough evaluation of gonadal function in men with obesity is crucial to dissect the causes from the consequences in order to target clinical interventions towards maximized improvement of reproductive health. This review will address the causes and consequences of the bidirectional relationship between obesity and hypogonadism, highlighting the implicit male reproductive repercussions.",Chemotherapy-induced cachexia dysregulates hypothalamic and systemic lipoamines and is attenuated by cannabigerol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035309,"Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",2019 04 29,"Muscle wasting, anorexia, and metabolic dysregulation are common side-effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, having a dose-limiting effect on treatment efficacy, and compromising quality of life and mortality. Extracts of Cannabis sativa, and analogues of the major phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, have been used to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced appetite loss and nausea for decades. However, psychoactive side-effects limit their clinical utility, and they have little efficacy against weight loss. We recently established that the non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG) stimulates appetite in healthy rats, without neuromotor side-effects. The present study assessed whether CBG attenuates anorexia and/or other cachectic effects induced by the broad-spectrum chemotherapy agent cisplatin.",Systematic review and case series: flexible sigmoidoscopy identifies most cases of checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035308,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 05 28,Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used in the treatment of multiple advanced stage cancers but can induce immune-mediated colitis necessitating treatment with immunosuppressive medications.

Here, we first reported the structure of RadD from Escherichia coli containing two RecA-like domains, a zinc finger motif, and a C-terminal domain. Based on the structure of RadD and other SF2 proteins, we then built a model of the RedD-ATP complex.",Impact of crystallinity and crystal size of nanostructured carbonated hydroxyapatite on pre-osteoblast in vitro biocompatibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035306,Journal of biomedical materials research. Part A,2019 05 15,"Nanostructured carbonated hydroxyapatite (nCHA) is a promising biomaterial for bone tissue engineering due to its chemical properties, similar to those of the bone mineral phase and its enhanced in vivo bioresorption. However, the biological effects of nCHA nanoparticles on cells and tissues are not sufficiently known. This study assessed the impact of exposing pre-osteoblasts to suspensions with high doses of nCHA nanoparticles with high or low crystallinity. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were cultured for 1 or 7 days in a culture medium previously exposed to CHA nanoparticles for 1 day. Control groups were produced by centrifugation for removal of bigger nCHA aggregates before exposure. Interaction of nanoparticles with the culture medium drastically changed medium composition, promoting Ca, P, and protein adsorption. Transmission Electron microscopy revealed that exposed cells were able to internalize both materials, which seemed concentrated inside endosomes. No cytotoxicity was observed for both materials, regardless of centrifugation, and the exposure did not induce alterations in the release of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Morphological analysis revealed strong interactions of nCHA aggregates with cell surfaces, however without marked alterations in morphological features and cytoskeleton ultrastructure. The overall in vitro biocompatibility of nCHA materials, regardless of physicochemical characteristics such as crystallinity, encourages further studies on their clinical applications.",De novo prediction of the elemental composition of peptides and proteins based on a single mass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035305,Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,2019 04 29,"Identification of peptides and proteins is a common task in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, but often fails to deliver a comprehensive list of identifications. Downstream analysis, quantitative or qualitative, depends on the outcome of this process. Despite continuous improvement of computational methods, a large fraction of the screened peptides and/or proteins remains unidentified. We introduce here pacMASS, a method that de novo predicts the elemental composition of peptides and small proteins based on a single accurate mass, i.e., the observed monoisotopic or average mass.

Like all other yeast species, it needs to accumulate high amounts of potassium cations, which are needed for proliferation and many other cell functions. A search in the sequenced genomes of 9 C. krusei strains revealed the existence of twohighly conserved genes encoding putative potassium uptake systems. Both of them belong to the TRK family, whose members have been found in all the sequenced genomes of species from the Saccharomycetales subclade. Analysis and comparison of the two C. kruseiTrk sequences revealed all the typical featuresof yeast Trk proteins, but also an unusual extension of the CkTrk2 hydrophilic N-terminus. The expression of both putative CkTRK genes in S. cerevisiae lacking its own potassium importers showed that only CkTrk1 is able to complement the absence of S. cerevisiae's own transporters and provide cells with a sufficient amount of potassium. Interestingly, a portion of the CkTrk1 molecules were localized to the vacuolar membrane. The presence of CkTrk2 had no evident phenotype, due to the fact that this protein was not correctly targeted to the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane. Thus CkTrk2 is the first studied yeast Trk protein to date which was not properly recognized and targeted to the plasma membrane upon heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae.",Mechanistic Links between Non-Coding RNAs and Myeloid Cell Inflammation in Atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035303,Thrombosis and haemostasis,2019 04 29,"Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the chronicity of atherosclerotic lesion development and progression. Myeloid cells are involved in all stages of atherosclerosis development: they contribute in early phases to endothelial dysfunction and create a pro-inflammatory environment responsible for disease progression. Numerous studies over the last decade have repeatedly provided evidence for the crucial importance for different classes of non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) in regulating gene expression, as well as messenger RNA and protein stability. Functional studies using tools to either over-express or inhibit these non-coding RNAs showcased strong effects on tempering vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis progression. With this current review article, we want to discuss prominent examples of non-coding RNAs, being either produced by myeloid cells or affecting their recruitment and activity in the context of vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis and consequential diseases (such as myocardial infarction and stroke). All of the discussed transcripts were thoroughly studied in mechanistic explorations, indicating that they have the capability to modulate inflammatory cascades in the vasculature during disease exacerbation.",Hemostatic Genes Exhibit a High Degree of Allele-Specific Regulation in Liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035302,Thrombosis and haemostasis,2019 04 29, Elucidating the genetic basis underlying hepatic hemostatic gene expression variability may contribute to unraveling genetic factors contributing to thrombotic or bleeding disorders.

Its major binding site is the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence present in several adhesive proteins. Upon platelet activation, inside-out signaling activates the complex permitting binding to RGD motif containing proteins, such as von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a large multidomain plasma GP essential to primary hemostasis, which can directly interact with platelets because it exhibits binding sites for GPIbα and GPIIb/IIIa in its A1 and C4 domain, respectively. A vast variety of VWF variants have been identified in which domain-specific mutations affect distinct functions of VWF but reduced GPIIb/IIIa binding has barely been studied so far. Here, we strived to investigate the influence of C domain mutations, which have been identified in patients diagnosed with von Willebrand disease (VWD), on VWF-GPIIb/IIIa interaction. To determine binding to membrane-incorporated GPIIb/IIIa in the absence of GPIbα, we developed and validated a cell-based binding assay which uses HEK293 cells stably expressing a constitutively active form of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex on their plasma membrane. By employing this assay, we measured GPIIb/IIIa binding of 14 VWF C domain mutants identified in VWD patients. Mutants p.Cys2257Arg, p.Gly2441Cys, p.Cys2477Tyr, and p.Pro2722Ala exhibited significantly reduced binding. Summarizing, we have developed a useful research tool to specifically investigate GPIIb/IIIa interaction with its protein binding partners and identified four VWF variants that exhibit impaired GPIIb/IIIa binding. At least in the homozygous state, this defect could contribute to the VWD phenotype."

In depressed adults, abnormalities in the dynamic functioning of frontoinsular networks, in particular, have been observed and linked to negative rumination. Thus, network dynamics may provide new insight into teen pathophysiology. Here, adolescents (n = 45, ages 13-19) with varying severity of depressive symptoms completed a resting-state functional MRI scan. Functional networks were evaluated using co-activation pattern analysis to identify whole-brain states of spatial co-activation that recurred across participants and time. Measures included: dwell time (proportion of scan spent in that network state), persistence (volume-to-volume maintenance of a network state), and transitions (frequency of moving from state A to state B). Analyses tested associations between depression or trait rumination and dynamics of network states involving frontoinsular and default network systems. Results indicated that adolescents showing increased dwell time in, and persistence of, a frontoinsular-default network state involving insula, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior regions of default network, reported more severe symptoms of depression. Further, adolescents who transitioned more frequently between the frontoinsular-default state and a prototypical default network state reported higher depression. Increased dominance and transition frequency of frontoinsular-default network states were also associated with higher rumination, and rumination mediated the associations between network dynamics and depression. Findings support a model in which abnormal frontoinsular dynamics confer vulnerability to maladaptive introspection, which in turn contributes to symptoms of adolescent depression.",Slow-release delivery enhances the pharmacological properties of oral 5-hydroxytryptophan: mouse proof-of-concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035282,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 05 11,"5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) has shown therapeutic promise in a range of human CNS disorders. But native 5-HTP immediate release (IR) is poorly druggable, as rapid absorption causes rapid onset of adverse events, and rapid elimination causes fluctuating exposure. Recently, we reported that 5-HTP delivered as slow-release (SR) in mice augmented the brain pro-serotonergic effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), without the usual adverse events associated with 5-HTP IR. However, our previous study entailed translational limitations, in terms of route, dose, and duration. Here we modeled oral 5-HTP SR in mice by administering 5-HTP via the food. We modeled oral SSRI treatment via fluoxetine in the water, in a regimen recapitulating clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 5-HTP SR produced plasma 5-HTP levels well within the range enhancing brain 5-HT function in humans. 5-HTP SR robustly increased brain 5-HT synthesis and levels. When administered with an SSRI, 5-HTP SR enhanced 5-HT-sensitive behaviors and neurotrophic mRNA expression. 5-HTP SR's pro-serotonergic effects were stronger in mice with endogenous brain 5-HT deficiency. In a comprehensive screen, 5-HTP SR was devoid of overt toxicological effects. The present preclinical data, appreciated in the context of published 5-HTP clinical data, suggest that 5-HTP SR could represent a new therapeutic approach to the plethora of CNS disorders potentially treatable with a pro-serotonergic drug. 5-HTP SR might in particular be therapeutically relevant when brain 5-HT deficiency is pathogenic and as an adjunctive augmentation therapy to SSRI therapy.",Expression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Related mRNAs in Chronic Otitis Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035281,ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties,2019 04 29,"Unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cause an ER stress response and can result in various pathologic conditions, including inflammation.

Two previous reports also describe the superficial branch of the radial nerve remaining superficial to the brachioradialis, although, in these reports, the nerve was more medial than is typical. We postulate that one of the most common anatomic variations of the superficial branch of the radial nerve is for it to remain superficial to the brachioradialis.

The fluorinated NPSs consisted of a hybrid particle core of perfluorosiloxane-polystyrene, doped with a fluorinated photosensitizer, and a biocompatible poly-l-lysine shell. Compared with non-fluorinated counterpart NPSs that are similarly prepared except for the replacement of perfluorosiloxane with alkoxysilane, the fluorinated NPSs saturated with O2 exhibit approximately 3.5 fold higher singlet oxygen production yield and higher in vitro PDT efficiency due to the O2-carrying capability of intra-particle 'F-C' bonds.",XAS studies of pressure-induced structural and electronic transformations in α-FeOOH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035277,Journal of physics.

Lett. 111 175501), supporting the H-bonds symmetrization in iron oxyhydroxide, resulting from the Fe3+ high-to-low spin crossover at above 45 GPa. Our study shows an applicability of the x-ray absorption spectroscopy in a further study of the H-bonds symmetrization phenomenon.",Fluorescent electrospun PMMA microfiber mats with embedded NaYF4: Yb/Er upconverting nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035276,Methods and applications in fluorescence,2019 05 23,"Functional upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) can offer new possibilities in fluorescent applications as they exhibit desired characteristic properties like large shift between the fluorescent emission signal and the infrared excitation wavelength, multi- and narrow-band absorption and emission in visible and near infrared - Vis/NIR, together with excellent photostability and low toxicity as opposed to semiconducting quantum dots. The upconversion luminescence emission or quenching characteristics of UCNPs can be altered upon exposure to physical or chemical environmental factors providing thus a functionality that can be utilized for sensing or imaging. Furthermore their functionalization with suitable indicator dyes or recognition elements can extend the range of luminescence response and ratiometric sensing to specific analytes. Synergistically, electrospun nano- and microfibers offering large surface area can enhance the functionality of UCNPs by retaining the fluorescence efficiency and improving the overall responsivity due to dramatically increased surface. For the optimization of this hybrid material system the controllable incorporation of UCNPs is required especially at increased concentration conditions needed for high brightness. Herein, we report the fabrication, morphological and optical characterization of electrospun polymer-based nanocomposite fibers, consisting of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and upconverting lanthanide doped nanoparticles of the type NaYF4 : 20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ @ NaYF4. Morphological studies regarding the uniformity and aggregation effects of the UCNP inclusion within the fibers have been implemented followed by upconversion emission characterization by pulsed near-infrared excitation. The study and optimization of such nanocomposite fibrous systems could provide useful insights for the development of efficient upconverting electrospun fiber mats for a number of imaging and sensing applications.",New coupling mechanism of titanium nitride nanosphere dimers at short separation distances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035275,Nanotechnology,2019 05 30,"The coupled localized plasmon modes generated by a metal plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) dimer induces a stronger plasmon enhanced electromagnetic field as well as a stronger optical response compared to that of a single NP. Owing to the small Drude damping factor, however, the absorption bandwidth of noble metallic NPs is insufficiently broad. Herein, the near-field wide band coupling absorption for 25 nm diameter TiN nanospheres is investigated in a homo-dimer arrangement for various separation distances using the finite element method. An enhancement of the wide band coupling absorption and a red-shift is found, which can be explained by an uncomplicated dipole-dipole coupling model at interparticle distances greater than 5 nm. At short separation distances, the coupling absorption of the TiN dimer exhibits a tremendous change, which is diametrically opposite the results found for a Au dimer. This unexpected change phenomenon is shown by calculation and analysis to be owing to the change of the charge distribution approach at short separation distances, which is demonstrated to play a key role in the wide band coupling characteristic variation. With decreasing separation gap, a new coupling mechanism caused by surface charge properties is responsible for the decline in coupling absorption as well as the break in the ruler equations for both plasmon shift and temperature enhancement.",Nanoinstabilities of Cu2O porous nanostructured films as driven by nanocurvature effect and thermal activation effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035274,Nanotechnology,2019 05 30,"In this work, the instabilities at the nanoscale (i.e. nanoinstabilities) of triangular pyramids-like Cu2O porous nanostructured films (PNFs) are studied by heating treatments under different atmosphere and temperature. It is found that the nanoscale building triangular pyramids turn round preferentially at the sharp angles and/or coalesce with their contacting ones by directional diffusion and plastic flow of atoms, which are driven by the nonuniformly-distributed surface nanocurvature. As a result, the triangular pyramids become quasi-sphere shape and the PNF evolves into a big, dense particles film. It is also observed that the heating or thermal activation effect efficiently promotes the reduction or oxidation of Cu2O pyramids and the crystallization or growth of the as-achieved Cu or CuO grains. The above physical and chemical instabilities or changes at the nanoscale of Cu2O PNFs can be well accounted for by the combined mechanism of nanocurvature effect and thermal activation effect. The nanocurvature effect can lower the energy barrier for the atom diffusion or plastic flow and lower the activation energy for the chemical reactions, while the thermal activation effect can supply the required kinetic energy or activation energy and make the atomic transportations and reactions kinetically possible. The findings reveal the evolution laws of morphology, crystal structure and composition of triangular pyramids-like Cu2O PNF during heating treatments, which can further be extended to other types of Cu2O PNFs. Also, the findings have important implications for the nanoinstabilities of Cu2O PNFs-based devices, especially those working at a high temperature."

But the stable attachment of biomolecules to PDMS for more robust and long-term performance of the PDMS-based devices has been a significant challenge, owing to its unique physical properties (e.g. hydrophobicity, dynamic molecular mobility). Herein, the PDMS membrane with tunable surface porosity is developed via high-pressure saturated steam technology in order to promote a strong and lasting bioadhesion to the PDMS membrane without additional processing steps. The resulting porous PDMS membranes demonstrate enhanced physical properties (e.g. Young's modulus, roughness, and air permeability), which is dependent on the membrane thickness. The bioactivity of porous PDMS membranes, evaluated by measuring the adhesion of various biomolecules and bioactivity of cells, shows significant improvement over conventional non-porous control. This effect can be attributed to the strong physical adsorption on the porous PDMS membrane by increased surface roughness and stiffness. In sum, the porous PDMS membrane provides a simple and yet highly effective platform to create bioactive surface for various biomedical devices.",Fermi- to non-Fermi-liquid crossover and Kondo behavior in two-dimensional (Cu2/3V1/3)V2S4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035261,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 04,"By means of a specific heat (C) and electrical resistivity ([Formula: see text]) study, we give evidence of a pronounced Fermi liquid (FL) behavior with sizable mass renormalization, [Formula: see text], up to unusually high temperatures  ∼70 K in the layered system (Cu2/3V1/3)V2S4. At low temperature, a marked upturn of both C and [Formula: see text] is suppressed by magnetic field, which suggests a picture of Kondo coupling between conduction electrons in the VS2 layers and impurity spins of the V3+ ions located between layers. This picture opens the possibility of controlling electronic correlations and the FL to non-FL crossover in simple layered materials. For instance, we envisage that the coupling between layers provided by the impurity spins may realize a two-channel Kondo state.",High-efficient and environmentally friendly enrichment of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes by combining short-time electrochemical pre-oxidation and combustion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035260,Nanotechnology,2019 06 14,"High purity semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) have bright prospects in the field of microelectronics, but their enrichment processes are usually very complicated and cost time and energy, which represent a major impediment for their future applications. Here, we report on a new efficient covalent modification enrichment approach that tackles this problem. Our method is to first selectively functionalize the surface of arc-discharge metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (m-SWCNTs) rapidly by electrochemical pre-oxidation at 7.0 V in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution, and subsequently followed up by removing the m-SWCNTs with a short-time combustion process at 600 °C for 30 s to enrich high purity s-SWCNTs. Although the surface of the s-SWCNTs was functionalized and heat-treated, the intrinsic tubular structure and electronic characteristics were well maintained. Besides, our approach, without any complex equipment or toxic reagents, is energy and time saving and can be easily scaled up. Milligrams of high-quality s-SWCNTs with high purity of more than 95 wt% can be easily obtained in only several minutes. The retention rate of s-SWCNTs after combustion is as high as 61 wt%.",EPO enhances the protective effects of MSCs in experimental hyperoxia-induced neonatal mice by promoting angiogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035257,Aging,2019 06 10,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common type of chronic lung disease in infancy; however, there is no effective treatment for it. In the present study, a neonatal mouse BPD model was established by continuous exposure to high oxygen (HO) levels. Mice were divided randomly into 5 groups: control, BPD, EPO, MSCs, and MSCs+EPO. At 2 weeks post-treatment, vessel density and the expression levels of endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) were significantly increased in the MSC+EPO group compared with the EPO or MSCs group alone; moreover, EPO significantly enhanced MSCs proliferation, migration, and anti-apoptosis ability in vitro. Furthermore, the MSCs could differentiate into cells that were positive for the type II alveolar epithelial cell (AECII)-specific marker surfactant protein-C, but not positive for the AECI-specific marker aquaporin 5. Our present results suggested that MSCs in combination with EPO could significantly attenuate lung injury in a neonatal mouse model of BPD. The mechanism may be by the indirect promotion of angiogenesis, which may involve the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.",The quest for pluripotency: a comparative analysis across mammalian species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035255,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 30,"Pluripotency is the developmental potential of a cell to give rise to all the cells in the three embryonic germ layers, including germline cells. Pluripotent Stem cells (PSCs) can be embryonic, germ cell or somatic cell in origin and can adopt alternative states of pluripotency: naïve or primed. Although several reports have described the differentiation of PSCs to extra-embryonic lineages, such as primitive endoderm and trophectoderm, this is still debated among scientists in the field. In this review, we integrate the recent findings on pluripotency among mammals, alternative states of pluripotency, signaling pathways associated with maintaining pluripotency and the nature of PSCs derived from various mammals. PSCs from humans and mouse have been the most extensively studied. In other mammalian species, more research is required for understanding the optimum in vitro conditions required for either achieving pluripotency or preservation of distinct pluripotent states. A comparative high-throughput analysis of PSCs of genes expressed in naïve or primed states of humans, non-human primates (NHP) and rodents, based on publicly available data-sets revealed the probable prominence of seven signaling pathways common among these species, irrespective of the states of pluripotency. We conclude by highlighting some of the unresolved questions and future directions of research on pluripotency in mammals.",EGF and IGF1 affect sunitinib activity in BP-NEN: new putative targets beyond VEGFR?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035254,Endocrine connections,2019 06 10,"Broncho-pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (BP-NENs) are neoplasms orphan of an efficient therapy. Available medical treatments derived from clinical trials are not specific for the management of this malignancy. Sunitinib is a multi-receptor tyrosine-kinases (RTKs) inhibitor that has already shown its efficacy in NENs, but there are no available data about its action in BP-NENs. Therefore, our aim was to understand the effects of RTKs inhibition promoted by sunitinib in order to evaluate new putative targets useful in malignancy treatment. Since our results underlined a role for EGFR and IGF1R in modulating sunitinib antiproliferative action, we investigated the effects of erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and linsitinib, an IGF1R inhibitor, in order to understand their function in regulating cells behaviour. Cell viability and caspase activation were evaluated on two immortalised human BP-NEN cell lines and primary cultures. Our results showed that after treatment with sunitinib and/or IGF1, EGF and VEGF, the antiproliferative effect of sunitinib was counteracted by EGF and IGF1 but not by VEGF. Therefore, we evaluated with AlphaScreen technology the phosphorylated EGFR and IGF1R levels in primary cultures treated with sunitinib and/or EGF and IGF1. Results showed a decrease of p-IGF1R after treatment with sunitinib and an increase after co-treatment with IGF1. Then, we assessed cell viability and caspase activation on BP-NEN cell lines after treatment with linsitinib and/or erlotinib. Results demonstrate that these two agents have a stronger antiproliferative effect compared to sunitinib. In conclusion, our results suggest that IGF1R and EGF1R could represent putative molecular targets in BP-NENs treatment.",Validity of free testosterone calculation in pregnant women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035253,Endocrine connections,2019 06 10,"Objective Increased maternal testosterone concentration during pregnancy may affect the fetus. Therefore it is clinically relevant to have a quick and reliable method to determine free testosterone levels. Current calculators for free testosterone are suspected to perform poorly during pregnancy due to suggested competition between high levels of estradiol and free (bio-active) testosterone for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) binding. Therefore, it is claimed that reliable calculation of free testosterone concentration is not possible. However, recent evidence on SHBG-binding sites questions the estradiol effect on the testosterone-SHBG binding during pregnancy. In this study, we investigated whether the free testosterone concentration can be calculated in pregnant women. Design and methods Free testosterone was measured with a specially developed equilibrium dialysis method combined with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Free testosterone was also calculated with the formulas of Vermeulen et al. and Ross et al. Results Total and free testosterone measured in healthy men and women were in good agreement with earlier reports. In pregnant women, total testosterone values were higher than in non-pregnant women, whereas free testosterone values were comparable. Calculated free testosterone levels in pregnant women were highly correlated, but marginally higher, compared to measured free testosterone levels. Conclusions We developed an equilibrium dialysis-LC-MS/MS method for the measurement of free testosterone in the low range of pregnant and non-pregnant women. Although during pregnancy total testosterone is increased, this is not the case for free testosterone. The free testosterone formulas perform well in pregnant women.",Cholestasis-associated glucocorticoid overexposure does not increase atherogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035252,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 04 30,"Chronic glucocorticoid overexposure predisposes to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans. Cholestatic liver disease is associated with increased plasma glucocorticoid levels. Here we determined, in a preclinical setting, whether the chronic presence of cholestatic liver disease also induces a concomitant negative impact on atherosclerosis susceptibility. Hereto, regular chow diet-fed atherosclerosis-susceptible hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E (APOE) knockout mice were treated with the bile duct toxicant alpha‑naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) for 8 weeks. ANIT exposure induced the development of fibrotic cholestatic liver disease as evident from collagen deposits and compensatory bile duct hyperproliferation within the liver and the rise in plasma levels of bilirubin (+60%; P<0.01) and bile acids (10-fold higher; P<0.01). Adrenal weights (+22%; P<0.01) and plasma corticosterone levels (+72%; P<0.01) were increased in ANIT-treated mice. In contrast, atherosclerosis susceptibility was not increased in response to ANIT feeding, despite the concomitant increase in plasma free cholesterol (+30%; P<0.01) and cholesteryl ester (+42%; P<0.001) levels. The ANIT-induced hypercorticosteronemia coincided with marked immunosuppression as judged from the 50% reduction (P<0.001) in circulating lymphocyte numbers. However, hepatic glucocorticoid signaling was not enhanced after ANIT treatment. It thus appears that the immunosuppressive effect of glucocorticoids is uncoupled from their metabolic effect under cholestatic disease conditions. In conclusion, we have shown that cholestatic liver disease-associated endogenous glucocorticoid overexposure does not increase atherosclerosis susceptibility in APOE knockout mice. Our studies provide novel preclinical evidence for the observations that the hypercholesterolemia seen in cholestatic human subjects does not translate into a higher risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",DNA methylation in thyroid cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035251,Endocrine-related cancer,2019 04 30,"In recent years, cancer genomics has provided new insights into genetic alterations and signaling pathways involved in thyroid cancer.

Recent technological advances have allowed the identification of novel differentially methylated regions, methylation signatures and potential biomarkers. However, despite recent progress in cataloging methylation alterations in thyroid cancer, many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this review is to comprehensively examine the current knowledge on DNA methylation in thyroid cancer and discuss its potential clinical applications. After providing a general overview of DNA methylation and its dysregulation in cancer, we carefully describe aberrant methylation changes in thyroid cancer and relate them to methylation patterns, global hypomethylation and gene-specific alterations. We hope this review helps to accelerate the use of the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential of DNA methylation for the benefit of thyroid cancer patients.",Inhibitory effect of four novel synthetic peptides on food spoilage yeasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035250,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 13,"The spoilage of foods caused by the growth of undesirable yeast species is a problem in the food industry. Yeast species such as Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been encountered in foods such as high sugar products, fruit juices, wine, mayonnaise, chocolate and soft drinks. The demand for new methods of preservations has increased because of the negative association attached to chemical preservatives. The sequence of a novel short peptide (KKFFRAWWAPRFLK-NH2) was modified to generate three versions of this original peptide. These peptides were tested for the inhibition of the yeasts mentioned above, allowing for the better understanding of their residue modifications. The range of the minimum inhibitory concentration was between 25 and 200 μg/mL. Zygosaccharomyces bailii was the most sensitive strain to the peptides, while Zygosaccharomyces rouxii was the most resistant. Membrane permeabilisation was found to be responsible for yeast inhibition at a level which was a two-fold increase of the MIC (400 μg/mL). The possibility of the production of reactive oxygen species was also assessed but was not recognised as a factor involved for the peptides' mode of action. Their stability in different environments was also tested, focusing on high salt, pH and thermal stability. The newly designed peptides showed good antifungal activity against some common food spoilage yeasts and has been proven effective in the application in Fanta Orange. These efficient novel peptides represent a new source of food preservation that can be used as an alternative for current controversial preservatives used in the food industry."

These bifunctional molecules recruit E3 ligases and target specific proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasome system (UPS). The degradation provides several advantages over inhibition in potency, selectivity and drug resistance. Thus, a variety of small molecule PROTACs have been discovered so far.

Particularly, antibiotic resistant microorganisms and multidrug resistance have posed a serious threat to health of the people. Since ages, metals and metal complexes have played key role in the development of contemporary chemotherapy. Many organic compounds used in medicine do not have a purely organic mode of action and require traces of metal ions directly or indirectly for activation or biotransformation. For decades, the metallopharmaceuticals have attracted researchers across the globe due to their amplified therapeutic/modulatory effect by altering the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the complexes towards biological receptors. Medicinally privileged natural and (semi)-synthetic chalcones have already been reported to possess a wide variety of pharmacological effects by modulating diverse molecular targets. The presence of carbonyl, hydroxyl, phenolic oxygen and/or heteroatom(s) in heterocyclic ring system makes them excellent chelating ligand for metal coordination. Particularly, the metal complexes of bidentate chalcone/Schiff base analogs and ferrocenyl chalcones have shown great potential. In this review, the chelating/coordinating property of substituted chalcones, the therapeutic, catalytic, chemosensing and photosensitizing potential of various metal-chalcone complexes, their structural features and structure activity relationships (SARs) have been highlighted. Further, the understanding of coordination mode, their stoichiometric characteristics, and mode of action(s), this review may be helpful for medicinal and bioinorganic chemists to design and develop novel, more potent, safe, selective and cost-effective chalcone-based coordination compounds for diverse biomedical applications.","Review of the molecular mechanisms of Ganoderma lucidum triterpenoids: Ganoderic acids A, C2, D, F, DM, X and Y.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035236,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"Ganoderma lucidum is a multi-purpose plant medicine that is homologous to functional food. The most attractive properties of G. lucidum are its immunomodulatory and antitumour activities, which are mainly attributed to the following two major active components: G. lucidum polysaccharides and G. lucidum triterpenoids (GLTs). GLTs are effective as supplemental therapies and improve health when combined with other medications to treat hepatitis, fatigue syndrome, and prostate cancer. However, research investigating the mechanism and application of G. lucidum or GLTs in the treatment of diseases remains preliminary in terms of both the utilization efficacy and product type. This review offers comprehensive insight into the pharmacological activities of GLTs and their potential applications in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Specifically, 83 GLTs were selected, and their molecular structures and chemical formulas were described. We also describe 7 ganoderic acids that are currently at different stages of clinical trials (ganoderic acids A, C2, D, F, DM, X and Y).

Among the three VFAs, methanogenic degradation of propionate was the least feasible (57% lower specific methanogenic activity RCH4 and three times longer lag time λ than acetate degradation). At low ammonia concentration, only propionate showed improvement in RCH4 (46%) with supplementation of magnetite. In the ammonia-stressed condition without magnetite, RCH4 decreased by 38-58% and λ increased 2.2-8.8 times for all VFAs; magnetite supplementation significantly alleviated these effects. These results demonstrate that magnetite supplementation effectively increases methanogenic degradation of the VFAs even under ammonia-stressed conditions. 16S metagenomic sequencing revealed that distinctive methanogenic consortia were active in the different combinations of substrate, ammonia and magnetite. Alkaliphilus, Hyphomonadaceae SWB02 and Clostridia DTU014, Clostridia D8A-2, Christensenellaceae R-7 group and Rikenellaceae DMER64 were identified as potential syntrophic bacteria that can establish magnetite-mediated direct electron transfer with methanogens (Methanosaeta concilii, Methanosaeta harundinacea, Methanolinea tarda, Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanosarcina spp.) during methanogenic degradation of VFAs.

For identification of children with SPD, accurate classification rates from a combination of DTI microstructural (FA, MD, AD, and RD), connectivity (TD) and connectomic (ED) metrics with different machine learning algorithms - including naïve Bayes, random forest, support vector machine, and neural networks - were determined. In voxel-wise analysis, children with SPD had lower FA, ED, and TD but higher MD and RD compared to TDC - predominantly in posterior white matter tracts including posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, and posterior body and splenium of corpus callosum. In stepwise penalized logistic regression, the only independent variable distinguishing children with SPD from TDC was the average TD in the splenium (p < 0.001). Among different combinations of machine learning algorithms and DTI/connectivity metrics, random forest models using tract-based TD yielded the highest accuracy in classification of SPD - 77.5% accuracy, 73.8% sensitivity, and 81.6% specificity. Our findings demonstrate impaired microstructural and connectivity/connectomic integrity in children with SPD, predominantly in posterior white matter tracts, and with reduced TD of the splenium of corpus callosum as the most distinctive pattern. Applying machine learning algorithms, these connectivity metrics can be used to devise novel imaging biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders.",Barriers to seeking help for physicians with substance use disorder: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035230,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 05 24,Substance use disorders (SUD) might concern as many as 8-15% of physicians.

This latter process leads to elevated Hg concentrations in fish and may thus induce toxicity. Maternal transfer of bioaccumulated contaminants to offspring is a suggested mechanism of impaired reproductive success in fish. The purpose of this study was to assess the toxicity potential of Hg during maternal transfer in Yellow Perch from Lake Saint-Pierre (Quebec, Canada) using a subcellular partitioning approach. We also evaluated potential protective effects of selenium, as this element has been shown to alleviate Hg toxicity through sequestration. A customized subcellular partitioning protocol was used to separate liver and gonad of Yellow Perch into various subcellular fractions. Results show that, in the liver, MeHg was primarily (51%) associated to the subcellular fraction containing cytosolic enzymes. Furthermore, 23% and 15% of MeHg was found in hepatic and gonadal mitochondria, respectively, suggesting that Yellow Perch is not effectively detoxifying this metal. There was also a strong relationship (R2 = 0.73) between MeHg bioaccumulation in the liver and MeHg concentrations in gonadal mitochondria, which corroborates the potential risk linked to MeHg maternal transfer. On the other hand, we also found that selenium might have a protective effect on Hg toxicity at a subcellular level. In fact, Se:Hg molar ratios in subcellular fractions were systematically above 1 in all tissues and fractions examined, which corresponds to the suggested protective threshold. This study provides the first assessment of subcellular Se:Hg molar ratios in fish. Since early developmental stages in aquatic biota are particularly sensitive to Hg, this study represents a step forward in understanding the likelihood for toxic effects in wild fish through maternal transfer.","Comparative study on the pretreatment of algae-laden water by UV/persulfate, UV/chlorine, and UV/H2O2: Variation of characteristics and alleviation of ultrafiltration membrane fouling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035198,Water research,2019 05 18,"In this study, ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes (UV-AOPs) including UV/persulfate (UV/PS), UV/chlorine, and UV/H2O2 were employed to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling during the treatment of algae-laden water. The results show that UV/PS pretreatment exhibited the best performance on fouling control, followed by the UV/H2O2 pretreatment. The fouling mitigation performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose. However, UV/chlorine pretreatment aggravated membrane fouling, and the irreversible fouling resistance increased by five times compared with that of raw water. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the algae-laden solution was reduced after UV/PS pretreatment, while either UV/chlorine or UV/H2O2 pretreatment had little influence on the DOC of feed water. UV/PS and UV/H2O2 pretreatments were effective in the degradation of fluorescent compounds, thus reducing the deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface. Additionally, the decreased concentration of hydrophobic organics, algal cells, and debris in feed water after UV/PS pretreatment was also contributed to the fouling alleviation. The aggravated irreversible fouling after UV/chlorine pretreatment was probably ascribed to the increased accumulation of hydrophobic fractions in the membrane pores. Modeling result indicates that membrane fouling during the filtration of raw algae-laden water was dominated by intermediate blocking and cake filtration mechanisms. Both UV/PS and UV/H2O2 pretreatments transformed the combined fouling mechanism into standard blocking, while UV/chlorine pretreatment aggravated the pore blocking in the initial filtration period.",Recovery of gallium from wafer fabrication industry wastewaters by Desferrioxamine B and E using reversed-phase chromatography approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035197,Water research,2019 05 18,"Gallium (Ga) is a critical element in developing renewable energy generation and energy efficient systems. The supply of Ga is at risk and needed recycling technologies for its availability in future. This study demonstrated the recovery of Ga3+ from low gallium concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewaters using the siderophores desferrioxamine B (DFOB) and desferrioxamine E (DFOE). The complexation of Ga3+ by DFOB and DFOE was through hydroxamate group as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations. The high selectivity of DFOB/E towards Ga3+ was observed due to the formation of highly stable complex. Indeed, due to the formation of such high stability complex, the DFOB and DFOE were able to successfully complex 100% Ga in the two different process water from wafer fabrication industry. For the recovery of the siderophores, a high rate of decomplexation of Ga (>90%) was achieved upon addition of 6 times excess of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at pH of 3.5. More than 95% of Ga-DFOB and Ga-DFOE complex were recovered with purity (% of Ga moles in comparison to total moles of metals) of 69.8 and 92.9%, respectively by application of a C18 reversed-phase chromatography column. This study, for the first time, demonstrated a technical solution to the recovery of Ga3+ from the low concentrated wastewater based on siderophores and reversed-phase chromatography.

This study investigated the prevalence, types, genetic elements, and potential for transmission of S. aureus by these engineered systems. Synchronized sampling events at two wastewater treatment plants were conducted with isolates of S. aureus obtained by a selective enrichment method using acriflavine that suppressed Staphylococcus epidermidis growth. DNA was extracted from a subset of the S. aureus isolates, checked by PCR to assure the absence of S. epidermidis, and sequenced to determine the multilocus sequence type, spa type, and carriage of the methicillin resistance and Panton-Valentine leukocidin genetic elements. Sequences were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism differences in pairwise comparison of isolates. There were two dominant S. aureus clonal complexes identified in the isolates, one commonly identified as hospital-related (CC5) and one community-related (CC8). Both types of isolates were found at both treatment facilities, even though only one facility had significant hospital sewage inputs. The presence of S. aureus persisted through treatment, with some isolates recovered from the final processes showing genetic diversity. The presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genetic element was greater than the 1-5% expected from global reports. Our results suggest that treatment provides an opportunity for genetic shift, while the persistence and release of evolved strains of S. aureus may provide an environmentally relevant pathway to new hosts in the environment.",Diffusion behavior of humic acid during desalination with air gap and water gap membrane distillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035195,Water research,2019 05 18,"Desalination and water reuse are important means to resolve local water scarcity and security issues worldwide where membrane distillation (MD) may be part of a solution. Natural organic matter and in particular, humic acids (HA), are widely present in water supplies to be treated but exhibit little understood behavior to diffuse through MD membranes into permeate. In this work, air gap (AGMD) and water gap (WGMD) were utilized to study HA behavior in MD using seawater and synthetic water over a range of typical MD temperatures, flow rates and membrane types. HA diffusion was first shown with seawater feed then on synthetic solutions at all process conditions. While electrical conductivity rejection was always above than 99%, HA rejection showed values of 33% and 90% for AGMD and 68% and 93% for WGMD with seawater and synthetic water, respectively. Analytical techniques were used to perform a preliminary organic matter characterization in permeate, obtaining clear differences between the feed and permeate HA property. Compared to hydrophobic membranes, uniquely oleophobic membranes inhibit HA diffusion suggesting hydrophobic surface diffusion of HA through the membrane. HA flux as well as potential undesirable effects of the organic matter in permeate should be considered for MD applications.",Effects of copper ions on removal of nutrients from swine wastewater and on release of dissolved organic matter in duckweed systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035194,Water research,2019 05 18,"High concentration of Cu2+ in swine wastewater raises concerns about its potential adverse effects on nutrient removal by aquatic plants like duckweed. In this work, the effects of copper ions on nutrient removal and release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in duckweed systems. Results showed that the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) and total phosphorus (TP) increased at 0.1-1.0 mg/L of Cu2+, while dropped at 2.0-5.0 mg/L of Cu2+. A novel kinetic model in which Cu2+ was taken into account was then developed which was used to optimize Cu2+ concentration at 0.96 mg/L for nutrient removal in duckweed systems. NADH, detected in DOM by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions, so it played an important role on the decrease of Cu2+ concentrations in duckweed systems. The principle component analysis (PCA) showed that the dominant DOM were lower molecular weight compounds at 1.0 mg/L of Cu2+ and higher molecular weight compounds at 2.0-5.0 mg/L of Cu2+. The bonds of CH (humic-like), NO (NO3-) and ArH (tyrosine) in DOM were responsible for not only the fastest binding with Cu2+ from the result of the two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D-FTIR-CoS) but also the variations of DOM conformations at a critical concentration of 0.5 mg/L Cu2+ from the perturbation correlation moving window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) analysis. These findings lead to a better understanding on the environmental behaviors and mechanisms of Cu2+ in duckweed systems.",Settling characteristics of nonspherical porous sludge flocs with nonhomogeneous mass distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035193,Water research,2019 05 18,"The paper reports on the development of an advanced Lagrangian particle tracking model of sludge flocs that takes into account its nonspherical shape, the internal porosity and permeability, as well as the nonhomogenous mass distribution. The floc shapes, sizes and free settling velocities are determined based on the experimental measurement of settling sludge flocs originating from a wastewater treatment plant. Based on the floc shape characterization, a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid is selected as the modelled sludge particle. In order to determine the main particle characteristics, e.g. the internal porosity, the density and the flow permeability, a Lagrangian particle tracking model is developed based on Brenner's drag model for a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid and a buoyancy force model for a porous particle. The model is implemented for numerical simulations of the free settling process. The obtained floc characteristics are presented in the form of a two-part polynomial fitting curve, which can be used to model floc characteristics. The values of settling velocities of flocs computed by the model show very good agreement with experimental results. Futhermore, as the internal structure of a floc is seldom uniform, the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is considered, influencing the rotational and translational motions of the settling flocs. The nonhomogeneous mass distribution is introduced into the floc settling model. The parametric analyses of different barycentre offsets and shear rates are performed, and their influences on the free settling velocity are evaluated. The presented modelling approach can also be applied to flocculent settling of alum and other flocs in drinking water treatment plants. The developed Lagrangian model is suitable for use as a point source within the framework of Eulerian flow computations, and is solved as a two-phase flow model with a suitable Computational Fluid Dynamics code.","Comment on ""Explaining virtual water trade: A spatial-temporal analysis of the comparative advantage of land, labor and water in China,"" published by Zhao et al.

CRL sorption behavior was evaluated as a function of pH, enzyme concentration, temperature and ionic strength. As the immobilized lipase was used for the catalytic esterification of oleic acid, its resistance to solvents and thermal stability were evaluated. CRL adsorption increased by increasing temperature, and with higher pH, reaching a maximum at pH 7.0. Immobilization increased lipase stability at 40 °C by more than 80% when compared to the free enzyme. Moreover, immobilized CRL showed high stability in the presence of tert-butanol, which prevents premature deactivation of the enzyme caused by alcohols during the reaction. Immobilization of CRL increased the oleic acid conversion rate. Our results suggest that biochar is a highly promising material for the immobilization of CRL lipase for the catalytic production of esters.","Mutation analysis of common deafness-causing genes among 506 patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss from Wenzhou city, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035178,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2019 05 27,"The frequency and spectrum of mutations in deafness-causing genes differs significantly according to the ethnic population and region under investigation.

This exposure results in considerable ROS generation leading to oxidative stress, the primary response of the plants under heavy metal stress. Withania somnifera is a reputed Indian medicinal plant in Ayurveda, having various pharmacological activities due to the presence of withanolides. The present study deals with the understanding endurance of oxidative stress caused by heavy metal exposure and its management through antioxidant partners in synchronization with secondary metabolites in W. somnifera. The quantitative assessment of enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants revealed significant participation of ascorbate-glutathione-α-tocopherol triad in ROS management. Higher activities of glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) resulted in glutathione and ascorbate accumulation. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and peroxidase (POD) were contributed considerably in ROS homeostasis maintenance. In-situ localization and assays related to ROS generation/scavenging revealed key management of ROS status under Cd stress. Higher antioxidative and reducing power activity attributed to the tolerance capability to the plant. Increased expression of withanolide biosynthetic pathway genes such as WsHMGR, WsDXS, WsDXR and WsCAS correlated with enhanced withanolides. The present study indicated the crucial role of the ascorbate-glutathione-α-tocopherol triad in co-ordination with withanolide biosynthesis in affording the oxidative stress, possibly through a cross-talk between the antioxidant machinery and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The knowledge may be useful in providing the guidelines for developing abiotic stress resistance in plants using conventional and molecular approaches.",FLT3 ligand plasma levels have no impact on outcomes after allotransplant in acute leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035172,Cytokine,2019 06 07,This study was designed to assess the impact on outcomes of early soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand concentrations (sFLc) in patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).,Reliability of the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test in young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035171,Physical therapy in sport : official journal of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine,2019 06 11,"To analyze the reliability indicators of CKCUEST, and to investigate how many sessions are necessary to find a stable score.","Biosafety assessment of graphene nanosheets on leaf ultrastructure, physiological and yield traits of Capsicum annuum L. and Solanum melongena L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035170,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"Due to limited knowledge of graphene nanosheets (GNS) on phyto-biological studies, GNS was sprayed to pepper and eggplants during the seasons 2016 and 2017 at doses 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 GNS g L-1 to assess their biosafety on leaf ultrastructure and agro-physiological traits. GNS was localized on plastids, cell walls and intercellular spaces of both plants. GNS-sprayed peppers characterized by giant chloroplasts with large starch granules and increment of mitochondrial number adjacent to chloroplasts. Whilst, chloroplast ultrastructure of GNS-treated eggplants appeared to be ellipsoidal-shaped with few normal sized-starch granules compared to control. The localization of GNS inside chloroplast may be activated photosynthetic pigments; thereby stimulation of fructose, sucrose and starch was displayed. The rising of hydrogen peroxide of GNS-treated leaves had beneficial role on triggering the activity of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. Furthermore, the reduction of hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion reflected the involvement of GNS in induction of antioxidant molecules and superoxide dismutase for modulating cell oxidative status. Thus, the lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage of GNS-treated plants were kept below the baseline of water-sprayed plants. Moreover, the promotions of health-promoting secondary metabolites via GNS aerosol were in close association to exacerbation of phenylalanine ammonialyase actvity. This study conclusively demonstrated that GNS did not have cytotoxic properties in pepper and eggplant cells rather healthy growth and promoted yield in the terms of number of branches plant-1, number of fruits plant-1 and fruit yield (ton hectare-1) were the net result of GNS-induced metabolic regulation of the leaves physiological status."

The question of whether such changes reflect variable transport pathways from a unique source in the western China area was addressed. That is, the SrNd radiogenic isotope composition of modern desert samples do not support the hypothesis of a single dust provenance at higher elevation mountain glaciers by long-distance transport; regional sources also play a significant role. Based on previous studies and the data from this study, the five isotopic regions were divided, which are controlled by the geological characteristics in western China. The results suggest that mineral dust deposited into the high-mountain glaciers originated from the free ice region because of glacier melting and the physical and chemical erosion of rocks from the surrounding mountains by local wind systems. The Pb isotopic data further demonstrated that natural dust is the source of Pb for the high-mountain glaciers of Pan-third pole. These results provide an exhaustive documentation of the isotopic signature of the regional dust reaching the glacier regions.",Fiproles in urban surface runoff: Understanding sources and causes of contamination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035158,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 06 10,"Urban-use pesticides present a unique risk to non-target organisms in surface aquatic systems because impervious pavement facilitates runoff that may lead to serious contamination and ensuing aquatic toxicity. Fipronil is an insecticide used at high rates in urban environments, especially in regions such as California. This compound and its biologically active degradation products have been detected in urban runoff drainage and downstream surface water bodies at concentrations exceeding toxicity thresholds for sensitive aquatic invertebrates, necessitating a better understanding of the runoff sources and causes of this contamination at sites of application. In this study, we evaluated sorption of fipronil, fipronil desulfinyl, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil sulfone in urban dust, soil, and concrete, matrices commonly associated with the perimeter of a residential home. Samples were also collected from five single family homes treated with fipronil in Riverside, California, for five months to determine the occurrence of fipronil and its degradates in runoff water, urban dust, soil, and on concrete surfaces. Statistical analysis was performed to determine which urban matrices contributed more significantly to the contaminant levels in runoff water. Freundlich sorption coefficients for fipronil and its degradation products in dust were 3- to 9-fold greater than their values in soil. Fipronil and its degradates were detected in 100% of runoff samples and their presence was observed in dust, soil, and concrete wipe samples for 153 d after the treatment. Linear regression analysis showed that concrete surfaces were a primary source of all four compounds to runoff, and loose dust on concrete pavement also served as an important contributor. This study represents the first comprehensive investigation of the sources and causes for surface runoff contamination by fipronil and its degradation products. Findings highlight the importance to reduce fipronil residues on concrete surfaces through improved application methods and other mitigation practices.",Distribution and physicochemical properties of particulate matter in swine confinement barns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035157,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Air pollutants accumulated in confined livestock barns could impact the health of animals and staff. Particulate matter (PM) and ammonia (NH3) concentrations are typically high in enclosed livestock houses with weak ventilation. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of PM in different size fractions and the levels of NH3 in a high-rise nursery (HN) barn and a high-rise fattening (HF) barn on a swine farm and to analyse the physicochemical properties of fine PM (PM2.5, PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm). The concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP, PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 100 μm), inhalable PM (PM10, PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm), PM2.5 and NH3 were monitored continuously for 6 d in each barn. The results showed that the concentrations of PM and NH3 varied with position, they were significantly higher inside the barns than outside (P < 0.01) and significantly higher in the forepart than at the rear of the two barns (P < 0.05). In the HF barn, the values of the two parameters were 0.777 ± 0.2 mg m-3 and 26.7 ± 7 mg m-3, respectively, significantly higher than the values observed in the HN barn at all monitored sites (P < 0.05). The PM concentrations increased markedly during feeding time in the two barns. Chemical characteristics analysis revealed that the main sources of PM2.5 in the two barns may have consisted of blowing dust, feed, mineral particles and smoke. In conclusion, the air quality at the forepart was worse than that at the rear of the barns. Activities such as feeding could increase the PM concentrations. The components of PM2.5 in the two barns were probably blowing dust, feed, mineral particles and smoke from outside.",The phenomenological mass transfer kinetics model for Sr2+ sorption onto spheroids primary microplastics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035156,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"In this paper, the equilibrium and mass transfer kinetics of Sr2+ sorption onto 3 types of microplastics, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were investigated. A novel film-pore mass transfer (FPMT) model was developed and used to study the sorption kinetics and mechanisms. This model can be used to describe the external mass transfer (EMT) and the internal mass transfer (IMT) processes and to calculate the diffusion rate. The FPMT model could successfully predict the kinetics data of Sr2+ sorption onto microplastics. The maximum value of the EMT rate achieved at the beginning of sorption was 103 μg g-1·h-1 for PET, 247 μg g-1·h-1for PE, and 854 μg g-1·h-1 for PVC, and then it decreased dramatically with time. The IMT rate was far less than the EMT rate, and decreased slowly with time. The overall sorption rate of Sr2+ onto microplastics was controlled by the external mass transfer step.","Effects of biochar on uptake, acquisition and translocation of silver nanoparticles in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in relation to growth, photosynthetic traits and nutrients displacement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035155,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Rapid development in nanotechnology and incorporation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in wide range of consumer products causing the considerable release of these NPs in the environment, leading concerns for ecosystem safety and plant health. In this study, rice (Oryza sativa) was exposed to AgNPs (0, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 mg L-1) in biochar amended (2 %w/v) and un-amended systems. Exposure of plants to AgNPs alone reduced the root and shoot length, biomass production, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis related physiological parameters as well as macro-and micronutrients in a dose dependent manner. However, in case of biochar amendment, physiological parameters i.e., net photosynthesis rate, maximum photosynthesis rate, CO2 assimilation, dark respiration and stomatal conductance reduced only 16, 6, 7, 3 and 8%, respectively under AgNPs exposure at 1000 mg L-1 dose. Meanwhile, biochar at all exposure level of AgNPs decreased the bioaccumulation of Ag in rice root and shoot tissues, thus alleviated the phyto-toxic effects of NPs on plant growth. Moreover, results showed that biochar reduced the bioavailability of AgNPs by surface complexation, suppressing dissolution and release of toxic Ag+ ions in the growth medium. The presence of biochar at least decreased 2-fold tissue contents of Ag even at highest AgNPs (1000 mg L-1) concentration. These finding suggested that biochar derived from waste biomass resources can be used effectively to prevent the bioaccumulation and subsequent trophic level transfer of emerging Ag nano-pollutant in the environment.",Deposition of mullite in peatlands of southern Poland: Implications for recording large-scale industrial processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035154,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Mullite, a pure aluminosilicate (Al6Si2O13), is a rare natural rock component, known for centuries as a very resistant ceramic material. It is also a common waste product of high-temperature coal combustion that is emitted in quantity from coal-based power stations. The occurrence of mullite in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands located near the Upper Silesia industrial region in southern Poland is described. For the first time, a complete record of mullite deposition in the peat profiles has been obtained by XRD analyses of ashed peat samples. The mullite distribution is compared with records of Hg, Pb and Cu. While mullite is supplied during high temperature processes only, Cu, Pb and Hg show more complex pattern of distribution. Both peat profiles contain elevated amounts of mullite in the time span between ca 1950-1990 with a maximum content in ca 1980. The first appearance (∼1900) of mullite is indicative of the beginning of energy production in coal-based power plants in the region. Mullite is proposed here as an indicator of industrialization in geological records. It is resistant to post-depositional processes, emitted globally, and restricted to large-scale industry.","Particle emissions of Euro VI, EEV and retrofitted EEV city buses in real traffic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035153,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Exhaust emissions from traffic significantly affect urban air quality. In this study, in-traffic emissions of diesel-fueled city buses meeting enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle (EEV) and Euro VI emission limits and the effects of retrofitting of EEV buses were studied on-road by chasing the buses with a mobile laboratory in the Helsinki region, Finland. The average emission factors of particle number (PN), particle mass (PM1) and black carbon mass (BC) were 0.86·1015 1/kgfuel, 0.20 g/kgfuel and 0.10 g/kgfuel, respectively, for EEV buses. For Euro VI buses, the emissions were below 0.5·1015 1/kgfuel (PN), 0.07 g/kgfuel (PM1) and 0.02 g/kgfuel (BC), and the exhaust plume concentrations of these pollutants were close to the background concentrations. The emission factors of PM1 and BC of retrofitted EEV buses were at the level of Euro VI buses, but their particle number emissions varied significantly. On average, the EEV buses were observed to emit the largest amounts of nanocluster aerosol (NCA) (i.e., the particles with size between 1.3 and 3 nm). High NCA emissions were linked with high PN emissions. In general, results demonstrate that advanced exhaust aftertreatment systems reduce emissions of larger soot particles but not small nucleation mode particles in all cases.","Spatiotemporal distribution, source apportionment and ecological risk assessment of PBDEs and PAHs in the Guanlan River from rapidly urbanizing areas of Shenzhen, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035152,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"In this study, nine congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and sixteen congeners of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in water samples to elucidate their spatial distribution, congener profiles, sources and ecological risks in the Guanlan River during both the dry season (DS) and the wet season (WS). The concentration of Σ9PBDE ranged from 58.40 to 186.35 ng/L with an average of 115.72 ng/L in the DS, and from 8.20 to 37.80 ng/L with an average of 22.15 ng/L in the WS. Meanwhile, the concentration of Σ16PAHs was ranged from 121.80 to 8371.70 ng/L with an average of 3271.18 ng/L in the DS and from 1.85 to 7124.25 ng/L with an average of 908.11 ng/L in the WS. The concentrations of PBDEs and PAHs in the DS were significantly higher than those in the WS, probably due to the dilution of the river during the rainy season. Moreover, the spatial distribution of pollutants revealed decreasing trend in the concentration from upstream to downstream and almost identical pattern was observed during both seasons. The source apportionment suggested that penta-BDE and to some extent octa-BDE commercial products were major sources of PBDEs in the study area. However, the sources of PAHs were mainly comprised of fossil fuels and biomass burning, followed by the petroleum products and their mixtures. The results of the ecological risk assessment indicated PBDEs contamination posed high ecological risks, while PAHs exhibited low or no ecological risks in the study area. Consistent with the environmental levels, the ecological risks of pollutants were relatively lower in the WS, compared to that in the DS. The results from this study would provide valuable baseline data and technical support for policy makers to protect the ecological environment of the Guanlan River.",Transformation of gaseous 2-bromophenol on clay mineral dust and the potential health effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035151,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Iron-bearing clays are ubiquitously distributed as mineral dusts in the atmosphere. Bromophenols were reported as the major products from thermal decomposition of the widely used brominated flame retardants (BFRs). However, little information is available for the reactivity of iron associated with mineral dusts to interact with the atmospheric bromophenols and the subsequent toxic effects. Herein, three common clay minerals (montmorillonite, illite and kaolinite) were used to simulate mineral dusts, and the reactions with gaseous 2-bromophenol were systematically investigated under environmentally relevant atmospheric conditions. Our results demonstrate that structural Fe(III) in montmorillonite and Fe(III) from iron oxide in illite mediated the dimerization of 2-bromophenol to form hydroxylated polybrominated biphenyl and hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether. The surface reaction is favored to occur at moisture environment, since water molecules formed complex with 2-bromophenol and the reaction intermediates via hydrogen bond to significantly lower the reaction energy and promote the dimerization reaction. More importantly, the formed dioxin-like products on clay mineral dust increased the toxicity of the particles to A549 lung cell by decreasing cell survival and damaging cellular membrane and proteins. The results of this study indicate that not only mineral dust itself but also the associated surface reaction should be fully considered to accurately evaluate the toxic effect of mineral dust on human health.",Phosphate treatment alleviated acute phytotoxicity of heavy metals in sulfidic Pb-Zn mine tailings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035150,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"Phytostabilization of sulfidic PbZn tailing landscapes may be one of interim options of tailings management, but which is limited by acute phytotoxicity of heavy metals in the tailings. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of soluble phosphate (i.e., K2HPO4) in immobilizing soluble Pb, Cd and Zn and lowering their acute phytotoxicity. The addition of soluble phosphate improved the growth of native plants Acacia chisholmii and survival rate of A. ligulata, where the latter exhibited 100% survival rate. This was in contrast to effects of conventional organic amendment in the tailings on metal solubility (e.g., elevated metal levels in porewater) and plant survival (e.g., only 42%). Organic amendment with mulch did not lower the levels of water-soluble Cd, Pb and Zn and their concentrations in plant tissues after 56 days of plant growth in the treatment. In contrast, the tailings amended with K2HPO4 significantly decreased metal concentrations in the porewater and plant tissues by about 80-92% and 56-88%, respectively. The metal immobilization by phosphate was due to the formation of insoluble or sparingly soluble metal (Pb, Cd and Zn)-phosphate minerals in the tailings with circumneutral pH conditions, as revealed by using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microanalyses. The reduced metal concentrations in roots and shoots of Acacia species after direct root contact with the K2HPO4 amended tailings suggested that metals (i.e., Pb, Cd and Zn) were effectively immobilized by the phosphate treatment of the tailings. These findings indicate that addition of high dosage of soluble phosphate may provide a low cost option to treat sulfidic PbZn tailings for rapid phytostabilization of the tailings surface, as an interim option to manage environmental risks of sulfidic PbZn tailings."

Two common methods to describe bending bone fractures in the anthropological literature include the application of morphology nomenclature and describing characteristic fracture morphology. A nomenclature descriptor of blunt trauma, the butterfly fracture, is commonly used to describe broken long bones. In this paper, a case study of a fractured long bone in a pedestrian vehicle accident is used to highlight the complex interplay of factors involved in bone fracture formation. The application of a butterfly fracture pattern in trauma analysis is useful in establishing the bending direction of a bone, in identifying failure modes, and is valuable in teaching. Yet, butterfly fracture characteristics need to be examined in 3-dimensions for diagnosis of modes of failure, tension, shear and compression, and even then, the bending direction of a broken bone may not provide a reliable indicator of the point of impact (POI); this is especially true when a priori knowledge of the injury is unknown. Common fracture nomenclature, such as oblique, transverse and/or comminuted, as well as eponyms, are medical descriptions of an injury which are impractical to use for interpreting a broken bone from fleshed or skeletonized remains, in establishing a POI and in evaluating total bone trauma (TBT). The examination ofcharacteristic features on the surface of a broken bone associated with the modes of failure is the best approach for establishing the bending direction of a long bone.",Development and application of a high throughput one-pot extraction protocol for quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis of phospholipids in serum and lipoprotein fractions in normolipidemic and dyslipidemic subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035135,"Journal of chromatography.

Their size is tunable in the range from 875 nm to 60 nm by adjusting the amount of PVP during synthesis at elevated temperature. These spheres are obtained by using resorcinol and formaldehyde as carbon precursors, ethylene diamine (EDA) as nitrogen source and basic catalyst, and PVP as stabilizer and an additional source of nitrogen dopant. A synergistic effect is shown between (i) elevated temperature that facilitates the formation of a large number of small polymeric nuclei and (ii) varying amount of PVP that controls the growth of formed nuclei by hindering polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde. The elevated temperature synthesis not only produces monodispersed carbon spheres but also eliminates the need for hydrothermal treatment that generally requires high-pressure autoclave vessel. The nitrogen content increases from 3.0 wt% to 5.0% with increasing PVP amount. Besides nitrogen originating from ethylene diamine, an additional amount of doped nitrogen in carbon spheres is supplied by PVP during its decomposition. The resulting carbon spheres were subjected to the post-synthesis CO2 activation in order to improve their structural properties. The surface area of activated carbon spheres increased almost twice from (516 m2/g-581 m2/g) to (1010 m2/g-1060 m2/g). A significant enhancement of microporosity as well as presence of nitrogen species in activated carbon spheres resulted in high CO2 uptake at ambient temperatures. The tunable size, high microporosity, nitrogen doping and cost-effective synthesis make these carbon spheres attractive for a variety of uses ranging from adsorption, catalysis, electrode materials to biomedical applications.",Studies on the interaction of antibiotic drug rifampin with DNA and influence of bivalent metal ions on binding affinity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035130,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 05 24,"In this paper, the interaction between rifampin, a known antibiotic used against tuberculosis, and DNA helix is investigated by applying multiple biophysical and molecular modelling approaches in an aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and 5. It was proved that the fluorescence quenching of labeled probe DNA by rifampin is a result of the complex formation of rifampin in groove of DNA. Binding parameters were calculated using the logarithmic Hill equation to provide a quantitative term of the binding affinity between rifampin and DNA sites. The resulting ΔH0 = -122.76 ± 0.07 kJ/mol and ΔS0 = -308.19 ± 238.78 J/mol K confirms the role of the Van der Waals' forces and hydrogen bonding in the rifampin-DNA complexation. Furthermore, the influence of bivalent metal ions on the binding affinity was resulted in order of Cu(II) > Ca(II) > Co(II) > Zn(II).",Spectrophotometric strategies for the analysis of binary combinations with minor component based on isoabsorptive point's leveling effect: An application on ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide in their recently delivered co-formulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035129,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 05 24,"Comparative study of the spectrophotometric strategies utilizing the isoabsorptive point present in overlapped absorption spectra of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide in their recently delivered co-formulation, was presented. Four spectrophotometric approaches were developed, dependent on the determination of the leveling effect of isoabsorptive point in their zero order absorption spectra or its manipulated form ratio spectra as it retains an isosbestic point. The proposed strategy was based on determination of the total concentrations of the proposed drugs at iso-point, either via zero order or ratio spectra, while one of the recommended methods determined the concentration of the major component, so the concentration of the minor component was obtained by differentiation. The first, second and third methods are utilizing isoabsorptive point at zero order absorption spectrum to quantify total concentration of the cited component, while the major component could be selectively determined using either absorbance at its maxima (IsoPD0-D0max), or area under the peak method (IsoPD0-AUC), or first derivative technique (IsoPD0-D1). The fourth method is ratio manipulated isoabsorptive point in ratio spectrum, namely the amplitude modulation method (AM), using an unified regression equation for the total and major component concentrations, separately. The four methods were applied practically for the analysis of the binary mixtures of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) and fluocinolone acetonide (FLU) in a recently otic solution form in challengeable ratio12:1respectively, without the need of any previous stages such as separation, dilution or standard addition. The methods were successfully validated as per ICH guidelines. The outcomes data gained from those submitted techniques were statistically assimilated with official ones. However, no radical differences were noticed.",Rapid and non-destructive analysis for the identification of multi-grain rice seeds with near-infrared spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035128,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 05 24,"The rapid and non-destructive discriminant analysis of rice seeds has great significance for large-scale agriculture. Using near-infrared (NIR) diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy with partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a variety identification method of multi-grain rice seeds was developed. The equidistant combination method was adopted for large-range wavelength screening. A step-by-step phase-out method was proposed to eliminate interference wavelengths and improve the predicted effect. The optimal wavelength model was a combination of 54 wavelengths within 808-974 nm of the short-NIR region. One type of pure rice variety (Y Liangyou 900) was used for identification (negative). Positive samples included the other four pure varieties and contamination of Y Liangyou 900 by the above four varieties. The recognition-accuracy rates for positive, negative and total validation samples reached 93.1%, 95.1%, and 94.3%, respectively. In the long-NIR region, the local optimal wavelength model was a combination of 49 wavelengths within 1188-1650 nm, and the recognition-accuracy rates for positive, negative and total validation samples were 90.3%, 94.1%, and 92.5%, respectively. Results confirmed the feasibility of NIR spectroscopy for variety identification of multi-grain rice seeds. The proposed two discrete-wavelength models located in the short- and long-NIR regions can provide valuable reference to a dedicated spectrometer."

In particular, PAHs were more resistant to degradation, and their persistence could have deleterious impacts on the sediment ecosystem. This study aimed to evaluate the microbial recovery of coastal sediments from the HSOS by analyzing the structure and diversity of the microbial community and its functional contribution to PAHs degradation. High-throughput sequencing on the MiSeq platform was conducted using tidal flat sediments collected in 2014 and 2016 from the area contaminated by the HSOS. The microbial recovery was evaluated by various diversity factors, including microbial composition and structure and functional diversity based on PICRUSt analysis. The abundance of microbial taxa associated with TPH degradation was higher in 2014 than that in 2016, but the taxa associated with PAHs degradation were similar between years. These results are consistent with the dynamics of microbes associated with the fate of pollutants, and they also showed similar tendency in functional profiles. That is, even if the pollutants are completely degraded, the microbial community has not yet completely recovered from the HSOS. The evaluation of microbial ecosystems in contaminated environments should consider both the fate of pollutants and the dynamics of microbial species that make functional contributions to the degradation of pollutants.","Exposure to ambient particulate matter air pollution, blood pressure and hypertension in children and adolescents: A national cross-sectional study in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035113,Environment international,2019 05 19,"Air pollution has been associated with elevated blood pressure in adults.

Additionally, studies suggest an essential role for these cellular structures in the gut. Here, we review recent data on interactions between MT and various arms of the immune system and propose a model that represents gut MTs as potential targets for immunotherapy, and specifically for oral immunotherapy.",Cytoplasmic R-peptide of murine leukemia virus envelope protein negatively regulates its interaction with the cell surface receptor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035110,Virology,2019 05 13,"Cytoplasmic tails of envelope (Env) glycoproteins of many retroviruses inhibit their membrane fusion activity. The cytoplasmic 16-amino acid peptide of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MLV) Env protein, called the R-peptide, also inhibits the membrane fusion activity of the Env protein. However, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we found that R-peptide-containing Env protein of E-MLV binds to the cell surface receptor cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) with weaker affinity than R-peptide-truncated Env protein. Consistent with this result, R-peptide-containing Env protein had less efficient inhibition of E-MLV vector infection than R-peptide-truncated Env protein. R-peptide truncation has been reported to induce conformational change in the surface subunit of E-MLV Env protein that interacts with the receptor. Taken together, our findings indicate that R-peptide truncation induces conformational change in the receptor-binding domain of the E-MLV Env protein and facilitates the Env-receptor interaction.",Negative life events as triggers on suicide attempt in rural China: a case-crossover study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035109,Psychiatry research,2019 05 28,"This study aims to investigate the potential triggering of negative life events (NLEs) on suicide attempt in rural China. A case-crossover design was used to study 1200 suicide attempters aged 15-70 years. NLEs were assessed by a modification of Paykel's Interview for Recent Life Events. NLEs had significant triggering effects on the day of and month of suicide attempt. Marriage/love, family/home, and friend/relationship were the types of NLEs found to trigger suicide attempt when occurring on the day and month of suicide attempt. Specifically, increased risk of suicide attempt was associated with quarreling with a partner or family member on the day and month of suicide attempt. Being disappointed in a love affair, fighting with a partner, family poverty and loss of face during the month of attempts were linked to increase odds of suicide attempt. Further, when month of suicide attempt was assigned as the case period, the impact of NLEs on suicide attempt was greater among those who were younger and without mental disorders. These findings provide knowledge of the triggering of NLEs on suicide attempt, especially among the young and those without mental disorders. Further, family conflicts should be a greater focus of attention in suicide prevention.",A novel approach to medical radioisotope production using inverse kinematics: A successful production test of the theranostic radionuclide 67Cu.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035108,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 21,"A novel method for the production of important medical radioisotopes has been developed. The approach is based on performing the nuclear reaction in inverse kinematics, namely sending a heavy-ion beam of appropriate energy on a light target (e.g. H, d, He) and collecting the isotope of interest. In this work, as a proof-of-concept, we studied the production of the theranostic radionuclide 67Cu (T1/2 = 62 h) via the reaction of a 70Zn beam at 15 MeV/nucleon with a hydrogen gas target. The 67Cu radionuclide alongside other coproduced isotopes, was collected after the gas target on an aluminum catcher foil and their radioactivity was measured by off-line γ-ray analysis. After 36 h post irradiation, apart from the product of interest 67Cu, the main radioimpurity coming from the 70Zn + p reaction was 69mZn (T1/2 = 13.8 h), which can be reduced by further radio-cooling. Moreover, along with the radionuclide of interest produced in inverse kinematics, the production of additional radioisotopes is possible by making use of the forward-focused neutrons from the reaction and allowing them to interact with a secondary target. A preliminary successful test of this concept was realized in the present study. The main requirement to obtain activities appropriate for preclinical studies is the development of high-intensity heavy-ion primary beams.",Extraction of carrier-free 99Mo by ionic liquids from acid solutions: A model of seaborgium (Sg) experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035107,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"A new approach for extraction of 99Mo tracer as a lighter homolog of Seaborgium (Sg) by three different the ionic liquids are studied.

Boiss is one of the most important endemic medicinal plants in Iran, which has three main terpenoid compounds including ferutinin, stylosin and tschimgine. Ferutinin is the strongest natural phytoestrogen that has agonistic activity on estrogen receptors, particularly α-receptors. To determine the amount of ferutinin in F. ovina roots, we firstly used HPLC-UV method. In the HPLC method, the resolution of ferutinin from the two other compounds, stylosin and tshimgine, was poor. Therefore, we decided to use qHNMR method for simultaneous quantification of ferutinin, stylosin and tshimgine in the plant roots. Quantitative 1H-NMR (qHNMR) was carried out based on the relative ratio of signal integration of each compound [(H-1 for tschimgine (δH 4.94-5.03), OCH3 for stylosin (δH 3.8), and H-9 for ferutinin (δH 5.58)] to certain amount of the internal standard dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2). The qHNMR method showed good precision (intra-day RSD ≤ 2.31%, inter-day RSD ≤ 2.72%), linearity (in the ranges of 1.3-10.41, 1.2-9.7 and 1.1-9.02 mg/mL with correlation coefficients at 0.9991), repeatability (RSD ≤ 2.99%) and stability (RSD ≤ 2.4%) for the quantification of the compounds.

Herein, we have presented an efficient and economical strategy for the removal and recycling of hazardous Cd ions using microalgae cells as the bioreactors. Remarkably, the green bio-platform for the bioproduction of CdSe nanoparticles (NPs) was developed depending on their orderly regulated and sustainable cellular environment. The biofabricated CdSe NPs manifested favorable photoluminescence properties, and presented well monodispersed spherical morphology and certain crystallinity structure with mean size of smaller than 7 nm. Especially, the fluorescence ""turn off"" sensing system based on the CdSe NPs was established to detect Hg2+. The nanosensor enables the quantitative analyses of Hg2+ with a linear range of 0-2.0 μM and a detection limit of 0.021 μM. Furthermore, it was preliminarily speculated that the reducing biomolecules in the algae cells could be involved in the formation of CdSe NPs. This work not only provides new insights into the removal and recycling of hazardous Cd ions, but also brings a promising route for biosynthesis of CdSe NPs.","The relationship between stress and stigma, somatization and parental self-efficacy among fathers of adolescents with developmental disabilities in the Bedouin community in Israel.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035091,Research in developmental disabilities,2019 05 31,"Although children across the world experience Developmental Disabilities, most research on DD has been conducted using Western cultural perspectives and has primarily focused on mothers, leaving significant gaps in the literature.

Besides, the relationship between somatization and stress was examined in this study, as it is mediated by the sense of stigma, as well as the intensity of the mediation of the knowledge of shame, between paternal self-efficacy and stress.",Effects of body weight gain on insulin and lipid metabolism in equines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035090,Domestic animal endocrinology,2019 05 16,"The objective of this study was to illuminate the changes in serum NEFA concentrations during a combined glucose-insulin test (CGIT) and basal serum triacylglycerides (TGs) with increasing BW in Shetland ponies and warmblood horses. Therefore, basal blood samples were taken during fasting and a CGIT was performed in 19 healthy equines (10 Shetland ponies, 9 warmblood horses) (t0). After one (t1) and two (t2) year(s) of receiving 200% of their maintenance metabolizable energy requirement, procedures were repeated in the same equines. Sixteen of 19 equines had no signs of insulin dysregulation confirmed by CGIT. Basal plasma glucose concentrations increased in ponies (P = 0.001) when comparing t0 and t2, and basal serum insulin concentrations increased in ponies (P = 0.009) and horses (P = 0.024) from t0 to t2. Basal serum NEFA concentrations increased in ponies comparing t0 and t2 (P = 0.01). During CGIT, NEFA levels dropped until reaching a nadir and subsequently recovered until reaching basal concentrations. The minimum serum NEFA value did not change over time in ponies or horses. However, a strong correlation between basal serum NEFA concentrations and the percentage drop to minimum NEFA levels was found in ponies. Two of three equines (one horse and one pony) graded as insulin-dysregulated suffered from laminitis at t2. The serum NEFA concentrations of these animals had a delay in recovery of the minimum NEFA levels. Basal serum TG levels did not change with BW gain, and no breed differences were observed. In conclusion, serum NEFA concentrations are useful parameters during CGIT to detect insulin dysregulation in equines. Thus, further investigation should be focused on lipid metabolism during insulin dysregulation.",Baicalin alleviated APEC-induced acute lung injury in chicken by inhibiting NF-κB pathway activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035089,International immunopharmacology,2019 05 28,"Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of death in the animal husbandry. Acute lung injury (ALI), most often seen as a part of systemic inflammatory process, characterized by progressive hypoxemia, edema, and neutrophil accumulation in the lung. Baicalin has been reported to inhibit inflammatory response, but its role in ALI remains unknown. The purpose of our study was to determine the protective effect and possible mechanism of baicalin against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC)-induced ALI in chicken. Chickens were conditioned with baicalin 1 week before intratracheally instilled with APEC. Then, chickens were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation 12 h later and the lung tissues were collected for examining histopathological changes, wet/dry (W/D) ratio, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. The results showed that pre-treatment of chickens with baicalin significantly alleviated the death rate, histopathological changes in lung tissues. The W/D ratio, MPO activity and production of cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 of lung tissues were also decreased following treatment with baicalin. Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for these effects was attributed to the inhibitory effect of baicalin on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling activation. These data thus support the application of baicalin as a potential medicine for the treatment of E. coli-induced ALI by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway.",SETD7 promotes TNF-α-induced proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle cells in vitro through enhancing NF-κB/CD38 signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035088,International immunopharmacology,2019 05 28,"The inflammation-induced the excessive proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells in the airway wall contribute to airway remodeling in asthma pathogenesis. SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase 7 (SETD7) has emerged as one of the key regulators of inflammation. Yet, the function of SETD7 in regulating inflammation-induced ASM cell proliferation and invasion remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the function of SETD7 in regulating ASM cell proliferation and invasion induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in vitro. Our results showed that SETD7 expression was upregulated in ASM cells stimulated with TNF-α. Silencing SETD7 significantly decreased TNF-α-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration, while SETD7 overexpression exhibited the opposite effect. Notably, silencing SETD7 decreased the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and reduced the expression of CD38 induced by TNF-α. Blocking NF-κB activation significantly abrogated the promotional effect of SETD7 overexpression on CD38 expression. Moreover, overexpression of CD38 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of SETD7 silencing on TNF-α-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration. Overall, these results demonstrate that SETD7 regulates TNF-α-induced ASM cell proliferation and migration through modulation of NF-κB/CD38 signaling, suggesting a potential role of SETD7 in asthma airway remodeling.",Saikosaponin A protects against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035087,International immunopharmacology,2019 05 28,"Ulcerative colitis, one of the most important inflammatory bowel diseases, affects millions of people worldwide.

Saikosaponin A was given 3 d before and during DSS treatment by intragastric administration. The results showed that Saikosaponin A significantly inhibited DSS-induced body weight loss and shortening of colon length. DSS-induced colonic histological changes and MPO activity were also prevented by treatment of Saikosaponin A. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1ß were increased by DSS and dose-dependently inhibited by Saikosaponin A. Furthermore, Saikosaponin A significantly inhibited DSS-induced NF-κB activation and up-regulated the expression of LXRα. Taken together, our results indicated that Saikosaponin A had protective effects against DSS-induced colitis.

Our recent studies have found that pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ) has protective effects against HG-induced oxidative stress damage and apoptosis in HK-2 cells. Nevertheless, whether PPQ has the effect of anti-inflammation and anti-senescence in HK-2 cells remains unclear. Here, we showed that low-dose PPQ treatment (100 nM) downregulates the expression of P16, P21, IL-1β, TNF-α and NF-κB in HG cultured HK-2 cells. A low dose of PPQ also upregulated the protein expression of SOD2, CAT and inhibited the generation of ROS. We also indicated that PPQ affected the activity of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, increased the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and the downstream pathway protein expression of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway (HO-1, NQO-1, GST and GPx-3). When ML385 was added to inhibit the activity of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway, the effects of PPQ on anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation and anti-senescence in HK-2 cells under HG condition were weakened. In conclusion, our results suggest that PPQ could modulate HG-induced inflammation and senescence in HK-2 cells via the inhibition of ROS generation and achieves the protective effects through Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and upregulating the expression of its target protein.","Radiotherapy practice for paediatric brain tumours across Europe and quality assurance initiatives: Current situation, international survey and future perspectives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035085,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 06 03,The aim of the study is to analyse radiotherapy quality assurance (RTQA) processes in the treatment of paediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumours across Europe.,The impacts of agriculture on macroinvertebrate communities: From structural changes to functional changes in Asia's cold region streams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035084,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"The species composition of macroinvertebrate communities is sensitive to environmental changes. However, the influence of human activity over seasons on the functional characteristics of macroinvertebrate communities is poorly understood. To elucidate the effects of agriculture-induced environmental changes on stream ecosystems in cold regions, we conducted a comparative study of an agricultural stream and a forest stream in the Changbai Mountains in northeast China in the summer, autumn, and winter of 2016. Our results showed that agriculture had significant effects on the species and functional composition. Although some sensitive species with ""Swimmer"" and ""Shredder"" traits disappeared, there was a significant increase in species with resilience and resistance traits such as ""Bi- or multivoltine"" in the agricultural stream. This result was attributed to the effects of agricultural practices on habitat stability, heterogeneity of habitats, water quality, and material cycling of the stream ecosystems. Furthermore, functional richness and functional divergence decreased in the agricultural stream, reflecting the strong effects of agricultural disturbance on the resource-use efficiency and functional diversification of communities. In particular, community stability also showed significant decrease in the agricultural stream in the summer, implying a stronger disturbance during this season. Generally, the functional traits and biodiversity of both streams had significant seasonal dynamics. The decrease in biodiversity in the winter indicated that low temperature and freezing are additional critical factors affecting the stability of stream ecosystems in cold regions."

This study aimed to evaluate differences on ATAA-related stress predictions resulting from the elastostatic analysis based on the optimization of arbitrary material properties versus the application of patient-specific material properties determined from ex-vivo biaxial testing. Specifically, the elastostatic analysis relies the on the fact that, if the aortic wall stress does not depend on material properties, the aorta has to be statistically determinate. Finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to a group of nine patients who underwent both angio-CT imaging to reconstruct ATAA anatomies and surgical repair of diseased aorta to collect tissue samples for experimental material testing. Tissue samples cut from excised ATAA rings were tested under equibiaxial loading conditions to obtain experimentally-derived material parameters by fitting stress-strain profiles. FEAs were carried out using both optimized and experimentally-derived material parameters to predict and compare the stress distribution using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Although physiological strains were below yield point (range of 0.08-0.25), elastostatic analysis led to errors on the stress predictions that depended on the type of constitutive model (highest MAPE of 0.7545 for Yeoh model and 0.7683 for Fung model) and ATAA geometry (lowest MAPE of 0.0349 for patient P.7). Elastostatic analysis needs better understanding of its application for determining aneurysm mechanics, and patient-specific material parameters are essential for reliable accurate stress predictions in ATAAs.",Effect of scaffold architecture on cell seeding efficiency: A discrete phase model CFD analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035072,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 09,"Within perfusion cell culture systems, scaffold architecture is able to control important biological parameters such as permeability and fluid flow-induced shear stress. As well, one of the main factors affecting the final fate of this process as well as optimal cell differentiation and proliferation in these systems is initial adhesion of cells to scaffolds. In this study, the effect of scaffold architecture on the adhesion of the cells was computationally investigated. For this purpose, four scaffold models including double-diamond, gyroid, FR-D, and Schwarz-primitive were designed using triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) geometry with a constant porosity of 80%. As well, the inlet velocity of zero to simulate static cell culture and three different inlet velocities for modeling the dynamic cell culture conditions were also selected. The results showed that cell culture efficiency of scaffolds could be changed up to seven times from architecture to architecture under the same conditions. The efficiency of cell culture in scaffolds with tortuous architecture was also reported higher than those with relatively straight microchannels. In terms of culture methods, unlike dynamic cell culture model in which almost a homogeneous cell distribution was observed in static cell culture simulation, more cells adhered, but they had agglomerated in the scaffold entrance regions and had failed to reach all regions. The results of this study shed more light on the selection and design of scaffold architecture for optimal cell culture in tissue engineering.",ASIC modelling of SENSE for parallel MRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035071,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 09,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in medical diagnostics and image reconstruction is a vital part of MRI systems. In Parallel MRI (pMRI), imaging process is accelerated by acquiring less data (undersampled) using multiple receiver coils and offline reconstruction algorithms are applied to reconstruct the fully sampled image. In this research, an Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) model of SENSE (a pMRI algorithm) is presented which reconstructs the image from the undersampled data right on the data acquisition module of the scanner. The proposed ASIC HDL architecture is compared with SENSE reconstruction model implemented on FPGAs, Multi-core CPU and Graphics Processing Units. The proposed architecture is validated using simulated brain data with 8-channel receiver coils and a human cardiac dataset with 20-channel receiver coils. The quality of the reconstructed images is analyzed using Artifact Power (0.0098), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (53.4) and Structured Similarity Index (0.871) which validate the quality of the reconstructed images using the proposed design. The results show that the proposed ASIC HDL SENSE reconstruction model is ∼8000 times faster as compared to the multi-core CPU reconstruction, ∼700 times faster than the GPU implementation and ∼16 times faster as compared to the FPGA reconstruction model. The proposed architecture is suitable for image reconstruction right on the data acquisition system of the scanner and will open new ways for faster image reconstruction on portable MRI scanners.",Biomechanical performance of cranial implants with different thicknesses and material properties: A finite element study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035070,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 09,"This study investigated the effect of implant thickness and material on deformation and stress distribution within different components of cranial implant assemblies. Using the finite element method, two cranial implants, differing in size and shape, and thicknesses (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm, respectively), were simulated under three loading scenarios. The implant assembly model included the detailed geometries of the mini-plates and micro-screws and was simulated using a sub-modeling approach. Statistical assessments based on the Design of Experiment methodology and on multiple regression analysis revealed that peak stresses in the components are influenced primarily by implant thickness, while the effect of implant material is secondary. On the contrary, the implant deflection is influenced predominantly by implant material followed by implant thickness. The highest values of deformation under a 50 N load were observed in the thinnest (1 mm) Polymethyl Methacrylate implant (Small defect: 0.296 mm; Large defect: 0.390 mm). The thinnest Polymethyl Methacrylate and Polyether Ether Ketone implants also generated stresses in the implants that can potentially breach the materials' yield limit. In terms of stress distribution, the change of implant thickness had a more significant impact on the implant performance than the change of Young's modulus of the implant material. The results indicated that the stresses are concentrated in the locations of fixation; therefore, the detailed models of mini-plates and micro-screws implemented in the finite element simulation provided a better insight into the mechanical performance of the implant-skull system.",Development and validation of a geometrically personalized finite element model of the lower ligamentous cervical spine for clinical applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035068,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 09,"Epidemiological and clinical studies show that the magnitude and scope of cervical disease are on the rise, along with the world's rising aging population. From a biomechanical perspective, the cervical spine presents a wide inter-individual variability, where its motion patterns and load sharing strongly depend on the anatomy. This study aimed to first develop and validate a geometrically patient-specific model of the lower cervical spine for clinical applications, and secondly to use the model to investigate the spinal biomechanics associated with typical cervical disorders. Based on measurements of 30 parameters from X-ray radiographs, the 3D geometry of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs (IVDs) were developed, and detailed finite element models (FEMs) of the lower ligamentous cervical spine for 6 subjects were constructed and simulated. The models were then used for the investigation of different grades of IVD alteration. The multi directional range of motion (ROM) results were in alignment with the in-vitro and in-Silico studies confirming the validity of the model. Severe disc alteration (Grade 3) presented a significant decrease in the ROM and intradiscal pressure (flexion, extension, and axial rotation) on the C5-C6 and slightly increase on the adjacent levels. Maximum stress in Annulus Fibrosus (AF) and facet joint forces increased for Grade 3 for both altered and adjacent levels. The novel validated geometrically-personalized FEM presented in this study potentially offers the clinical community a valuable quantitative tool for the noninvasive analyses of the biomechanical alterations associated with cervical spine disease towards improved surgical planning and enhanced clinical outcomes.",Bioengineered analog of stromal cell-derived factor 1α preserves the biaxial mechanical properties of native myocardium after infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035067,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"Adverse remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) after myocardial infarction (MI) results in abnormal tissue biomechanics and impaired cardiac function, often leading to heart failure. We hypothesized that intramyocardial delivery of engineered stromal cell-derived factor 1α analog (ESA), our previously-developed supra-efficient pro-angiogenic chemokine, preserves biaxial LV mechanical properties after MI. Male Wistar rats (n = 45) underwent sham surgery (n = 15) or permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Rats sustaining MI were randomized for intramyocardial injections of either saline (100 μL, n = 15) or ESA (6 μg/kg, n = 15), delivered at four standardized borderzone sites. After 4 weeks, echocardiography was performed, and the hearts were explanted. Tensile testing of the anterolateral LV wall was performed using a displacement-controlled biaxial load frame, and modulus was determined after constitutive modeling. At 4 weeks post-MI, compared to saline controls, ESA-treated hearts had greater wall thickness (1.68 ± 0.05 mm vs 1.42 ± 0.08 mm, p = 0.008), smaller end-diastolic LV internal dimension (6.88 ± 0.29 mm vs 7.69 ± 0.22 mm, p = 0.044), and improved ejection fraction (62.8 ± 3.0% vs 49.4 ± 4.5%, p = 0.014). Histologic analysis revealed significantly reduced infarct size for ESA-treated hearts compared to saline controls (29.4 ± 2.9% vs 41.6 ± 3.1%, p = 0.021). Infarcted hearts treated with ESA exhibited decreased modulus compared to those treated with saline in both the circumferential (211.5 ± 6.9 kPa vs 264.3 ± 12.5 kPa, p = 0.001) and longitudinal axes (194.5 ± 6.5 kPa vs 258.1 ± 14.4 kPa, p < 0.001). In both principal directions, ESA-treated infarcted hearts possessed similar tissue compliance as sham non-infarcted hearts. Overall, intramyocardial ESA therapy improves post-MI ventricular remodeling and function, reduces infarct size, and preserves native LV biaxial mechanical properties.",Physicochemical and in-vitro biological analysis of bio-functionalized titanium samples in a protein-rich medium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035066,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"The long-term survivability of the implants is strongly influenced by the osseointegration aspects of the metal-bone interface. In this study, biological materials such as fibrinogen and fibrin are used to functionalize titanium surfaces to enhance the ability of implants to interact with human tissues for accelerated osseointegration. The biofunctionalized samples that were assessed by White Light Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope and Water Contact Angle for surface properties proved samples etched with HF/HNO3 to be better than HCl/H2SO4 in terms of having optimum roughness and hydrophilicity for our further experiments. To further investigate the in vitro osseointegration of the biofunctionalized samples, Osteoblasts were cultured on the surfaces to assess cell proliferation, adhesion, gene expression as well as the mineralization process. Further bacterial adhesion (Enterococcus faecalis) and electrochemical evaluation of surface coating stability were carried out. Results of the study show that the biofunctionalized surfaces provided high cell proliferation, adherence, gene expression, and mineralization compared to other control surfaces hence proving them to have efficient and enhanced osseointegration. Also, bacterial adhesion studies show that there is no augmented growth of bacteria on the biofunctionalized samples in comparison to control surfaces. Electrochemical studies proved the existence of a stable protein layer on the bio functionalized surfaces. Such a method can reduce the time for osseointegration that can decrease risks in early failures of implants due to its enhanced hydrophilicity and cytocompatibility.","The influence of temperature during water-quench rapid heat treatment on the microstructure, mechanical properties and biocompatibility of Ti6Al4V ELI alloy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035065,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"This study investigates the influence of a rapid heat treatment followed by water-quenching on the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V ELI alloy to improve its strength for use in implants. Prior to the experiment, a dilatometry test was performed to understand the progressive α-to β-phase transformation taking place during heating. The results were then used to carry out heat treatments. Microstructure was analysed using SEM, EBSD, EDX and XRD techniques. Vickers micro-hardness, tensile and high cycle rotating bending tests were used to analyse the influence of the $\alpha'$-phase fraction on the strength of the studied alloy. Results show that this process can provide a Ti6Al4V ELI alloy with a better Yield Strength (YS)/uniform deformation (εu) ratio and improved high cycle fatigue strength than those observed in the current microstructure used in medical implants. Lastly, cytotoxicity tests were performed on two types of human cells, namely MG63 osteoblast-like cells and fibroblasts. The results reveal the non-toxicity of the heat-treated Ti6Al4V ELI alloy.","Prediction of loss factor (tan δ) for polymer nanocomposites as a function of yield tress, relaxation time and the width of transition region between Newtonian and power-law behaviors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035064,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"This article develops a simple model for loss or damping factor (tan δ) in polymer blends and nanocomposites as a function of yield tress, relaxation time, power-law index and the width of transition region between Newtonian and power-law behavior. The predictions of the developed model are compared to the experimental results of loss factor for the blends and nanocomposites containing poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and carbon nanotubes (CNT). Moreover, the significances of all parameters on the loss factor are justified to confirm the developed model. The calculations of developed model properly agree with the experimental results at all frequency ranges and the model's parameters reasonably change in blends and nanocomposites. A poor yield stress, short relaxation time, low power-law index and large transition region between Newtonian and power-law behavior grow the loss factor. The rational roles of these parameters in the loss factor validate the developed model.",Bioactive injectable polymethylmethacrylate/silicate bioceramic hybrid cements for percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035063,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement has been widely used to fill and stabilize hard tissue defects in clinical surgery, especially in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). However, the dense body of pure PMMA in defects has no ability to promote bone regeneration. We herein aim to fabricate novel PMMA/silicate bioceramic hybrid cements by adding bioactive calcium silicate (CS) particles into PMMA to endow PMMA/CS hybrid cements with bioactivity and biodegradability without losing the excellent mechanical strength and injectability. Following comprehensive characterization of the physicochemical properties and in vitro bioactivity study, our results showed compared with PMMA cement, the constructed PMMA/CS hybrid cements possessed significantly lower curing temperatures and simultaneously retained the acceptable mechanical strength and injectability. Moreover, obvious bioactive ion release and hydroxyapatite formation could be detected and observed after the PMMA/CS hybrid cements were soaked in simulated body fluid, indicating their pronounced bioactivity. A further in vivo study of the PMMA/CS hybrid cements on goat vertebral body defect models reflected that the PMMA/CS hybrid cements could be biodegraded well and could significantly promote new bone formation in defects 6 months of post-injection. Our results suggest that PMMA/CS hybrid cements may be promising candidates for PVP and PKP in clinic."

B, Biology",2019 06 03,"Cumulative ultraviolet (UV) exposure is associated with squamous skin cell carcinoma. UV radiation induces oxidative modifications in biomolecules of the skin leading to photocarcinogenesis. Indeed, the cyclobutene pyrimidine dimers and other dimers formed by photoaddition between carbon-carbon bonds also have an important role in the initiation process. However, information on the systemic redox status during these processes is scarce. Thus, we investigated the systemic redox profile in UVB-induced squamous cell carcinoma in mice. Female hairless mice were exposed to UVB radiation (cumulative dose = 17.1 J/cm2). The dorsal skin of these mice developed actinic keratosis (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and presented increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 3-nitrotyrosine), and decreased antioxidant defenses. Systemically, we observed the consumption of plasmatic antioxidant defenses and increased levels of advanced oxidized protein products (AOPP), an oxidative stress product derived from systemic inflammatory response. Taken together, our results indicate that UVB chronic irradiation leads not only to adjacent and tumoral oxidative stress in the skin, but it systemically is reflected through the blood. These new findings clarify some aspects of the pathogenesis of SCC and should assist in formulating better chemoprevention strategies, while avoiding additional primary SCC development and metastasis.","Joint effects of gamma radiation and cadmium on subcellular-, individual- and population-level endpoints of the green microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035029,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 10,"Interpreting and predicting the combined effects of toxicants in the environment is an important challenge in ecotoxicology. How such effects are connected across different levels of biological organisation is an additional matter of uncertainty. Such knowledge gaps are particularly prominent with regards to how ionising radiation interacts with contaminants. We assessed the response of twelve endpoints at the subcellular, individual and population level in a green microalga when exposed singly and jointly to gamma radiation and cadmium (Cd). We used a fully factorial experimental design where observed effects were compared to those predicted by the Independent Action (IA) model for mixture toxicity to determine whether they deviated from additivity. Subcellular endpoints (e.g., catalase, thiamine diphosphate, xanthophyll cycle pigments) showed an increased antioxidant and/or photoprotective response. However, our results indicate that this protection was not sufficient to prevent lipid peroxidation, which also increased with dose. At ecologically relevant doses, most interactions between gamma radiation and Cd regarding subcellular-, individual- and population-level endpoints were additive as predicted by the IA model. However, exposure to binary mixtures displayed antagonistic interactions between gamma radiation and Cd at the higher end of the tested dose spectrum. No correlations were observed between subcellular endpoints and higher-level endpoints, but there were linkages between individual and population endpoints. Our results suggest that antagonistic interactions between gamma radiation and Cd can occur at higher doses and that these interactions seem to disseminate from subcellular and individual to population level. Possible consequences for aquatic primary production and food-web interactions are discussed.",All-electrodeposited amorphous MoSx@ZnO core-shell nanorod arrays for self-powered visible-light-activated photoelectrochemical tobramycin aptasensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035027,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 05 24,"The design and construction of high-performance photoelectrode with efficient visible-light absorption and fast charge transport rate are crucial to developing photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Herein, a well-aligned amorphous MoSx (a-MoSx)@ZnO core-shell nanorod arrays was uniformly grown on indium tin oxide (ITO) via a facile all-electrochemical strategy. Simultaneous boosted PEC performance and stability in the visible region were obtained. Those could be attributed to the collaboration effect of fast electron transfer path within the oriented ZnO nanorod and extended visible-light absorption upon combining a-MoSx, as well as favorable energy-band alignment between the two PEC materials. By employing tobramycin-binding aptamer as recognition element, a self-powered PEC aptasensor for tobramycin was successfully fabricated for the first time. The sensor exhibited a rapid response in a wide linear range of 0.010-50 ng/mL with good stability and reproducibility. The detection limit was as low as 5.7 pg/mL. Ultrasensitive and high-affinitive determination of tobramycin in serum samples was realized at 0 V (vs.SCE) with desired accuracy and satisfactory recovery. This work reveals the promising application of all-electrodeposited a-MoSx@ZnO NR arrays-based photoanode for self-powered PEC bioassay in the tobramycin-related disease diagnosis.",Real time monitoring of glucose in whole blood by smartphone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035026,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 05 24,"A combined thread-paper microfluidic device (μTPAD) is presented for the determination of glucose in blood.

The automatic detection of the region of interest on the thread allows for the use of either initial rate or equilibrium signal as analytical parameters. The time needed for analysis is 12 s using initial rate, and 100 s using the equilibrium measurement with a LOD of 48 μM and 12 μM, respectively, and a precision around 7%. The μTPAD allows a rapid determination of glucose in real samples using only 3 μL of whole blood.","Interest of studying the saliva metabolome, transcriptome and microbiome in screening for pancreatic cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035025,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2019 06 03,"Pancreatic cancer is a public health problem because its mortality rate is close to its incidence rate.

The flap responds physiologically to hypoxia, hypocellularity, and hypovascularity, which are characteristic results of osteoradionecrotic injury. Here, we propose a reproducible, simple, and safe method for harvesting a forearm free flap, allowing us to obtain a periosteal composite free flap. Our technique offers potential early management of osteoradionecrotic lesions resistant to medical treatment. Furthermore, the forearm periosteal composite free flap offers the advantage of a long vascular pedicle which is ideally suited for necks which have been submitted to irradiation or multiple operations. Thusly, vascular anastomosis can be performed at a distance from the irradiated areas. Compared to other periosteal free flaps, such as those harvested from the iliac crest or the internal femoral condyle, the presence of a skin paddle facilitates clinical flap monitoring, optimizes the restoration of bone sealing, and facilitates the treatment of scarring.",Infantile and adult mortality in precarious conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035021,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2019 05 15,"Maxillofacial surgery plays an important role in humanitarian surgery because this specialty includes common procedures such as facial reconstruction after burns, facial clefts or Noma's sequelae, which do not require complex infrastructures and thus can be carried out in sub-optimal conditions.

Despite its worldwide prevalence, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of NASH. The progression of NASH is mainly accelerated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipotoxicity. The transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is pivotal for the elimination of ROS. Accordingly, activators of Nrf2 have been implicated as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of NASH. Niclosamide (ethanolamine salt; NEN), a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), is currently used as an anthelmintic drug for the treatment of parasitic infections. Recently, NEN was shown to improve hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. However, the underlying mechanism of its antioxidant function in NASH remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NEN induces AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of p62 at S351 that can lead to noncanonical Nrf2 activation. We also demonstrate that NEN protects cells and mouse liver from acute lipotoxic stress through activating p62-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Taken together, NEN can be used for clinical applications and has the potential to provide a new therapeutic option for NASH.",Computational solutions in redox lipidomics - Current strategies and future perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035005,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 06 16,"The high chemical diversity of lipids allows them to perform multiple biological functions ranging from serving as structural building blocks of biological membranes to regulation of metabolism and signal transduction. In addition to the native lipidome, lipid species derived from enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications (the epilipidome) make the overall picture even more complex, as their functions are still largely unknown. Oxidized lipids represent the fraction of epilipidome which has attracted high scientific attention due to their apparent involvement in the onset and development of numerous human disorders. Development of high-throughput analytical methods such as liquid chromatography coupled on-line to mass spectrometry provides the possibility to address epilipidome diversity in complex biological samples. However, the main bottleneck of redox lipidomics, the branch of lipidomics dealing with the characterization of oxidized lipids, remains the lack of optimal computational tools for robust, accurate and specific identification of already discovered and yet unknown modified lipids. Here we discuss the main principles of high-throughput identification of lipids and their modified forms and review the main software tools currently available in redox lipidomics. Different levels of confidence for software assisted identification of redox lipidome are defined and necessary steps toward optimal computational solutions are proposed.",The S1P mimetic fingolimod phosphate regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress in neuronal cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035004,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 05 19,"Fingolimod is one of the few oral drugs available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism of action proposed for this drug is based in the phosphorylation of the molecule to produce its active metabolite fingolimod phosphate (FP) which, in turns, through its interaction with S1P receptors, triggers the functional sequestration of T lymphocytes in lymphoid nodes. On the other hand, part if not most of the damage produced in MS and other neurological disorders seem to be mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondria is one of the main sources of ROS. In the present work, we have evaluated the anti-oxidant profile of FP in a model of mitochondrial oxidative damage induced by menadione (Vitk3) on neuronal cultures. We provide evidence that incubation of neuronal cells with FP alleviates the Vitk3-induced toxicity, due to a decrease in mitochondrial ROS production. It also decreases regulated cell death triggered by imbalance in oxidative stress (restore values of advanced oxidation protein products and total thiol levels). Also restores mitochondrial function (cytochrome c oxidase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rate) and morphology. Furthermore, increases the expression and activity of protective factors (increases Nrf2, HO1 and Trx2 expression and GST and NQO1 activity), being some of these effects modulated by its interaction with the S1P receptor. FP seems to increase mitochondrial stability and restore mitochondrial dynamics under conditions of oxidative stress, making this drug a potential candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases other than MS.",EPR detection of sulfanyl radical during sulfhemoglobin formation - Influence of catalase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035002,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 05 19,"Hemoglobin in its ferryl form oxidizes hydrogen sulfide and is transformed to sulfhemoglobin, where the sulfur is inserted covalently at the heme edge. Shown here is evidence that-as previously proposed by others-this process involves oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to a sulfanyl radical detectable by spin-trapping in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The yields and rates of formation of sulfhemoglobin as well as of the sulfanyl radical are affected by the same factors that affect the reactivity of hemoglobin ferryl, in bovine hemoglobin and in phytoglobins as well. A freely-diffusing sulfanyl radical is thus proposed to be involved in sulfhemoglobin formation. Catalase is shown to accelerate this process due to a previously described hydrogen sulfide oxidase activity, within which EPR evidence for sulfanyl generation is shown here for the first time.

FtsZ is a GTP hydrolyzing protein, conserved in prokaryotes that plays a central role in Z-ring formation during cell division cytokinesis stage. This study employs the use of pharmacophore models derived from two different datasets based on Mtb-FtsZ GTPase inhibition and whole cell antibacterial activity, to virtually screen and shortlist novel compounds from In-house small molecule library as Mtb-FtsZ inhibitors and evaluate their in-vitro and ex-vivo activity.

The insufficient and heterogeneous hypoxic condition in tumor tissues hurdles the therapeutic potency of bioreductive chemodrugs. We herein report a NIR light-triggered CO release system based on mesoporous Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) to enable cancer-selective hypoxia aggravation and hypoxia-responsive activation of bioreductive anti-cancer drug, tirapazamine (TPZ). Pentacarbonyl iron (Fe(CO)5) was coupled to PB NPs via coordination interaction, and TPZ was encapsulated into the pores of PB NPs. To prolong blood circulation and improve tumor accumulation, the PB-CO-TPZ NPs were surface-decorated with PEG-NH2. Upon tumor site-specific light irradiation, the non-lethal photothermal effect of PB NPs released CO, which accelerated mitochondrial oxygen consumption and generated hypoxia to activate TPZ. The CO-induced mitochondrial exhaustion simultaneously led to cancer cell apoptosis, thus realizing synergistic anti-cancer effect with TPZ-mediated bioreductive chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to activate bioreductive chemotherapy using CO. This study thus provides a promising paradigm to realize effective and safe cancer treatment via precise manipulation of drug activities, and may open new insights in the use of CO for biomedical treatment.","Cumulative directional calcium gluing between phosphate and silicate: A facile, robust and biocompatible strategy for siRNA delivery by amine-free non-positive vector.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034981,Biomaterials,2019 05 15,"For siRNA therapeutics, the use of positively charged amine-rich delivery vectors has been indispensable, but the amine-associated toxicological responses remain a clinical conundrum. Herein, we report a new strategy of harnessing a biocompatible, biodegradable and well-tolerated nanomaterial as an amine-free non-positive carrier for siRNA delivery. By employing mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as a biocompatible vector, siRNA is loaded nonconventionally through calcium ion (Ca2+)-mediated interconnection (calcium gluing) between phosphates of siRNA and surface silicates of MSNs in a sequential, cumulative and directional way. The ""one-pot"" gluing process utilizing endogenously abundant Ca2+ ions offers a simple but robust means of siRNA loading on the non-positive bare surface of MSNs without the aid of multi-amine functionalization, and thus minimizes the risk of amine-associated cytotoxicity and immunogenicity while keeping the intrinsic biocompatibility of MSNs. As demonstrated with loading of an anticancer siRNA, this strategy allows stable in vivo delivery of siRNA for targeted gene silencing, and capitalizes on the unique structural versatility of MSNs by simultaneously delivering a pore-loaded chemodrug to synergistically enhance the treatment efficacy. Therefore, the Ca2+-glued MSNs as a general siRNA carrier platform provide a less toxic, less laborious and more utilitarian delivery tool for more effective and safer siRNA therapeutics.",Fluorescence imaging guided CpG nanoparticles-loaded IR820-hydrogel for synergistic photothermal immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034980,Biomaterials,2019 05 15,"As synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has developed as one of the most attractive strategies for cancer therapy, it is crucial to design an effective photothermal immunotherapy system to enhance the synergistic anti-tumor effect and reveal the essential role of each treatment.

IR820-hydrogel can be effective for hyperthermia to eliminate the primary tumor based on its comprehensive coverage and generated photothermal-induced tumor antigens for assisted immunotherapy. CpG self-crosslinked nanoparticles improved the immune response of adjuvant against melanoma without extra nano-carriers. The synergistic photothermal immunotherapy was achieved by the merging of CpG self-crosslinked nanoparticles and IR820-hydrogel. A possible mechanism of combined antitumor effect was further revealed by analyzing immune cells including CD8 +T cells, DCs, B cells, Treg and MDSC in tumor microenvironment. The specific antitumor immunity was provoked to remove the tumor residues and ultimately the combined treatment mode achieved more effective systemic therapeutic effect than either photothermal therapy or immunotherapy alone.

One limitation concerns the hemifields in which objects move. A previous study showed that when subjects were restricted to the use of one hemifield, both the maximum number of tracked objects and the tracking accuracy were lower than when they were permitted to use both hemifields. However, daily life involves many tracked objects moving between hemifields. In this study, we investigated the effects of such hemifield crossings on behavioral performance (Behavioral experiment) and on the amplitudes and phase synchronization of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) (SSVEP experiment) by comparing the Within condition, in which tracked objects moved within their respective hemifields, and the Crossover condition, in which tracked objects moved between hemifields. In the Behavioral experiment, tracking performance was worse under the Crossover condition than under the Within condition. In the SSVEP experiment, SSVEP amplitudes for target and distractor frequencies differed under the Within condition but did not differ under the Crossover condition. However, phase synchronization between the left and right hemifields exhibited the opposite trend. This study provides evidence that attention to objects moving between hemifields is suppressed relative to attention to objects moving within hemifields and that Crossover tracking diminishes attentional modulation at an early sensory processing level while modulating interhemispheric functional connectivity.",Association Between Axonopathy and Amyloid Plaques in the Spinal Cord of the Transgenic Mice of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034974,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Axonopathy manifested by axon swellings might constitute one of the earliest pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. It has been proposed that axonopathy might be associated with the origin of Aβ plaques. However, how axonopathy leads to Aβ plaque pathogenesis remains elusive. Our previous studies have shown that Aβ neuropathology (mainly diffuse plaques) selectively occurred in the regions of corticospinal tract (CST) pathway and its innervated region in the spinal cord of TgCRND8 mice. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and progression of axonopathy and the possible implication in Aβ plaque pathogenesis in the spinal cord of TgCRND8 mice. By anterograde labeling of CST system with a neuroanatomical tracer, we found that dilated corticospinal axons started to appear at 7 months, then exhibited an age-dependent increase. These abnormal structures appear before any plaque deposits are visible in the spinal cord of the mice. Importantly, they colocalized with Aβ plaques in either the white matter or gray matter of the spinal cord at later stages, suggesting that these axonal swellings might represent the initial stages of Aβ plaque formation, and could play a role in Aβ plaque pathogenesis. Furthermore, using ultrastructural analysis we demonstrated that intracellular contents in the axonal dystrophies such as various dense vesicles leaked out into the extracellular matrix under a condition of axon swelling rupture in CST pathways of spinal cord. This provided precise structural evidence that how the Aβ leaks out from the axonal dystrophies into extracellular matrix and how an axonal swelling might serve as a nidus of amyloid plaque formation.",The Water Diffusion of Brain Following Hypoglycemia in Rats - A Study with Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Neuropathologic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034973,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"We established hypoglycemic rat models and divided them into three groups (the sham group, the acute hypoglycemia group and the recovery group). The brain water diffusion was examined using DWI. Thereafter, neuropathologic examinations were performed in order to evaluate the distribution of brain damage. The expression of AQP4 and Caspase3 was also examined using Western blot. We aimed to determine the specific brain regions which were vulnerable to hypoglycemia in relation to the water diffusion and neuropathology. The DWI scanning showed abnormal water diffusion in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus during each stage of hypoglycemia. In the acute hypoglycemia group, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the hypothalamus was increased, while the ADC of the somatosensory cortex (SSc), subcortex and striatum (Str) was decreased. After glucose reperfusion and a 7-day recovery period, most of the hypoglycemia-induced changes in ADC returned to normal, except in the hypothalamus, posterior SSc and DG, which demonstrated increased ADC levels. The lowest AQP4 expression was observed in the cortex of the acute hypoglycemia group. Furthermore, there was increased Caspase3 expression in the hippocampus of the recovery group. The expression of Caspase3 in the hypothalamus was most prominent in the acute hypoglycemia group. Our work revealed that hypoglycemia significantly influenced the water diffusion of the brain. The decrease of AQP4 was associated with the formation of cytotoxic edema in acute hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia primarily tends to damage the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus and may result in permanent injury to the brain.",PET Neuroimaging Reveals Serotonergic and Metabolic Dysfunctions in the Hippocampal Electrical Kindling Model of Epileptogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034972,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Glucose metabolism and serotonergic neurotransmission have been reported to play an important role in epileptogenesis. We therefore aimed to use neuroimaging to evaluate potential alterations in serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and glucose metabolism during epileptogenesis in the rat electrical kindling model. To achieve this goal, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a rat epileptogenesis model triggered by electrical stimulation of the hippocampus using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), a radiolabeled analog of glucose, and 2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine (18F-MPPF), a radiolabeled 5-HT1A receptor ligand, to evaluate brain metabolism and 5-HT1A receptor functionality. Since the 5-HT1A receptor is also highly expressed in astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence was performed to detect astrogliosis arising from the kindling procedure once the study was finalized. Lastly, in vitro18F-MPPF autoradiography was performed to evaluate changes in 5HT1A receptor expression. 18F-FDG PET showed reduction of glucose uptake in cortical structures, whereas 18F-MPPF PET revealed an enhancement of tracer binding potential (BPND) in key areas rich in 5-HT1A receptor involved in epilepsy, including septum, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of kindled animals compared to controls. However, in vitro 5-HT1A receptor autoradiography showed no changes in densitometric signal in any brain region, suggesting that the augmentation in BPND found by PET could be caused by reduction of synaptic serotonin. Importantly, astroglial activation was detected in the hippocampus of kindled rats. Overall, electrical kindling induced hypometabolism, astrogliosis and serotonergic alterations in epilepsy-related regions. Furthermore, the present findings point to 5-HT1A receptor as a valuable epileptogenesis biomarker candidate and a potential therapeutic target.",Pupils say more than a thousand words: Pupil size reflects how observed actions are interpreted.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034971,Cognition,2019 06 14,"Humans attend to others' facial expressions and body language to better understand their emotions and predict goals and intentions. The eyes and its pupils reveal important social information. Because pupil size is beyond voluntary control yet reflective of a range of cognitive and affective processes, pupils in principal have the potential to convey whether others' actions are interpreted correctly or not. Here, we measured pupil size while participants observed video-clips showing reach-to-grasp arm movements. Expressors in the video-clips were playing a board game and moved a dowel to a new position. Participants' task was to decide whether the dowel was repositioned with the intention to be followed up by another move of the same expressor (personal intention) or whether the arm movement carried the implicit message that expressor's turn was over (social intention). Replicating earlier findings, results showed that participants recognized expressors' intentions on the basis of their arm kinematics. Results further showed that participants' pupil size was larger when observing actions reflecting personal compared to social intentions. Most interestingly, before participants indicated how they interpreted the observed actions by choosing to press one of two keys (corresponding to the personal or social intention), their pupils within a split second, had already given away how they interpreted the expressor's movement. In sum, this study underscores the importance of nonverbal behavior in helping social messages get across quickly. Revealing how actions are interpreted, pupils may provide additional feedback for effective social interactions."

Seven healthy subjects received three (every 12 h) 1-h i.v. infusions of 4, 2 and 2 million international units (MIU) of CMS co-administered with 200, 100 and 100 mg of AZT, respectively. In an ex vivo study, urinary bactericidal titres (UBTs) and time-kill curve determinations were performed in artificial urine spiked with colistin sulfate and AZT according to median and minimum peak concentrations in urine measured after the first and third dose using four mcr-1-positive colistin-resistant and five colistin-susceptible Gram-negative isolates. Reciprocal UBTs for the different colistin concentrations obtained in urine ranged from 1-128 and 0-2 for colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant isolates, respectively. Combination with AZT could increase UBTs up to two dilution steps each for the Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter strains tested. In contrast, the combination had no activity against Pseudomonas strains. In time-kill curves, the combination showed bactericidal activity against colistin-resistant strains even when the substances alone were not bactericidal. Thus, combination of CMS with AZT shows promising synergistic activity against Gram-negative uropathogens, including colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. According to the urinary bactericidal activity, a maintenance dosage of 2 MIU of CMS combined with 100 mg of AZT twice daily may be sufficient for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by colistin-susceptible strains. However, the dosage requires optimisation for efficient treatment of UTIs caused by colistin-resistant strains.","In vitro susceptibility of urinary Escherichia coli isolates to first- and second-line empirically prescribed oral antimicrobials: CANWARD surveillance study results for Canadian outpatients, 2007-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034938,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 06 15,"Escherichia coli isolates (n = 2035) from urine specimens of outpatients presenting to Canadian medical clinics and hospital emergency departments from 2007-2016 were collected as part of the CANWARD surveillance study. Isolate identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) were performed at a central site (Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, Canada). AST of first- and second-line oral antimicrobial agents was performed using CLSI methods (M07, 11th ed, 2018); fosfomycin was tested by agar dilution and all other agents by broth microdilution. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were interpreted using CLSI M100 (2018) criteria. Fosfomycin (99.2% of isolates susceptible), nitrofurantoin (97.5%) and cefalexin (93.6%) were the most active agents tested; amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) (85.6%), ciprofloxacin (83.0%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (77.0%) were less active. Annual percentages of isolates positive for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) or demonstrating multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes increased from 0.8% (2007) to 10.1% (2016), and from 9.7% (2007) to 16.5% (2016), respectively, whilst the annual frequency of AmpC-positive isolates decreased from a high of 3.2% in 2008 to 0.7% in 2016. The most common MDR phenotype of E. coli was non-susceptibility to AMC, ciprofloxacin, and SXT, accounting for 12.7% (26/205) of all MDR isolates. Rates of susceptibility were higher for fosfomycin than for the five other oral agents tested against ESBL-positive (96.1% susceptible) and MDR (95.1%) isolates and were equal to nitrofurantoin (96.4%) against AmpC-positive isolates.

However, data concerning mcr in fresh vegetables, a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes, are still rare. In this study, mcr genes were analysed in 528 vegetable samples from 53 supermarkets or farmer's markets in 23 cities of 9 provinces in China, and the mcr-positive Enterobacteriaceae were characterized. Nineteen (3.6%) samples carried one or more mcr-positive isolates, and the highest three detection rates were found in carrot, pak choi and green pepper. Twenty-four mcr-1-positive isolates (23 Escherichia coli and one Enterobacter cloacae) were obtained, and E. coli isolates showed high genetic diversity. Different multilocus sequence type (MLST) isolates were also observed within the same sample. All 24 isolates showed multidrug resistance, and 14 carried blaCTX-M genes. Most isolates harbored similarly conjugative IncX4-type (∼33 kb) or IncI2-type (∼60 kb) mcr-1-bearing plasmids. The sequenced prevalent IncX4 plasmid and IncI2 plasmid from tomato were similar to the relevant plasmids from animals and clinical isolates in various countries. mcr-1-bearing IncHI2/ST3 plasmid highly similar to that carrying 14 resistance genes from E. coli of chicken was also observed. In conclusion, a high prevalence of mcr-1 in fresh vegetables was found in China, and the dissemination of mcr-1 was mediated by similar IncX4 or IncI2 plasmids. The plasmids from vegetables showed high similarity to plasmids from clinical isolates, indicating MCR-1-producers in ready-to-eat vegetables may pose a huge threat to public health and measures need to be taken to ensure food safety.","Aflatoxin, fumonisin, ochratoxin, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol biomarkers in human biological fluids: A systematic literature review, 2001-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034935,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 06 07,"Human exposure to mycotoxins occurs mostly through dietary intake, although exposure through dermal and inhalation routes has also been shown.

Iscador P caused a decrease in the activity of all lysosomal hydrolases (except cathepsins) in the lysosomal pellet, and an increase in the activity of both aminopeptidases and β-D-glucuronidase in the cytosol. However, despite membranotropic properties of the viscotoxins, we did not find a significant labilising effect on the lysosomal membranes. Only β-D-glucuronidase activity was relocated to the supernatant of lysosomal fraction.

In the present study, IXN antimetastatic potential in vitro against the highly invasive melanoma cell line B16-F10 and in vivo in a murine metastatic model was investigated. Melanoma cell viability was diminished in a dose-dependent manner following the treatment with IXN. This decrease was a consequence of autophagy and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, the dividing potential of highly proliferative melanoma cells was dramatically affected by this isoflavanone, which was in correlation with an abrogated cell colony forming potential, indicating changes in their metastatic features. Concordantly, IXN promoted strong suppression of the processes that define metastasis- cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. Further investigation at the molecular level revealed that the abolished metastatic potential of a melanoma subclone was due to disrupted integrin signaling. Importantly, these results were reaffirmed in vivo where IXN inhibited the development of lung metastatic foci in tumor-challenged animals. The results of the present study may highlight the beneficial effects of IXN on melanoma as the most aggressive type of skin cancer and will hopefully shed a light on the possible use of this prenylflavonoid in the treatment of metastatic malignancies.",Preclinical evaluation of the maximum tolerated dose and toxicokinetics of enteric-coated lantibiotic OG253 capsules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034929,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 05 24,"Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) is the leading infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in the United States.

OG253 capsule administration neither significantly alter the weight of organs nor affect the hematology, coagulation, clinical biochemistry parameters and urine pH compared to placebo capsule administered rats. LC-MS/MS analysis did not detect OG253 in the plasma, indicating that OG253 is not absorbed into the blood from the rat gastrointestinal tract.

Currently, standard methods for cancer therapy including BC are surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often fail to treat BC due to the side effects that these therapies incur in normal tissues and organs. In recent years, various nanoparticles (NPs) have been discovered and synthesized to be able to selectively target tumor cells without causing any harm to the healthy cells or organs. Therefore, NPs-mediated targeted drug delivery systems (DDS) have become a promising technique to treat BC. In addition to their selectivity to target tumor cells and reduce side effects, NPs have other unique properties which make them desirable for cancer treatment such as low toxicity, good compatibility, ease of preparation, high photoluminescence (PL) for bioimaging in vivo, and high loadability of drugs due to their tunable surface functionalities. In this study, we summarize with a critical analysis of the most recent therapeutic studies involving various NPs-mediated DDS as alternatives for the traditional treatment approaches for BC. It will shed light on the significance of NPs-mediated DDS and serve as a guide to seeking for the ideal methodology for future targeted drug delivery for an efficient BC treatment."

The DE group had further separated to 3 sub-groups to investigate the effects achieved by different time for drug administration (60 min before stroke (DE-60 m), 15 min (DE+15 m) and 60 min (DE+60 m) after stroke). Although all infarct groups improved over time, the combination of bis(propyl)-cognitin and treadmill exercise effectively enhanced motor recovery during 14-day intervention. Early drug intervention has a best recovery result, the DE+15 m group with drug intervention at 15-min after stroke had better motor recovery than DE+60 m, DO, EO and control groups. Both bis(propyl)-cognitin and treadmill exercise significantly elevated brain VEGF expression and decreased brain infarct volume at 14 day post-ischemia.

Therefore, the possibility of a circadian rhythm in CSF and plasma, and the presence of a rostrocaudal concentration gradient (RCG) in CSF for aforementioned monoamines/metabolites, were investigated. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (RP-UHPLC-ECD) to measure monoamine/metabolite concentrations in 271 paired CSF and plasma samples, successively collected over a period of 30 h and derived from eight healthy subjects. Plasma samples were also analyzed for melatonin, serving as positive control analyte, using ELISA. The RCG examination entailed RP-UHPLC-ECD analyses on five consecutive CSF samples derived from 10 patients with AD and 10 non-AD/control subjects. Besides a diurnal rhythm for melatonin, we found a similar rhythmicity for plasma HVA, with acrophases occurring between 02:00 and 06:00 h, in four out of seven subjects. Three and two subjects showed a circadian rhythm for CSF HVA and 5-HIAA, respectively. No rhythmicity was observed in any other compound. We found that only CSF MHPG, HVA and 5-HIAA levels differed across CSF fractions, and that these changes in 5-HIAA levels varied in the AD versus non-AD/control group. Positive correlations between CSF volume and HVA and 5-HIAA levels, indicative of a RCG, were also observed. Such a RCG could not be detected for the other monoamines/metabolites. Our results stress the importance of standardizing sampling procedures of biological fluids with respect to time of day, volume and number of samples.",Reduced postnatal expression of cochlear Connexin26 induces hearing loss and affects the developmental status of pillar cells in a dose-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034913,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 17,"Mutations in the GJB2 gene (which encodes Connexin26 (Cx26)) are the most common cause of non-syndromic deafness. Previous studies showed that an extensive knockout of the Gjb2 gene in cochlear epithelium can cause severe deafness, significant hair cell (HC) loss and failure of pillar cells (a type of supporting cell, PCs) to differentiate in mice. This study aimed to establish different mouse models with gradient reductions of cochlear Cx26 expression and to investigate the effect of different reduced levels of cochlear Cx26 expression on hearing and development of PCs. According to the reduction in the levels of cochlear Cx26, these models were named high knockdown (KD), middle KD and low KD group. In the low KD group, the mice showed normal hearing and well-developed PCs. In the high KD group, up to 90 percent of supporting cells (SCs) lost Cx26 expression. These mice exhibited severe deafness, rapid hair cell degeneration and juvenile PCs. In the middle KD group, nearly half of SCs lost Cx26 expression. However, these mice showed a moderate deafness and a late-onset hair cell loss. Moreover, nearly all the PCs in mice of this group were in a partially differentiated state. These results indicated that reduction of postnatal expression of cochlear Cx26 induces hearing loss in a dose-dependent manner. Null Cx26 in a few SCs affects the developmental status of PCs and the hair cell degeneration pattern. The abnormal developmental status of PCs may be a potential cause of Gjb2-related hearing loss.","In vitro impact of amino acid-derived bacterial metabolites on colonocyte mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress response and DNA integrity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034912,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

General subjects,2019 06 02,"A reversible post-translational protein modification which involves addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) onto hydroxyl groups of serine and/or threonine residues which is known as O-GlcNAcylation, has emerged as a potent competitor of phosphorylation. This glycosyltransfer reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT). This enzyme uses uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the end product of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, to modify numerous nuclear and cytosolic proteins. O-GlcNAcylation influences cancer cell metabolism in such a way that hyper-O-GlcNAcylation is considered as a prominent trait of many cancers, and is proposed as a major factor enabling cancer cell proliferation and progression. Growing evidence supports a connection between O-GlcNAcylation and major oncogenic factors, including for example, c-MYC, HIF-1α, and NF-κB. A comprehensive study of the roles of O-GlcNAc modification of oncogenic factors is warranted as a thorough understanding may help drive advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The focus of this article is to highlight the interplay between oncogenic factors and O-GlcNAcylation along with OGT in cancer cell proliferation and survival. The prospects for OGT inhibitors will also be discussed.",No Inhibition of MATE1/2K-Mediated Renal Creatinine Secretion Predicted With Ritonavir or Cobicistat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034908,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 05 27,"Cobicistat has been reported to increase serum creatinine clinically without affecting glomerular filtration. This was ascribed to transient inhibition of MATE1-mediated renal creatinine secretion. Interestingly, a structurally similar drug, ritonavir, has not been associated with serum creatinine increases at the pharmacoenhancer dose. The present study was aimed to investigate the translation of in vitro MATE1/2K inhibition to clinical creatinine increase (cobicistat) and lack of it (ritonavir) considering their intracellular concentrations in renal proximal tubules. Uptake studies showed ritonavir and cobicistat are unlikely substrates for OCT2. The steady-state unbound concentration in the cytosol of human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells was comparable with the extracellular unbound concentration, suggesting that the entry of these compounds is predominantly mediated by passive diffusion. Ritonavir and cobicistat are MATE1 and MATE2K inhibitors with IC50 values of 3.1 and 90 μM (ritonavir), and 4.4 and 3.2 μM (cobicistat), respectively. However, the unbound cytosolic concentrations (Cu,cytosol) of ritonavir and cobicistat in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, 0.065 and 0.10 μM, respectively, after incubation with the clinical maximum total plasma concentrations at pharmacoenhancer doses does not support inhibition in vivo; Cu,cytosol >30 fold lower than IC50s. These results demonstrate that MATE1/2K inhibition is unlikely the mechanism of the clinical creatinine elevations with cobicistat.",Quantifying the Value of Orally Delivered Biologic Therapies: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Oral Semaglutide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034907,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 10,"Oral semaglutide, which has undergone multiple phase 3 clinical trials, represents the first oral biologic medication for type 2 diabetes in the form of a daily capsule. It provides similar efficacy compared with its weekly injection counterpart, but it demands a dose on the order of 100 times as high and requires more frequent administration. We perform a cost effectiveness analysis using a first and second order Monte Carlo simulation to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancies associated with an oral daily capsule, oral weekly capsule, daily injection, and weekly injection of semaglutide. We conclude that the additional costs incurred to produce extra semaglutide for the oral formulation are cost effective, given the greater quality of life experienced when taking a capsule over a weekly injection. We also demonstrate that the potency of semaglutide allows the formulation to be cost effective, and less potent drugs will require increased oral bioavailability to make a cost effective oral formulation.","pH-responsive chitosan based hydrogels affect the release of dapsone: Design, set-up, and physicochemical characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034906,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"Dapsone (DAP) is a bactericidal agent used in the treatment of leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Despite its therapeutic potential, DAP has low solubility, which results in allow therapeutic index and a high microbial resistance. Recently, new approaches were used to increase the DAP solubility. In particular, the use of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN)-hydrogels based chitosan (CS) for the controlled release of DAP provides some advantages because they can modify their swelling properties and network structures as a response to environmental stimuli. The aim of this study was to synthesize and physicochemically characterize pH-responsive chitosan/polymer hydrogels to control the release of DAP. For this reason, different combination of polymers, such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and concentrations of the cross-linking agents (glutaraldehyde) were used and then blended to the CS. The resulting hydrogels were evaluated in terms of physicochemical and swelling properties, rheological analysis and in vitro release of DAP at different pHs (1.2-6.8). Hydrogels were further characterized by Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. pH-responsive DAP-loaded hydrogels may represent the set-up for developing potential oral formulations for the treatment of leprosy caused by Mycobacterium leprae.","ClCPI, a cysteine protease inhibitor purified from Cassia leiandra seeds has antifungal activity against Candida tropicalis by inducing disruption of the cell surface.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034905,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"Infections caused by Candida tropicalis have increased significantly worldwide in parallel with resistance to antifungal drugs. To overcome resistance novel drugs have to be discovered. The objective of this work was to purify and characterize a cysteine protease inhibitor from the seeds of the Amazon rainforest tree Cassia leiandra and test its inhibitory effect against C. tropicalis growth. The inhibitor, named ClCPI, was purified after ion exchange and affinity chromatography followed by ultrafiltration. ClCPI is composed of a single polypeptide chain and is not a glycoprotein. The molecular mass determined by SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of β-mercaptoethanol and ESI-MS were 16.63 kDa and 18.362 kDa, respectively. ClCPI was stable in the pH range of 7.0-9.0 and thermostable up to 60 °C for 20 min. ClCPI inhibited cysteine proteases, but not trypsin, chymotrypsin neither alpha-amylase. Inhibition of papain was uncompetitive with a Ki of 4.1 × 10-7 M and IC50 of 8.5 × 10-7 M. ClCPI at 2.6 × 10-6 M reduced 50% C. tropicalis growth. ClCPI induced damages and morphological alterations in C. tropicalis cell surface, which led to death. These results suggest that ClCPI have great potential for the development of an antifungal drug against C. tropicalis.",Salt bridges are pivotal for the kinetic stability of GH26 endo-mannanase (ManB-1601).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034904,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"Hitherto, how salt bridges contribute towards the structure-function of endo-mannanases has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we revealed that ManB-1601 (GH26 endo-mannanase from Bacillus sp.) has eight salt bridges which are highly conserved among GH26 endo-mannanases from Bacillus spp. Disruption of salt bridges do not alter overall structure, optimum pH and temperature of ManB-1601. Among the salt bridges, elimination of K95/E156 and E171/R221 pair decreased the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of ManB-1601. Differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal equilibrium denaturation studies suggested that salt bridges do not markedly contribute towards thermal (∆Tm 0 to -5 °C) and conformational stability (∆∆G -0.37 to -1.25 Kcal mol-1) of ManB-1601. Interestingly, salt bridges were found to prominently contribute towards kinetic stability of ManB-1601 as salt bridge mutants exhibited drastic reduction in half-life of enzyme inactivation (T1/2) at 66 °C (1.1 to 6-fold) and 70 °C (4.09 to 22.5-fold). Molecular dynamic simulations studies showed that salt bridges contribute towards maintaining the biological activity against thermal denaturation by rigidifying the active site. Our study on ManB-1601 suggest that even in the case salt bridges do not confer thermal and conformational stabilities they may serve as crucial structural elements for enzyme functioning by contributing towards kinetic stability."

This review focuses on functional interaction between DNA polymerases and DNA ligases in the repair of single- and double-strand DNA breaks, and discusses the notion that the substrate channeling during DNA polymerase-mediated nucleotide insertion coupled to DNA ligation could be a mechanism to minimize the release of potentially mutagenic repair intermediates. Evidence suggesting that DNA ligases are essential for cell viability includes the fact that defects or insufficiency in DNA ligase are casually linked to genome instability. In the future, it may be possible to develop small molecule inhibitors of mammalian DNA ligases and/or their functional protein partners that potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic compounds and improve cancer treatment outcomes.",Increased Aggregation Tendency of Alpha-Synuclein in a Fully Disordered Protein Complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034892,Journal of molecular biology,2019 05 22,"The recent discovery of biologically active fully disordered, so called random fuzzy protein-protein interactions leads to the question of how the high flexibility of these protein complexes correlates to aggregation and pathologic misfolding. We identify the structural mechanism by which a random fuzzy protein complex composed of the intrinsically disordered proteins alpha-Synuclein and SERF1a is able to potentiate cytotoxic aggregation. A structural model derived from an integrated NMR/SAXS analysis of the reconstituted aSyn:SERF1a complex enabled us to observe the partial deprotection of one precise aSyn amyloid nucleation element in the fully unstructured ensemble. This minimal exposure was sufficient to increase the amyloidogenic tendency of SERF1a-bound aSyn. Our findings provide a structural explanation of the previously observed pro-amyloid activity of SERF1a. They further demonstrate that random fuzziness can trigger a structurally organized disease-associated reaction such as amyloid polymerization.",An Interspecies Analysis Reveals Molecular Construction Principles of Interleukin 27.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034891,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 06,"Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a cytokine that regulates inflammatory responses. It is composed of an α subunit (IL-27α) and a β subunit (EBI3), which together form heterodimeric IL-27. Despite this general principle, IL-27 from different species shows distinct characteristics: Human IL-27α is not secreted autonomously while EBI3 is. In mice, the subunits show a reciprocal behavior. The molecular basis and the evolutionary conservation of these differences have remained unclear. They are biologically important, however, since secreted IL-27 subunits can act as cytokines on their own. Here, we show that formation of a single disulfide bond is an evolutionary conserved trait, which determines secretion-competency of IL-27α. Furthermore, combining cell-biological with computational approaches, we provide detailed structural insights into IL-27 heterodimerization and find that it relies on a conserved interface. Lastly, our study reveals a hitherto unknown construction principle of IL-27: one secretion-competent subunit generally pairs with one that depends on the other to induce its secretion. Taken together, these findings significantly extend our understanding of IL-27 biogenesis as a key cytokine and highlight how protein assembly can influence immunoregulation.",Nascent β Structure in the Elongated Hydrophobic Region of a Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker PrP Allele.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034890,Journal of molecular biology,2019 05 23,"Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome is an inherited prion disease with one early-onset allele (HRdup) containing an eight-amino-acid insertion; this LGGLGGYV insert is positioned after valine 129 (human PrPC sequence) in a hydrophobic tract in the natively disordered region. Here we have characterized the structure and explored the molecular motions and dynamics of HRdup PrP and a control allele. High-resolution NMR data suggest that the core of HRdup has a canonical PrPC structure, yet a nascent β-structure is observed in the flexible elongated hydrophobic region of HRdup. In addition, using mouse PrPC sequence, we observed that a methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 128 (equivalent of methionine/valine 129 in human sequence) and oligomerization caused by high protein concentration affects conformational exchange dynamics at residue G130. We hypothesize that with the β-structure at the N-terminus, the hydrophobic region of HRdup can adopt a fully extended configuration and fold back to form an extended β-sheet with the existing β-sheet. We propose that these structures are early chemical events in disease pathogenesis.",Alpha-Synuclein Is a Target of Fic-Mediated Adenylylation/AMPylation: Possible Implications for Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034889,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 10,"During disease, cells experience various stresses that manifest as an accumulation of misfolded proteins and eventually lead to cell death. To combat this stress, cells activate a pathway called unfolded protein response that functions to maintain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and determines cell fate. We recently reported a hitherto unknown mechanism of regulating ER stress via a novel post-translational modification called Fic-mediatedadenylylation/AMPylation. Specifically, we showed that the human Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) protein, HYPE/FicD, catalyzes the addition of an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to the ER chaperone, BiP, to alter the cell's unfolded protein response-mediated response to misfolded proteins. Here, we report that we have now identified a second target for HYPE-alpha-synuclein (αSyn), a presynaptic protein involved in Parkinson's disease. Aggregated αSyn has been shown to induce ER stress and elicit neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease models. We show that HYPE adenylylates αSyn and reduces phenotypes associated with αSyn aggregation invitro, suggesting a possible mechanism by which cells cope with αSyn toxicity.",NMR Resonance Assignment Methodology: Characterizing Large Sparsely Labeled Glycoproteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034888,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 10,"Characterization of proteins using NMR methods begins with assignment of resonances to specific residues. This is usually accomplished using sequential connectivities between nuclear pairs in proteins uniformly labeled with NMR active isotopes. This becomes impractical for larger proteins, and especially for proteins that are best expressed in mammalian cells, including glycoproteins. Here an alternate protocol for the assignment of NMR resonances of sparsely labeled proteins, namely, the ones labeled with a single amino acid type, or a limited subset of types, isotopically enriched with 15N or 13C, is described. The protocol is based on comparison of data collected using extensions of simple two-dimensional NMR experiments (correlated chemical shifts, nuclear Overhauser effects, residual dipolar couplings) to predictions from molecular dynamics trajectories that begin with known protein structures. Optimal pairing of predicted and experimental values is facilitated by a software package that employs a genetic algorithm, ASSIGN_SLP_MD. The approach is applied to the 36-kDa luminal domain of the sialyltransferase, rST6Gal1, in which all phenylalanines are labeled with 15N, and the results are validated by elimination of resonances via single-point mutations of selected phenylalanines to tyrosines. Assignment allows the use of previously published paramagnetic relaxation enhancements to evaluate placement of a substrate analog in the active site of this protein. The protocol will open the way to structural characterization of the many glycosylated and other proteins that are best expressed in mammalian cells.",Fitness Effects of Single Amino Acid Insertions and Deletions in TEM-1 β-Lactamase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034887,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 10,"Short insertions and deletions (InDels) are a common type of mutation found in nature and a useful source of variation in protein engineering. InDel events have important consequences in protein evolution, often opening new pathways for adaptation. However, much less is known about the effects of InDels compared to point mutations and amino acid substitutions. In particular, deep mutagenesis studies on the distribution of fitness effects of mutations have focused almost exclusively on amino acid substitutions. Here, we present a near-comprehensive analysis of the fitness effects of single amino acid InDels in TEM-1 β-lactamase. While we found InDels to be largely deleterious, partially overlapping deletion-tolerant and insertion-tolerant regions were observed throughout the protein, especially in unstructured regions and at the end of helices. The signal sequence of TEM-1 tolerated InDels more than the mature protein. Most regions of the protein tolerated insertions more than deletions, but a few regions tolerated deletions more than insertions. We examined the relationship between InDel tolerance and a variety of measures to help understand its origin. These measures included evolutionary variation in β-lactamases, secondary structure identity, tolerance to amino acid substitutions, solvent accessibility, and side-chain weighted contact number. We found secondary structure, weighted contact number, and evolutionary variation in class A beta-lactamases to be the somewhat predictive of InDel fitness effects.",Analyzing Microbial Population Heterogeneity-Expanding the Toolbox of Microfluidic Single-Cell Cultivations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034885,Journal of molecular biology,2019 05 28,"Recent research on population heterogeneity revealed fascinating insights into microbial behavior.

This review reports recent developments and applications of microfluidic single-cell cultivation technology, highlighting fields of broad interest such as growth, gene expression and antibiotic resistance and susceptibility. Combining advanced microfluidic single-cell cultivation technology for environmental control with automated time-lapse imaging as well as smart computational image analysis offers tremendous potential for novel investigation at the single-cell level.

Genome-wide mutagenesis followed by phenotypic screening represents the ultimate manifestation of this method, directly linking biological phenomena to its corresponding genetic cause. Whilst this has been successful in lower organisms, deployment of genome-wide screens in mammalian systems has been hampered by both limitations of scale and inefficient bi-allelic mutagenesis. CRISPR-Cas9 technology has now largely resolved these issues, whereby delivery of genome-scale gRNA libraries in the presence of gRNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease enables the generation of mutant cell libraries; the perfect platform for performing phenotypic screens. Although the tools are now available for virtually any molecular biology laboratory to conduct such screens, many researchers are daunted by the sheer complexity and scale at which such experiments are performed. This Review will address these concerns, presenting a contextual and practical guide to deploying CRISPR-KO screens in mammalian systems. We will discuss key considerations required in all aspects of screening from initiation to conclusion, which will enable researchers to conduct screens of their own, maximising the potential of this powerful technology."

In spite of the importance of the disease worldwide, the mechanisms of disease development are poorly understood. Secondary metabolites, which are one of the common virulence factors of pathogenic fungi, have not been extensively explored from this fungus. An RNA-seq dataset was examined to find genes responsible for secondary metabolite synthesis by this fungus during infection. One polyketide synthase gene, pks5, was found to be upregulated during the early biotrophic stage of development. In addition to pks5, six other genes adjacent to the pks5 gene, including one encoding a Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor abscisic acid-like 7 gene (abl7), were also upregulated during that time. A striking feature of the L. maculans genome is that it contains large AT-rich regions that are gene-poor and large GC-rich regions that are gene rich. This set of seven co-regulated genes is embedded within and separated by two such AT-rich regions. Three of the genes in the cluster have similarities to those known to be involved in the synthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) in other fungi. When L. maculans is grown in axenic culture the genes in this cluster are not expressed and ABA is not produced. Overexpressing abl7, encoding the putative transcription factor, resulted in the transcription of the six adjacent genes in axenic culture and in the production of ABA, as detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Mutation of two genes of the cluster using CRISPR/Cas9 did not affect pathogenicity on canola cotyledons. The characterization of the ABA gene cluster has led to the discovery of the co-regulation of genes within an AT-rich region by a transcription factor, and the first report of the plant hormone abscisic acid being produced by L. maculans.",Effects of single and combined toxic exposures on the gut microbiome: Current knowledge and future directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034867,Toxicology letters,2019 06 09,"Human populations are chronically exposed to mixtures of toxic chemicals. Predicting the health effects of these mixtures require a large amount of information on the mode of action of their components. Xenobiotic metabolism by bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract has a major influence on human health. Our review aims to explore the literature for studies looking to characterize the different modes of action and outcomes of major chemical pollutants, and some components of cosmetics and food additives, on gut microbial communities in order to facilitate an estimation of their potential mixture effects. We identified good evidence that exposure to heavy metals, pesticides, nanoparticles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, furans, polychlorinated biphenyls, and non-caloric artificial sweeteners affect the gut microbiome and which is associated with the development of metabolic, malignant, inflammatory, or immune diseases. Answering the question 'Who is there?' is not sufficient to define the mode of action of a toxicant in predictive modeling of mixture effects. Therefore, we recommend that new studies focus to simulate real-life exposure to diverse chemicals (toxicants, cosmetic/food additives), including as mixtures, and which combine metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomic analytical methods achieving in that way a comprehensive evaluation of effects on human health.",Effects of abnormal expression of fusion and fission genes on the morphology and function of lung macrophage mitochondria in SiO2-induced silicosis fibrosis in rats in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034866,Toxicology letters,2019 06 09,"Silicosis is a serious occupational disease affecting millions of related workers. Many studies showed lung macrophages play an important role in the disease. However, the changes of macrophages are not fully characterized and the mechanisms need further investigations. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the effects of abnormal expression of fusion and fission genes on the morphology and function of lung macrophage mitochondria in SiO2-induced silicosis fibrosis in rats. In this study, the rats were injected with 1 mL of SiO2 suspension (100 mg/mL) into the lungs to establish silicosis models, and killed after 30, 60, and 120 days. The rats which were injected with normal saline (1 mL) into lungs were used as control. The lungs of rats were taken for pathological observation. Lung macrophages were collected to measure the number, activity, level of MDA and SOD, and relative content of fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2) and fission (Fis, DRP) genes. Subsequently, mitochondria were extracted from the macrophages to measure the changes of function, including MDA, SOD, ATP, and ATPase. We found that silica dust inhalation led to the proliferation of collagen fibers in the lung tissue. During this process, the number and activity of macrophages increased, the degree of lipid peroxidation increased, and the expression of mitochondrial fusion and fission genes was abnormal. Moreover, the mitochondrial lipid peroxidation level in macrophages increased, the production of ATP and the activity of ATPase decreased, and the abnormal forms of mitochondria occurred. Our results indicated that the morphology and function of mitochondria in macrophages changed during the progress of silicosis, which were related to the abnormal expression of fusion and fission genes.",Older women take shorter steps during backwards walking and obstacle crossing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034865,Experimental gerontology,2019 05 28,"Community ambulation requires the ability to adapt walking patterns to task demands. For example, complex walking tasks, such as obstacle crossing (OBS) and backwards walking (BW), require modification of gait kinematics to complete the task, maintain stability and prevent falling. More women than men fall each year, but few studies have investigated gender differences in performance of adaptive walking tasks.","Consequences of inadequate sleep during the college years: Sleep deprivation, grade point average, and college graduation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034864,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"Sleep deprivation can have substantial consequences for college learning and achievement. However, prior studies on this topic are limited due to the reliance on small and convenience samples, the use of cross-sectional data, inadequate control for confounders, and the lack of outcome data from official school records. The present study used two waves of longitudinal data from the U.S. Wabash National Study (N = 3549) to examine the relationships between sleep deprivation and school-record grade point average (GPA) and college graduation. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to link sleep deprivation and GPA. Logistic regression was used to link sleep deprivation during the college years and college graduation. Results from the random-effects and fixed-effects models suggest that chronic sleep deprivation is associated with lower GPA. Students who experienced sleep deprivation from their freshman to senior years had a lower chance of graduation than students who were not sleep deprived. Furthermore, sleep deprivation during students' senior year was found to be more consequential for college graduation than sleep deprivation during their freshman year. Findings suggest that the ramifications of chronic sleep deprivation extend beyond short-term GPA; sleep deprivation predicts the likelihood of obtaining a college degree.",Uncertainty of fetal fraction determination in Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening by highly polymorphic SNPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034863,Journal of biotechnology,2019 05 21,"Fetal fraction and the chromosome representation are the two key quantities used in Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) to determine the aneuploidy status of a fetus. Several methods for fetal fraction determination have been proposed in the literature, including a class of the methods, denoted snpFF, based on high-coverage targeted sequencing of highly polymorphic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The variant of snpFF, investigated here, has similar properties as the other variants of snpFF. We point out that the variability of the individual informative SNPs-based estimates of fetal fraction increases with the increase of fetal fraction. At 4% fetal fraction the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) of the individual estimates of fetal fraction is around 3% and it increases to 6% at 15% fetal fraction. snpFF cannot detect fetal fraction below 2.5% because the number of informative SNPs becomes too small, even zero.",Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) affects hemocyte intracellular signaling pathways to regulate exocytosis and immune response in white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034862,Peptides,2019 05 25,"Recombinant Litopenaeus vannamei CHH (rLvCHH) was obtained from a bacterial expression system and the intracellular signaling pathways involved in exocytosis and immune response after rLvCHH injection (0.2 and 2 μg/shrimp) was investigated in this study. The results showed that CHH contents increased 51.4%-110.2% (0.2 μg/shrimp) and 65.0%-211.3% (2 μg/shrimp) of the control level. And the contents of three biogenic amines in hemolymph presented a similar variation pattern after rLvCHH injection, but reached the highest level at different time points. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase (mGC) (1.20-1.93 fold) and biogenic amine receptors, including type 2 dopamine receptor (DA2R) (0.72-0.89 fold), α2 adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) (0.72-0.91 fold) and 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) (1.37-3.49 fold) in hemocytes were changed consistently with their ligands. In addition, the second messenger and protein kinases shared a similar trend and reached the maximum at the same time respectively. The expression levels of nuclear transcription factor (cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB) and exocytosis-related proteins transcripts were basically overexpressed after rLvCHH stimulation, which reached the peaks at 1 h or 3 h. Eventually, the phenoloxidase (PO) activity (37.4%-158.5%) and antibacterial activity (31.8%-122.3%) in hemolymph were dramatically enhanced within 6 h, while the proPO activity in hemocytes significantly decreased (11.2%-62.6%). Collectively, these results indicate that shrimps L. vannamei could carry out a simple but 'smart' NEI regulation by releasing different neuroendocrine factors at different stages after rLvCHH stimulation, which could couple with their receptors and trigger the downstream signaling pathways during the immune responses in hemocytes.",Genome editing-based approaches for imaging protein localization and dynamics in the mammalian brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034861,Neuroscience research,2019 05 19,"A neuron contains thousands of proteins, each of which mediates neuronal processes at distinct subcellular compartments. Thus, precise mapping of each protein with subcellular resolution in the brain is essential to understand neuronal processes at the molecular level. However, no conventional methods have provided rapid, generalizable, and high-throughput readouts for the subcellular localization of endogenous proteins in the mammalian brain. Recently, new methods based on in vivo genome editing have been developed for high-throughput determination of the protein localization with high specificity, resolution and contrast in mammalian brain tissue. In this review, I first describe the merits and demerits of each conventional method for imaging the protein localization in the brain. I then introduce the new genome editing-based methods to discuss their advantages, limitations and future potential in molecular and cellular neuroscience research.",Can People Accurately Estimate the Calories in Food Images? An Optimised Set of Low- and High- Calorie Images from the food-pics database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034860,Appetite,2019 06 08,"Calorie intake plays an important role in maintaining a healthy weight. As such, researchers often use the calorie content of food as a distinction when investigating appetite related brain processes and eating behaviour. This distinction assumes that observers accurately perceive caloric content. However, there is evidence suggesting this is not always the case. The current study examined how accurately observers could estimate the caloric content of food images from the widely used ""Food-pics"" database. Eight hundred and forty psychology undergraduate students (aged 16-60, 64% female) estimated the caloric value of 178 high and 182 low calorie foods. Calorie content of food from both categories was significantly overestimated. Additionally, 7.7% of low calorie images were misperceived as being high calorie images and 35% of high calorie images were misperceived as being low calorie foods. Neither participants' gender, nor the recognisability and likability of the food images, influenced calorie estimation. Our findings show that most people are unable to accurately estimate caloric content of most food. Despite this, a selection of food images were judged accurately, and we advocate the use of these in research where it is important to have low- and high-calorie food images. Specifically, we propose an optimised stimulus set of 25 high and 25 low calorie food images that are accurately judged by adult participants. In addition, we provide the open source dataset of our ratings of Food-pics images which, when added to the existing Food-pics attributes, creates an enhanced tool for researchers selecting food stimuli."

It possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-neoplastic properties and shows potentials in treating or preventing particular diseases such as oxidative and inflammatory conditions, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, anxiety, hyperlipidemia and cancers. The diverse range and potential health beneficial effects has generated enthusiasm leading to intensive investigation into the phytochemical. However, a concern has been also raised if curcumin has a promiscuous bioassay profile and is a Pan-Assay INterference compound (PAINS). Here we present evidence indicating that curcumin is not a PAINS, but an inhibitor to APE1 redox function that affects many genes and pathways. This discovery explains the wide range of effects of curcumin on diverse human diseases and predicts a potential application in treatment of viral infection and virus-associated cancer. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that curcumin is able to efficiently block Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus replication and inhibit the pathogenic processes of angiogenesis and cell invasion.",Variability of ferulenol and ferprenin concentration in French giant fennel (Ferula sp.) leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034847,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 08,"Few studies have reported quantitative data about the levels of prenylated coumarins in Ferula sp. Yet, the toxicity of Ferula sp. is only due to the presence of prenylated coumarins and to their concentrations and all studies suggest the existence of several chemotypes within the same species or even within the same variety. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis of different chemotypes in french Ferula sp. in relationship with the botanical species. In this objective, the species of giant fennels and their concentrations in prenylated coumarins were explored. Three different species or subspecies of giant fennel were detected in continental France: F. communis communis communis L., F. communis catalaunica microcarpa Cauwet-Marc and F. glauca L. Surprisingly, the three species/subspecies of giant fennels were found to be located in exclusive and well separated geographical areas. In French giant fennels, ferulenol and ferprenin were detected. Distribution of ferulenol and ferprenin were found to be different between botanical varieties, but also according to the season, the soil and the altitude. Our study seems to suggest that among F. communis species, the same plant can be regarded as poisonous at one point and another as non-poisonous.",Nephrotoxicity induced by the venom of Hypnale hypnale from Sri Lanka: Studies on isolated perfused rat kidney and renal tubular cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034846,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 08,"The hump-nosed pit viper Hypnale hypnale is responsible for a high number of snakebite cases in southwestern India and Sri Lanka. Although most patients only develop local signs and symptoms of envenoming, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that these envenomings may be associated with systemic alterations, including acute kidney injury. In this study we evaluated the renal toxicity of H. hypnale venom by using a perfused isolated rat kidney system and by assessing cytotoxicity in two different renal tubular cell lines in culture. The venom caused alterations in several renal functional parameters, such as reduction on perfusion pressure, renal vascular resistance, and sodium and chloride tubular transport, whereas glomerular filtration rate and urinary flow initially decreased and then increased after venom perfusion. In addition, this venom was cytotoxic to proximal and distal renal tubular cells in culture, with predominance of necrosis over apoptosis. Moreover, the venom affected the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced an increment in reactive oxygen species in these cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a nephrotoxic activity of H. hypnale venom in these experimental models, in agreement with clinical observations.",Predicting miRNA-lncRNA interactions and recognizing their regulatory roles in stress response of plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034845,Mathematical biosciences,2019 05 19,"It has been found that each non-coding RNA (ncRNA) can act not only through its target gene, but also interact with each other to act on biological traits, and this interaction is more common. Many studies focus mainly on the analysis of microRNA(miRNA) and message RNA (mRNA) interactions. In this study, we investigated miRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) interactions using support vector regression (SVR) for prediction of new target genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and identify some regulatory roles in stress response. The networks of miRNA-mRNA, miRNA-lncRNA and miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA were constructed. They were further analyzed and interpreted in R. We showed that miRNA with low sequence number, targeted lncRNA with high sequence number and miRNA with high sequence number targeted lncRNA with low sequence number. The experimental results showed that there is a regulatory relationship between miRNA-lncRNA. New RNA targets were predicted using SVR with new gene expression mechanism and the stress related functions were annotated.",Probiotic treatment restores normal developmental trajectories of fear memory retention in maternally separated infant rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034844,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 31,"Early life stress (ELS) can affect brain development and increase lifetime prevalence of psychiatric illnesses. However, the effective therapeutic interventions to ameliorate the deleterious effects of ELS have not yet been well established. Here, we confirmed that maternal separation (MS) for 3 h daily between postnatal days 2-14, a frequently used experimental model of ELS, resulted in early expression of adult-like fear memory retention in male infant rats. Administration of a probiotic formulation, Lacidofil® (95% Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and 5% Lactobacillus helveticus R0052), during the separation period, prevented the precocious transition to adult-like fear memory retention in MS infant rats. Consonant with this effect, probiotic treatment also ameliorated the MS-induced increases in anxiety-like behavior as measured by the elevated plus maze and the light-dark box tests. In addition, probiotic treatment reduced MS-induced increases in neuronal activation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) after auditory fear conditioning. Furthermore, we found that probiotic treatment significantly rescued the heightened hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to restraint stress in MS infant rats. Taken together, these findings suggest that probiotics can restore normal developmental trajectories of fear memory retention in MS infant rats, at least in part by normalizing HPA axis abnormalities, and that the BLA serves as a critical node to mediate these interventions. Thus, we offer a potential therapeutic intervention to protect children against the harmful effects of ELS.","Impact of Varroa destructor and deformed wing virus on emergence, cellular immunity, wing integrity and survivorship of Africanized honey bees in Mexico.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034843,Journal of invertebrate pathology,2019 05 27,"The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor is the primary health problem of honey bees (Apis mellifera) worldwide. Africanized honey bees in Brazil have demonstrated tolerance to the mite, but there is controversy about the degree of mite tolerance of Africanized bees in other countries. This study was conducted to quantify the effect of V. destructor parasitism on emergence, hemocyte concentration, wing integrity and longevity of Africanized honey bees in Mexico. Africanized bee brood were artificially infested with V. destructor mites and held in an incubator until emergence as adults and compared to non-infested controls. Deformed wing virus (DWV) presence was determined in the mites used to infest the bees. After emergence, the bees were maintained in an incubator to determine survivorship. The percentage of worker bees that emerged from parasitized cells (69%) was significantly lower than that of bees emerged from non-infested cells (96%). Newly-emerged parasitized bees had a significantly lower concentration of hemocytes in the hemolymph than non-parasitized bees. Additionally, the proportion of bees with deformed wings that emerged from V. destructor-parasitized cells was significantly higher (54%) than that of the control group (0%). The mean survival time of bees that emerged from infested and non-infested cells was 8.5 ± 0.3 and 14.4 ± 0.4 days, respectively, and the difference was significant. We conclude that V. destructor parasitism and DWV infections kill, cause deformities and inhibit cellular immunity in developing Africanized honey bees, and significantly reduce the lifespan of adult bees in Mexico. These results suggest that the tolerance of Africanized bees to V. destructor is related to adult bee mechanisms.",Pheromone extracts act as boosters for entomopathogenic nematodes efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034842,Journal of invertebrate pathology,2019 05 27,"Inconsistency in entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) efficacy is still one of the biggest challenges for the wider adoption of EPNs as biocontrol agents. Previous studies demonstrated that extracts from EPN-infected hosts enhance dispersal and efficacy, two key factors in success of EPNs. Some active components in the insect host cadavers responsible for dispersal, ascarosides, have been identified as nematode pheromones. We hypothesized that pheromone extracts increase dispersal of EPN infective juveniles (IJs) leading to increased efficacy. First, we determined whether pheromone extracts improved IJ movement/dispersal in soil columns baited with Tenebrio molitor larvae. We found that pheromone extracts induced higher numbers of Steinernema carpocapsae and Steinernema feltiae IJs to move towards T. molitor larvae in the bottom of the column compared to IJs treated with infected cadaver macerate and water, positive and negative controls, respectively. Furthermore, the number of S. carpocapsae IJs that invaded T. molitor larvae was higher for the pheromone extract treatment than the controls. S. feltiae IJs that were pretreated with pheromone extracts and macerate (positive control) infected T. molitor at the same rate but invasion was superior to IJs that were treated with water. Consistent with the soil column tests, both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae IJs treated with pheromone extracts performed better in killing larvae of two economically important insect larvae, pecan weevil, Curculio caryae, and black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, in greenhouse tests compared to IJs treated with water. We demonstrated pheromone-mediated behavioral manipulation of a biological control agent to enhance pest control potential. Conceivably, nematodes can be exposed to efficacy-enhancing pheromones prior to field application.",Dissociating neural activity associated with the subjective phenomenology of monocular stereopsis: An EEG study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034841,Neuropsychologia,2019 06 16,"The subjective phenomenology associated with stereopsis, of solid tangible objects separated by a palpable negative space, is conventionally thought to be a by-product of the derivation of depth from binocular disparity. However, the same qualitative impression has been reported in the absence of disparity, e.g., when viewing pictorial images monocularly through an aperture. Here we aimed to explore if we could identify dissociable neural activity associated with the qualitative impression of stereopsis in the absence of the processing of binocular disparities. We measured EEG activity while subjects viewed pictorial (non-stereoscopic) images of 2D and 3D geometric forms under four different viewing conditions (binocular, monocular, binocular aperture, monocular aperture). EEG activity was analysed by oscillatory source localization (beamformer technique) to examine power change in occipital and parietal regions across viewing and stimulus conditions in targeted frequency bands (alpha: 8-13 Hz & gamma: 60-90 Hz). We observed expected event-related gamma synchronization and alpha desynchronization in occipital cortex and predominant gamma synchronization in parietal cortex across viewing and stimulus conditions. However, only the viewing condition predicted to generate the strongest impression of stereopsis (monocular aperture) revealed significantly elevated gamma synchronization within the parietal cortex for the critical contrasts (3D vs. 2D form). These findings suggest dissociable neural processes specific to the qualitative impression of stereopsis as distinguished from disparity processing.","Fat, carbohydrate and protein by oral gavage in the rat can be equally effective for satiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034840,Physiology & behavior,2019 06 02,"This study aimed to determine the relative efficacy of the macronutrients, protein, fat and carbohydrate to induce satiation and satiety in rats in relation to macronutrient activation of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Male Sprague Dawley rats were schedule-fed twice a day for 2 h, receiving 100% of daily ad-libitum energy intake. On test day 1, 30 min before the first scheduled meal of the day, rats were gavaged with an 8 kcal isocaloric, isovolumetric solution of a glucose, lipid or peptone macronutrient solution or a non-caloric saline solution. To assess satiation, thirty minutes later rats were given access to food for 2 h and food intake determined. A second 2 h food access period 3 h later was used for assessment of satiety. On the second test day, rats were gavaged as before and killed 90 min after food presentation. Blood was collected for measurement of circulating metabolic markers. Brains were removed for analysis of c-Fos expression by in situ hybridization in the NTS. Rats which received saline consumed a similar amount of food compared to pre-gavage intakes. However, rats gavaged with a caloric macronutrient solution all reduced food intake by 18-20 kcal. Interestingly, the reduction in caloric intake was greater than the caloric value of the macronutrient solution gavaged and was sustained following the second scheduled meal. Quantification by in situ hybridization of c-Fos mRNA expression in the NTS 90 min post-gavage, showed a significant increase with each macronutrient, but was 24-29% higher with a lipid or peptone gavage compared to a glucose gavage. In conclusion, when delivered directly to the stomach, all macronutrients can be equally effective in inducing satiation with significant neuronal activation in the NTS of the hindbrain.",CC chemokine receptor 2 functions in osteoblastic transformation of valvular interstitial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034839,Life sciences,2019 05 22,"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) emerges as a challenging clinical issue, which is associated with high cardiovascular mortality.

The purpose of the research was to investigate anti-paroxysmal activity of levetiracetam (LEV) on the model of cobalt-induced chronic epilepsy caused by the application of cobalt to the sensorimotor area of the rat cortex to evaluate LEV impact on the different stages of epileptogenesis. LEV effects were studied at the initial stage of the epileptogenesis (2nd day after the cobalt application) and at the stage of generalized paroxysmal activity (6th day after the cobalt application). The research showed that levetiracetam administration (dosages 50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) at the early stage of the epileptogenesis had no statistically significant effect on the development of paroxysmal activity in both primary and secondary epileptic areas: in the ipsi- and contralateral cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. LEV administration on 6th day (dosage 50 mg/kg) did not have statistical effect on the epileptogenesis, while at a dosage of 200 mg/kg on 6th day LEV significantly suppressed paroxysmal activity in the studied structures of rats with cobalt epilepsy. The strongest anti-paroxysmal effect was detected in hippocampus and was expressed as the normalization of bioelectrical activity and the appearance of a regular theta rhythm. Thus, LEV effects are mostly directed to the hippocampal area of epileptiform activity and, to a lesser extent, to the cortical area.",Circulating Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Tumor Cells With Loss of Heterozygosity in the TSC2 Gene Show Increased Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034819,Chest,2019 06 01,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive metastasizing neoplasm of the lung characterized by proliferation of LAM cells in specialized lung nodules.

Due to the differences between the pediatric and adult populations, tissue reconstruction in pediatric patients requires a substantially different approach from those in adults. Cardiovascular anatomy of children with congenital heart defect vary, which requires tailored surgical operations for each patient. Since grafts used in these palliative surgeries are sensitive to the local hemodynamic environments, their geometries need to be precisely designed to ensure long-term performance. Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) have made tremendous progress over the past decade, but it remains difficult to fabricate patient- and operation-specific vascular grafts. This review summarizes historical milestones of TEVG development for repairing pediatric congenital defects and current clinical outcomes. We also highlight ongoing works on 3D bioprinting of TEVGs with complex geometries and address the current limitations of each technique. Although 3D bioprinted vascular grafts with appropriate functions are yet to be developed, some of the current researches are promising to create better patient specific tissue engineered vascular grafts in the future.",Preliminary studies on in vitro methods for the evaluation of anticoccidial efficacy/resistance in ruminants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034815,Experimental parasitology,2019 06 04,"Ovine Eimeria spp. infections cause increased mortality, reduced welfare and substantial economic losses, and anticocccidials are important for their control. Recent reports of anticoccidial resistance against ovine Eimeria spp. necessitate the development of in vitro methods for the detection of reduced anticoccidial efficacy, especially since the in vivo methods are both expensive, time consuming and requires the use of otherwise healthy animals. The aim of the present study was therefore to approach a preliminary standardization of in vitro assays for evaluation of the efficacy of the most commonly used anticoccidials in ruminants. For this purpose, apart from the evaluation of inhibition of oocyst sporulation, most effort was concentrated on assessment of the capacity of the different anticoccidials to inhibit both the invasion and further development (up to the first schizogony) of E. ninakohlyakimovae sporozoites in bovine colonic epithelial cells (BCEC). For this purpose, infected cultures were monitored 1, 8 and 15 days post infection to determine the infection rate, number of immature schizonts and number, size and appearance of mature schizonts, respectively. No clear inhibitory effect was found with any of the anticoccidial formulations tested, and we could not identify why there were no measurable effects from the different anticoccidials. Despite the lack of positive results, further investigations should be encouraged, as this could decrease the need for animal experiments and could be used in the initial assessment of anticoccidial efficacy of new drugs.",In vitro assessment of synergistic combinations of essential oils against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034814,Experimental parasitology,2019 06 04,"Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae), is one of the most important ectoparasite of cattle, responsible for causing severe economic losses in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world.

Also, various combinations were prepared by mixing of equal concentrations of any two and all three EOs and used to study the effects of interactions of mixtures against larvae of R. (B.) microplus. The lethal concentrations at 50% (LC50), 90% (LC90) and 99% (LC99) with 95% confidence limits (CL) were estimated by Probit analysis using PoloPlus. The computer software, CompuSyn, was used for determining the effects of interactions (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) of EO mixtures by calculation of Combination index (CI) and Dose-reduction index (DRI). Among the individual and mixture of two EOs, cinnamon EO and cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO combination showed highest acaricidal activity against R. (B.) microplus larvae. Further, the combination of cinnamon EO + lemon grass EO showed high synergism with CI value of 0.381, followed by cinnamon EO + clove EO showing moderate synergism whereas, clove EO + lemon grass EO showed only additive effect, with favorable dose reduction for each constituent drug in all three combinations. The combination of all three EOs (1:1:1) showed high synergism (CI value of 0.376) and favorable dose reduction (DRI index of 8.19, 25.64 and 4.64 for clove, cinnamon and lemon grass EOs, respectively) against R. (B.) microplus larvae.",Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation is a reversible and frequency-dependent modulator of the blood-brain barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034813,Brain research,2019 06 10,"The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is a vasoactive mediator of the anterior intracranial circulation in mammals.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether and how melatonin protects rabbit spermatozoa against ROS stress during cryopreservation. Semen was diluted with Tris-citrate-glucose extender in presence of different concentrations of melatonin. It was observed that addition of 0.1 mM melatonin significantly improved spermatozoa motility, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential as well as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Meanwhile, the lipid peroxidation (LPO), ROS levels and apoptosis of post-thaw spermatozoa were reduced in presence of melatonin. Interestingly, when fresh spermatozoa were incubated with 100 μM H2O2, addition of 0.1 mM melatonin significantly decreased the oxidative damage compared to the H2O2 treatment, whereas addition of luzindole, an MT1 receptor inhibitor, decrease the effect of melatonin in spermatozoa. It was observed that the glutathione (GSH) content and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly increased with addition of melatonin during cryopreservation. In conclusion, addition of melatonin to the freezing extender protects rabbit spermatozoa against ROS attack by enhancing AMPK phosphorylation for increasing the antioxidative defense.",A new vitrification device that absorbs excess vitrification solution adaptable to a closed system for the cryopreservation of mouse embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034811,Cryobiology,2019 05 27,"Several closed vitrification devices that avoid contact with liquid nitrogen have been reported. Recently, based on the Kitasato Vitrification System (KVS), we developed the Closed-KVS, which is a closed vitrification device. The KVS is an open vitrification device that can absorb excess vitrification solution. In this study, we performed two experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the Closed-KVS as a vitrification device for the cryopreservation of mouse embryos at the blastocyst and two-cell stage. In the first experiment, the blastocysts were vitrified using either the Closed-KVS or the KVS (control device). The survival, re-expansion, and hatching rates were not significantly different between embryos vitrified using the Closed-KVS and those vitrified using the KVS. In the second experiment, we evaluated the embryonic development of the two-cell stage embryos vitrified using the Closed-KVS. There were no significant differences in the survival, blastocyst formation, or hatching rates between vitrified or non-vitrified embryos. Additionally, we evaluated the cooling and warming rates of these devices using a numerical simulation method. The cooling rates of the Closed-KVS were similar regardless of whether the outer cap was pre-cooled and were lower than those of the KVS. However, the warming rates of the Closed-KVS (irrespective of cap pre-cooling) were the same as those of the KVS (612,000 °C/min). In summary, the Closed-KVS is a novel closed vitrification device for the cryopreservation of mouse embryos at the blastocyst and two-cell stage.",Effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication and high-density lipoprotein on the risk of de novo gastric cancer development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034810,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 04 29,"The effect of Helicobacter pylori eradication on de novo gastric cancer is controversial, although meta-analyses suggest a reduction in gastric cancer after eradication.

Here, a portable detection strategy based on a personal glucose meter (PGM) was designed for meeting this purpose. In this strategy, the anti-EpCAM coated magnet beads (MBs) were used as capture probes for enriching cancer cells and the aptamer modified and invertase loaded graphene oxides (GO) were used as report probes for producing glucose signal. This method is sensitive with detection limit as low as 560 cells, and demonstrates excellent detection specificity. Meanwhile, we succeeded in the specific detection of target cells in 20% human serum samples, indicating this method has great prospect in clinical diagnosis. Moreover, this method presents favourable universality for detecting different colorectal cancer cells by just using different recognition aptamers. Importantly, this method can be implemented for the target cell detection at room temperature without any expensive and large-scale instruments but a portable PGM. Therefore, this portable detection method possesses great potential in point-of-care detection of colorectal cancer cells.",Exploring deeper genetic structures: Aedes aegypti in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034798,Acta tropica,2019 05 28,"Aedes aegypti, being the principal vector of dengue (DENV1 to 4), chikungunya and Zika viruses, is considered as one of the most important mosquito vectors. In Brazil, despite regular vector control programs, Ae. aegypti still persists with high urban density in all the states. This study aimed to estimate the intra and inter population genetic diversity and genetic structure among 15 Brazilian populations of Ae. aegypti based on 12 microsatellite loci. A total of 510 specimens were analyzed comprising eight locations from northern (Itacoatiara, Manaus, Novo Airão, Boa Vista, Rio Branco, Porto Velho, Guajará-Mirim and Macapá), three from southeastern (Araçatuba, São José de Rio Preto and Taubaté), one from southern (Foz do Iguaçu), one from central west (Cuiabá) and two from northeastern (Campina Grande and Teresina) regions of Brazil. Genetic distances (pairwise values of FST and Nm) and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were statistically significant, independent of geographic distances among the sites analyzed, indicating that them are under a complex dynamic process that influence the levels of gene flow within and among regions of the country. Bayesian analysis in STRUCTURE revealed the existence of two major genetic clusters, as well as there was genetic substructure within them; these results were confirmed by AMOVA, BAPS and DAPC analyses. This differentiation is the cumulative result of several factors combined as events of multiple introduction, passive dispersal, environmental and climatic conditions, use of insecticides, cycles of extinction and re-colonization followed by microevolutionary processes throughout the country. Isolation by distance also contributed to this differentiation, especially among geographically closer localities. These genetic differences may affect its vector competence to transmit dengue, chikungunya, Zika and the response to vector control programs.",Activation of G protein-coupled receptor 30 by flavonoids leads to expression of acetylcholinesterase in cultured PC12 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034797,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 05,"Flavonoids, considered as phytoestrogen mainly deriving from fruit and vegetable, are known to have beneficial effects in brain functions. The role of flavonoids in induction of a cholinergic enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), was being explored here. In cultured PC12 cells, twenty-four commonly found flavonoids were tested for its induction on AChE activity. Fourteen flavonoids showed induction, and five of them had robust effect, i.e. daidzin, alpinetin, irisflorentin, cardamonin and lysionotin. The induction of AChE was fully blocked by pre-treatment of G15 (a selective G protein-coupled receptor 30 [GPR 30] antagonist), suggesting a direct involvement of a membrane-bound estrogen receptor, named as GPR 30, in the cultures. In addition, daidzin was further identified to induce expression of tetrameric globular form of proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA)-linked AChE. In parallel, application of daidzin in cultured PC12 cells significantly induced expression of neurofilaments, markers for neuronal differentiation. Taken together, flavonoids could induce the expression of AChE via GPR 30 in cultured PC12 cells, which could be a good candidate for possible treatment of the brain diseases.",Treatment of giant cell arteritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034796,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 06 10,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of vasculitis in adults. Cranial manifestations are typical clinical features of this vasculitis. Sometimes the presenting symptoms are nonspecific and, in some cases, large-vessel involvement may prevail. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a frequent manifestation that in some cases may be the presenting symptom of GCA. Visual complications, in particular the risk of blindness, constitute the most feared manifestations of GCA. Prompt recognition of this vasculitis is required to avoid irreversible complications. Prednisone/prednisolone at a dose of 40-60 mg/day is the cornerstone therapy in GCA. Glucocorticoids lead to rapid improvement of symptoms and may reduce the risk of irreversible visual loss. However, relapses are common when the prednisone dose is tapered. Therefore, additional therapies are required in relapsing GCA or when a rapid reduction of glucocorticoids is needed. The most widely used conventional immunosuppressive drug is methotrexate Adjunctive treatment with methotrexate may decrease the risk of relapses and reduce glucocorticoid exposure. However, comprehensive reviews indicate that the efficacy of methotrexate in GCA is modest. The experience with other conventional immunosuppressive drugs in GCA patients is scarce. In some cases, the new biologic agents are required. Among them, the most frequently used is the recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. It improves clinical symptoms, reduce the cumulative prednisone dose and the frequency of relapses in GCA patients. However, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy is not useful in GCA. Promising results on other biologic agents, such as abatacept, ustekinumab or anakinra, require further confirmatory studies.",New insights of poly(ADP-ribosylation) in neurodegenerative diseases: A focus on protein phase separation and pathologic aggregation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034795,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Abnormal protein aggregation is a common pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial regulatory role in the formation of pathologic aggregation. Among the known PTMs involved in neurodegeneration, poly(ADP-ribosylation) (PARylation) has emerged with promising therapeutic potentials of the use of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In this review, we describe the mounting evidence that abnormal PARP activation is involved in various neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss the underpinning mechanisms with a focus on the recent findings that PARylation affects liquid-liquid phase separation and aggregation of amyloid proteins. We hope this review will stimulate further investigation of the unknown functions of PARylation and promote the development of more effective therapeutic agents in treating neurodegeneration.",Induction of typical and atypical neurogenesis in the adult substantia nigra after mouse embryonic stem cells transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034794,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Neurogenesis in the substantia nigra (SN) has been a controversial issue. Here we report that neurogenesis can be induced in the adult rodent SN by transplantation of embryoid body cells (EBCs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. The detection of Sox2+ dividing (BrdU+) putative host neural precursor cells (NPCs) between 1 and 6 days post-transplantation (dpt) supported the neurogenic capacity of the adult SN. In agreement with the awakening of NPCs by EBCs, only host cells from implant-bearing SN were able to generate neurosphere-like aggregates in the presence of Egf and Fgf2. Later, at 15 dpt, a significant number of SN Dcx+ neuroblasts were detected. However, a continuous BrdU administration after transplantation showed that only a fraction (about 20-30%) of those host Dcx+ progeny derived from dividing cells and few BrdU+ cells, some of them NeuN+, survived up to 30 dpt. Unexpectedly, 25-30% of Dcx+ or Psa-Ncam+ cells at 15 dpt displayed astrocytic markers such as Gfap and S100b. Using a genetic lineage tracing strategy, we demonstrated that a large proportion of host Dcx+ and/or Tubb3+ neuroblasts originated from Gfap+ cells. Remarkably, new blood vessels formed in association with the neurogenic process that, when precluded, caused a reduction in neuroblast production. Accordingly, two proteins secreted by EBCs, Fgf2 and Vegf, were able to promote the emergence of Dcx+/Psa-Ncam+, Tubb3+ and NeuN+/BrdU+ cells in vivo in the absence of EBCs. We propose that the adult SN is a mostly silent neurogenic niche with the ability to generate new neurons by typical and atypical mechanisms.",Does Mandible-First Sequencing Increase Maxillary Surgical Accuracy in Bimaxillary Procedures?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034793,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,2019 05 12,"In bimaxillary procedures, it is important to know how the chosen sequence affects the surgical outcome.

However, environmental stressors are expected to affect both males and females, and the strength of sexual selection might be affected by changes in female mating decisions, a hypothesis that has rarely been tested. Here, we investigated whether female common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) mating behaviour and mating preferences are affected by different levels of administered corticosterone and conditioned by the familiarity of their partners, which is known to influence Z. vivipara social behaviour. To this end, two females, one corticosterone-treated and one control female, were simultaneously presented with an unfamiliar male and the following day with either a familiar or an unfamiliar male. Females treated with corticosterone (Cort) were more aggressive towards males and mated less. Furthermore, copulation probability in Cort females, but not in control females, increased with body size. On the second day, Cort females only mated with familiar partners. In contrast, male behaviour towards females was not affected by treatment and only bigger males successfully copulated with Cort females. This shows that corticosterone directly affected female mating behaviour and mating preferences, while male mating behaviour was unaffected by the female's level of corticosterone. Environmental and social stressors may affect reproductive strategies of females, the strength of sexual selection, and sexual conflict through their effects on female glucocorticoid levels, potentially in a wide range of species.",Mating barriers between genetically divergent strains of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus suggest incipient speciation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034791,International journal for parasitology,2019 06 15,"Haemonchus contortus, in common with many nematode species, has extremely high levels of genetic variation within and between field populations derived from distant geographical locations. MHco10(CAVR), MHco3(ISE) and MHco4(WRS) are genetically divergent H. contortus strains, originally derived from Australia, Kenya and South Africa, respectively, that have been maintained by numerous rounds of in vivo experimental infection of sheep. In order to explore potential pre-zygotic competition or post-zygotic incompatibility between the strains, we have investigated the ability of MHco10(CAVR) to interbreed with either MHco3(ISE) or MHco4(WRS) during dual strain co-infections. Sheep were experimentally co-infected with 4000 infective larvae (L3) per os of the MHco10(CAVR) strain and an equal number of either the MHco3(ISE) or the MHco4(WRS) strain L3. The adult worm establishement rates and the proportions of F1 progeny resulting from intra- and inter-strain mating events were determined by admixture analysis of microsatellite multi-locus genotypes. Although there was no difference in adult worm establishment rates, the proportions of F1 progeny of both the MHco10(CAVR) × MHco3(ISE) and MHco10(CAVR) × MHco4(WRS) dual strain co-infections departed from Mendelian expectations. The proportions of inter-strain hybrid F1 progeny were lower than the expected 50%, suggesting either pre-zygotic competition or post-zygotic incompatibility between the co-infecting strains. To investigate this further, both eggs and hatched L1 of broods from single adult female worms recovered from each dual co-infection were genotyped. Unhatched eggs from the broods revealed no inter-strain hybrid genotype deficit, suggesting there is no pre-zygotic competition between the strains. In contrast, there was a deficit in L1 inter-strain hybrid genotypes in the broods derived from MHco3(ISE) or MHco4(WRS) maternal parents, but not from MHco10(CAVR) maternal parents. This suggests that hybrid progeny of MHco10(CAVR) paternal parents have reduced post-zygotic development and/or viability consistent with incipient speciation of the MHco10(CAVR) strain. The presence of mating barriers between allopatric H. contortus strains has important implications for parasite ecology, including the ability of newly introduced anthelmintic-resistant parasite populations to compete and interbreed with populations already established in a region.",Systematic Review of Newborn Feeding Method and Outcomes Related to Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034790,"Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",2019 06 15,To critically appraise and synthesize existing studies on the relationship between newborn feeding method and neonatal outcomes related to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).

Furthermore, the immunologic effects of the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc (MVC), despite approval for clinical use, have not yet been well evaluated for their potential effects on cytotoxic T-cell responses. In this study, we characterized the development and function of CCR5+CD8+ T cells in rhesus macaques with or without Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. We also investigated the effects of the CCR5 antagonist MVC on functional CCR5+CD8+ T-cell responses in vitro. The data show that CCR5+CD8+ T cells have an effector memory phenotype and increase with age in systemic and mucosal lymphoid tissues as a heterogeneous population of polyfunctional CD8 T cells. In addition, CCR5 is highly expressed on SIV gag-specific (CM9+) CD8+ T cells in SIV-infected macaques, yet CCR5+CD8+ T cells are significantly reduced in mucosal lymphoid tissues with disease progression. Furthermore, in vitro MVC treatment reduced activation and cytokine secretion of CD8+ T cells via a CCR5-independent pathway. These findings suggest that surface CCR5 protein plays an important role in differentiation and activation of CD8+ T cells. Although MVC may be helpful in reducing chronic inflammation and activation, it may also inhibit virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus optimal use of CCR5 antagonists either alone or in combination with other drugs should be defined by further investigation.-Wang, X., Russell-Lodrigue, K. E., Ratterree, M. S., Veazey, R.

However, no genetic mutation from human patients with AF has been linked to inflammation. Here, we show that AF-associated human variant p.Ile138Thr in natriuretic peptide A (NPPA) encoding the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) causes inflammation, fibroblast activation, atrial fibrosis, and AF in knock-in (KI) rats. Variant p.Ile138Thr inhibits the interaction between ANP and its receptor natriuretic peptide receptor A and reduces intracellular cGMP levels. RNA sequencing and follow-up analyses showed that mutant ANP (mANP) activates multiple innate immunity pathways, including TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-1β signaling. mANP induces differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to myofibroblasts and promotes CF proliferation and fibrosis. These results suggest that NPPA variant p.Ile138Thr causes AF by activating TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-1β signaling, inflammation, and fibrosis. Multiple computational programs suggest that p.Ile138Thr is damaging or deleterious. Based on the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Standards and Guidelines, p.Ile138Thr can be classified as a likely pathogenic variant.

The film could be free-standing on water and suspended in air with high transparency and enhanced electrical and mechanical properties compared to that of a monolayer graphene film. The flexible transparent a-PAN/G films were demonstrated as active materials for sensitive pressure sensors.

B,2019 05 23,"α-Synuclein (α-syn) is found to be naturally present in biofluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein found in these biofluids, which, beyond transporting hormones and drugs, also exerts a chaperone-like activity binding other proteins in blood and inhibiting their aggregation. Contrasting results are reported in the literature about the effects of albumin on α-syn aggregation. We characterized the binding region of HSA on α-syn by high-field solution NMR spectroscopy and the effect of HSA on α-syn aggregation by thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence under both low-ionic-strength and physiological conditions at the albumin concentration in serum and CSF. We found that HSA, at the concentration found in human serum, slows the aggregation of α-syn significantly. α-Syn interacts with HSA in an ionic strength- and pH-dependent manner. The binding is driven by hydrophobic interactions at the N-terminus under physiological experimental conditions and by electrostatic interactions at the C-terminus at low ionic strength.

RNA,2019 04 29,"Upon viral infection, a tug of war is triggered between host cells and viruses to maintain/gain control of vital cellular functions, the result of which will ultimately dictate the fate of the host cell. Among these essential cellular functions, alternative splicing (AS) is an important RNA maturation step that allows exons, or parts of exons, and introns to be retained in mature transcripts, thereby expanding proteome diversity and function. AS is widespread in higher eukaryotes, as it is estimated that nearly all genes in humans are alternatively spliced. Recent evidence has shown that upon infection by numerous viruses, the AS landscape of host-cells is affected. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of how virus infection impacts the AS of cellular transcripts. We also present various molecular mechanisms allowing viruses to modulate cellular AS.

RNA,2019 04 29,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA circles without a 5' cap or 3' tail. Since the landmark discovery of ciRS-7/CDR1as functioning as a miR-7 sponge in 2013, circRNAs have become a hot topic in RNA research. CircRNAs have been found to play active roles in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and many other diseases. They can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, protein scaffolds, and even translation templates. However, as circRNA research expands, many divergent views have emerged. For example, are most circRNAs competent in serving as miRNA sponges? What kinds of circRNAs are most likely to sponge miRNAs? Apart from sponging miRNAs, what could the functions of most circRNAs be? What are the features of circRNAs that are translatable? Many researchers have claimed that circRNAs are abundant, stable, conserved, and specific molecules, which hold great potential in serving as biomarkers. However, circRNA abundance is variable and some circRNAs are abundant while others are not. In addition, their stability and conservation may vary under different circumstances. Furthermore, it is unclear whether circRNA biogenesis is more likely to be regulated by RNA binding proteins or transcription factors. All of these are open questions that remain to be answered by researchers in this field. Discussing and investigating these questions will advance the understanding of this class of novel molecules and may propel inspiring new ideas for future studies.

Among the many factors which facilitate virus host adaptation, the polymerase subunit 2 (PB2) 627 plays an important role, although the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully understood. In a previous study, we found that histone H1.2 (encoded by HIST1H1C) regulates human or avian influenza virus replication in different ways, indicating that it might be involved in virus host adaption. Herein, we found that HIST1H1C expression, phosphorylation and methylation levels are decreased when infected with H1N1 influenza virus and increased when infected with H5N1 influenza virus. Overexpressing the eight gene segments of the influenza virus, we found that only PB2 significantly affects HIST1H1C expression and modifications. Since the 627 site is different between the H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses we constructed PB2-627E (avian variant) and PB2-627K (human variant) mutant viruses, and observed that the effects of the wild-type and the mutant viruses on HIST1H1C expression and modifications are opposite. Further analysis showed that influenza virus PB2-627 regulates HIST1H1C expression via Sp1, and specifically that PB2-627K down-regulates Sp1 and HIST1H1C while PB2-627E up-regulates Sp1 and HIST1H1C. In addition, HIST1H1C can feedback regulate DNA-PK and EHMT1/2, leading to altered HIST1H1C phosphorylation and methylation levels, and affecting influenza virus replication accordingly. In summary, this study illustrates the mechanism of PB2-627E/K-mediated regulation of influenza virus host adaption. This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, by regulating the interlayer structure of stacked titania sheets through weakened layer-to-layer interactions and a robustly pillared gallery space, the two-dimensional channel between neighboring sheets was completely open to guest intercalation, allowing fast intercalation that was practically irrespective of the carrier-ion sizes. Regardless of employing regular Li or large-radius Na and K ions, the material manifested zero strain-like behavior with no significant change in both host structure and interlayer space, enabling comparable capacities for all tested ions along with excellent rate behaviors and extraordinarily long lifetimes, even with 80-μm-thick electrodes. The result highlights the importance of interlayer structural features for unlocking the electrochemical activity of a layered material.",Potassium-induced decrease in cytosolic Na+ alleviates deleterious effects of salt stress on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034750,"Plant biology (Stuttgart, Germany)",2019 05 24,"Accumulation of NaCl in soil causes osmotic stress in plants, and sodium (Na+ ) and chloride (Cl- ) cause ion toxicity, but also reduce the potassium (K+ ) uptake by plant roots and stimulate the K+ efflux through the cell membrane. Thus, decreased K+ /Na+ ratio in plant tissue lead us to hypothesise that elevated levels of K+ in nutrient medium enhance this ratio in plant tissue and cytosol to improve enzyme activation, osmoregulation and charge balance. In this study, wheat was cultivated at different concentrations of K+ (2.2, 4.4 or 8.8 mm) with or without salinity (1, 60 or 120 mm NaCl) and the effects on growth, root and shoot Na+ and K+ distribution and grain yield were determined. Also, the cytosolic Na+ concentration was investigated, as well as photosynthesis rate and water potential. Salinity reduced fresh weight of both shoots and roots and dry weight of roots. The grain yield was significantly reduced under Na+ stress and improved with elevated K+ fertilisation. Elevated K+ level during cultivation prevented the accumulation of Na+ into the cytosol of both shoot and root protoplasts. Wheat growth at vegetative stage was transiently reduced at the highest K+ concentration, perhaps due to plants' efforts to overcome a high solute concentration in the plant tissue, nevertheless grain yield was increased at both K+ levels. In conclusion, a moderately elevated K+ application to wheat seedlings reduces tissue as well as cytosolic Na+ concentration and enhances wheat growth and grain yield by mitigating the deleterious effects of Na+ toxicity.",Tau tubulin kinases in proteinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034749,The FEBS journal,2019 05 25,"A number of neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau or TDP-43 in disease-affected neurons.

No disease-modifying therapeutics is available to treat these disorders, and we have a limited understanding of the cellular and molecular factors integral to disease initiation or progression. Phosphorylated tau and TDP-43 are important markers of pathology in dementia disorders and directly contribute to tau- and TDP-43-related neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.

However, the role of Np65 in regulation of emotional behavior is still unclear. In the present study, we show that Np65 knock-out (Np65 KO) mice display enhanced anxiety-like behavior, a reduction in some aspects of depressive-like behaviors, and increased sociability and memory. Biochemical investigations revealed that Np65 KO mice show increased adult-born neurons and proliferation in the hippocampus. In addition, the level of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the hippocampus was reduced. The expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 in the brainstem and the expression of the 5-HT3A receptor were also decreased. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed an impaired maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of Np65 KO mice. Together, our findings uncover a role for Np65 in regulating anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and suggest that Np65 may be essential for the maintenance of emotional stability, indicating that it might be an attractive potential target for treatment of psychiatric disorders.",Automated segmentation of medial temporal lobe subregions on in vivo T1-weighted MRI in early stages of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034738,Human brain mapping,2019 04 29,"Medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures are the earliest regions affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology-and thus are promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, automatic segmentation of the MTL using only T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging due to the large anatomical variability of the MTL cortex and the confound of the dura mater, which is commonly segmented as gray matter by state-of-the-art algorithms because they have similar intensity in T1w MRI. To address these challenges, we developed a novel atlas set, consisting of 15 cognitively normal older adults and 14 patients with mild cognitive impairment with a label explicitly assigned to the dura, that can be used by the multiatlas automated pipeline (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields [ASHS-T1]) for the segmentation of MTL subregions, including anterior/posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, and parahippocampal cortex on T1w MRI. Cross-validation experiments indicated good segmentation accuracy of ASHS-T1 and that the dura can be reliably separated from the cortex (6.5% mislabeled as gray matter). Conversely, FreeSurfer segmented majority of the dura mater (62.4%) as gray matter and the degree of dura mislabeling decreased with increasing disease severity. To evaluate its clinical utility, we applied the pipeline to T1w images of 663 ADNI subjects and significant volume/thickness loss is observed in BA35, ERC, and posterior hippocampus in early prodromal AD and all subregions at later stages. As such, the publicly available new atlas and ASHS-T1 could have important utility in the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD and enhancing brain-behavior studies of these regions.",Cardiovascular biomarkers in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034737,"Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care (San Antonio, Tex. : 2001)",2019 05 09,To measure plasma N-terminal fragments of pro-B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) concentration in hospitalized dogs and relate these markers to underlying conditions and evaluate their potential as prognostic markers in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).,Viscoelastic Conjugated Polymer Fluids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034736,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 31,"The introduction of optoelectronic functions into viscoelastic polymers can yield highly sophisticated soft materials for biomedical devices and autonomous robotics.

Therefore, we combined the expansion of hiPSCs in closed, perfusion-based 3D bioreactors with noninvasive online monitoring of oxygen as culture control mechanism. Bioreactors with a cell compartment volume of 3 or 17 ml were inoculated with either 10 × 106 or 50 × 106 cells, and cells were expanded over 15 days with online oxygen and offline glucose and lactate measurements being performed. The CellTiter-Blue® Assay was performed at the end of the bioreactor experiments for indirect cell quantification. Model simulations enabled an estimation of cell numbers based on kinetic equations and experimental data during the 15-day bioreactor cultures. Calculated oxygen uptake rates (OUR), glucose consumption rates (GCR), and lactate production rates (LPR) revealed a highly significant correlation (p < 0.0001). Oxygen consumption, which was measured at the beginning and the end of the experiment, showed a strong culture growth in line with the OUR and GCR data. Furthermore, the yield coefficient of lactate from glucose and the OUR to GCR ratio revealed a shift from nonoxidative to oxidative metabolism. The presented results indicate that oxygen is equally as applicable as parameter for hiPSC expansion as glucose while providing an accurate real-time impression of hiPSC culture development. Additionally, oxygen measurements inform about the metabolic state of the cells. Thus, the use of oxygen online monitoring for culture control facilitates the translation of hiPSC use to the clinical setting.",Maternal and early-life area-level characteristics and childhood adiposity: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034734,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2019 04 29,"There is a cross-sectional evidence that physical and social environments are linked to childhood adiposity. Evidence is scarce for the role of preconception, pregnancy, and early-life area-level characteristics in shaping childhood adiposity. We aimed to systematically review evidence for associations between physical and social environmental conditions experienced in these periods and childhood adiposity. Published literature was identified from the CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases. Longitudinal studies linking an area-level environmental exposure in the preconception, pregnancy, or early-life (less than 1 year) periods and a measure of adiposity between the ages of 2 and 12 years were examined. Eight studies in the United States, Denmark, South Korea, United Kingdom, and Canada satisfied the inclusion criteria. Storm-induced maternal stress, nitrogen oxides exposure, traffic noise, and proximity were associated with greater childhood adiposity. Frequent neighbourhood disturbances were associated with lower adiposity, while particulate matter exposure was associated with both higher and lower adiposity in childhood. Area-level characteristics may play a role in the ongoing obesity epidemic. There is a limited evidence of longitudinal associations between preconception, pregnancy, and early-life area-level characteristics with childhood adiposity. Numerous factors that appear important in cross-sectional research have yet to be assessed longitudinally, both individually and in combination."

Also implicated in the dam physiology is oxytocin, a neurohormone released from the posterior pituitary that is necessary for milk ejection. Because the projection fields from oxytocin-immunoreactive (-IR) neurones and the mediobasal preoptic hypothalamus overlap and MCH-IR neurones are found in proximity to oxytocin neurones, we investigated the spatial relationship between MCH and oxytocin fibres. Accordingly, we employed multiple immunohistochemistry labelling for MCH and oxytocin for light and electron microscopy techniques, in addition to i.v. tracer injection combined with in situ hybridisation to identify MCH neurones that project to neurosecretory areas. As described for other strains, lactating Long-Evans dams also display immunoreactivity for MCH in the preoptic hypothalamus on days 12 and 19 of lactation. The appearance of these neurones is contemporaneous with an increase in MCH-IR fibres in both the internal layer of the median eminence and the posterior pituitary. In both regions, MCH- and oxytocin-IR fibres were found in great proximity, although there was no evidence for synaptic interaction between these two populations at the ultrastructural level. The tracer injection revealed that only mediobasal preoptic MCH neurones project to the posterior pituitary, suggesting a neuroendocrine-modulatory role for this population. When taken together, the results obtained in the present study indicate that neuroplasticity events at the mediobasal preoptic hypothalamus that occur during late lactation may be part of a neuroendocrinology control loop involving both MCH and oxytocin.","Pear Extract and Malaxinic Acid Reverse Obesity, Adipose Tissue Inflammation, and Hepatosteatosis in Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034714,Molecular nutrition & food research,2019 05 10,"Obesity and diabetes are major public health problems and are emerging as pandemics.

Arabidopsis thaliana cTPI (AtcTPI) is subject of redox regulation at two reactive cysteines that function as thiol switches. Here we investigate the role of these residues, AtcTPI-Cys13 and At-Cys218, by substituting them with aspartic acid that mimics the irreversible oxidation of cysteine to sulfinic acid and with amino acids that mimic thiol conjugation. Crystallographic studies show that mimicking AtcTPI-Cys13 oxidation promotes the formation of inactive monomers by reposition residue Phe75 of the neighboring subunit, into a conformation that destabilizes the dimer interface. Mutations in residue AtcTPI-Cys218 to Asp, Lys, or Tyr generate TPI variants with a decreased enzymatic activity by creating structural modifications in two loops (loop 7 and loop 6) whose integrity is necessary to assemble the active site. In contrast with mutations in residue AtcTPI-Cys13, mutations in AtcTPI-Cys218 do not alter the dimeric nature of AtcTPI. Therefore, modifications of residues AtcTPI-Cys13 and AtcTPI-Cys218 modulate AtcTPI activity by inducing the formation of inactive monomers and by altering the active site of the dimeric enzyme, respectively. The identity of residue AtcTPI-Cys218 is conserved in the majority of plant cytosolic TPIs, this conservation and its solvent-exposed localization make it the most probable target for TPI regulation upon oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species. Our data reveal the structural mechanisms by which S-glutathionylation protects AtcTPI from irreversible chemical modifications and re-routes carbon metabolism to the pentose phosphate pathway to decrease oxidative stress.",Interaction of coronavirus nucleocapsid protein with the 5'- and 3'-ends of the coronavirus genome is involved in genome circularization and negative-strand RNA synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034708,The FEBS journal,2019 05 13,"Synthesis of the negative-strand ((-)-strand) counterpart is the first step of coronavirus (CoV) replication; however, the detailed mechanism of the early event and the factors involved remain to be determined. Here, using bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-defective interfering (DI) RNA, we showed that (a) a poly(A) tail with a length of 15 nucleotides (nt) was sufficient to initiate efficient (-)-strand RNA synthesis and (b) substitution of the poly(A) tail with poly(U), (C) or (G) only slightly decreased the efficiency of (-)-strand synthesis. The findings indicate that in addition to the poly(A) tail, other factors acting in trans may also participate in (-)-strand synthesis. The BCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein, an RNA-binding protein, was therefore tested as a candidate. Based on dissociation constant (Kd ) values, it was found that the binding affinity between N protein, but not poly(A)-binding protein, and the 3'-terminal 55 nt plus a poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail correlates with the efficiency of (-)-strand synthesis. Such an association was also evidenced by the binding affinity between the N protein and 5'- and 3'-terminal cis-acting elements important for (-)-strand synthesis. Further analysis demonstrated that N protein can act as a bridge to facilitate interaction between the 5'- and 3'-ends of the CoV genome, leading to circularization of the genome. Together, the current study extends our understanding of the mechanism of CoV (-)-strand RNA synthesis through involvement of N protein and genome circularization and thus may explain why the addition of N protein in trans is required for efficient CoV replication.",Intra-operative temperature monitoring with cutaneous zero-heat- flux-thermometry in comparison with oesophageal temperature: A prospective study in the paediatric population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034706,Paediatric anaesthesia,2019 05 27,Maintenance of thermal homeostasis is of crucial importance in the anesthetized pediatric patient.

This growth arrest requires accumulation of the transcription factor STOP1 in the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of the malate transporter gene ALMT1; exuded malate is suspected to interact with extracellular Fe to inhibit root growth. In addition, ALS3 - an ABC-like transporter identified for its role in tolerance to toxic Al - represses nuclear accumulation of STOP1 and the expression of ALMT1. Until now it was unclear whether Pi deficiency itself or Fe activates the accumulation of STOP1 in the nucleus. Here, by using different growth media to dissociate the effects of Fe from Pi deficiency itself, we demonstrate that Fe is sufficient to trigger the accumulation of STOP1 in the nucleus, which, in turn, activates the expression of ALMT1. We also show that a low pH is necessary to stimulate the Fe-dependent accumulation of nuclear STOP1. Furthermore, pharmacological experiments indicate that Fe inhibits proteasomal degradation of STOP1. We also show that Al acts like Fe for nuclear accumulation of STOP1 and ALMT1 expression, and that the overaccumulation of STOP1 in the nucleus of the als3 mutant grown in low-Pi conditions could be abolished by Fe deficiency. Altogether, our results indicate that, under low-Pi conditions, Fe2/3+ and Al3+ act similarly to increase the stability of STOP1 and its accumulation in the nucleus where it activates the expression of ALMT1.",False-positive Candida and Aspergillus antigen testing in recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation due to administration of parenteral nutrition and fixed combinations of piperacillin-tazobactam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034703,Mycoses,2019 06 13,"False positivity of antigen immunoassays used as an early diagnostic tool to detect invasive fungal infections is known.

Measurable amounts of Candida antigen mannan were detected in several compounds of PN and TZP in a previous in vitro study. In the current study, 84 patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation receiving either TZP, PN or both were monitored with Aspergillus and Candida antigen assay. Six patients were analysed closer in a kinetic analysis with more frequent blood sampling to detect mannan. PN in diverse compositions as well as TZP did not increase significantly the amount of mannan and the Aspergillus antigen in serum. We could not confirm the positive results of the in vitro study.

There is a need for reliable and valid instruments measuring personal recovery. Therefore, the current study evaluated the psychometric properties of a Dutch translation of the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR) in a sample of people with BD and explored the relationship with constructs of well-being, social role participation and psychopathology. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted, in which 102 people diagnosed with BD completed the QPR. Factor structure of the QPR was evaluated by conducting confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and internal consistency was assessed by calculating reliability coefficients. Convergent validation measures assessed well-being, social role participation and symptomatology. Incremental validity was determined by evaluating the ability of the QPR to explain variance in symptomatology above and beyond measures of well-being and social role participation. Findings of the CFA supported a unidimensional factor structure and internal consistency estimates were excellent. Scores of the QPR showed strong correlations with convergent measures, but were only weakly associated with manic symptomatology. Moreover, personal recovery explained additional variance in symptoms of depression and anxiety above and beyond well-being, indicating incremental validity. The QPR appears to be a reliable and valid tool to assess personal recovery in people with BD. Our findings underline the importance of personal recovery in the context of treatment of BD.

VDR is highly expressed in the intestine, kidney, bone, and macrophages, but is expressed at a low level in the liver. The liver is a major metabolic organ and also acts as an immune gateway for dietary nutrients and xenobiotics. In this study, we investigated the function of VDR in hepatic immune cells, such as Kupffer cells/macrophages, utilizing VDR knockout (KO) mice. We showed that VDR is functionally expressed in hepatic mononuclear cells, specifically resident Kupffer cells. We examined the role of VDR in acute hepatitis induced by concanavalin A (Con-A) and found that Con-A-induced hepatitis is attenuated in VDR-KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Con-A-induced hepatitis is known to be mediated by NKT cell activation, cytokine production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Kupffer cells/macrophages. However, the proportions of Kupffer cells/macrophages and the NKT cell activation were similar in the liver of WT and VDR-KO mice and inflammatory cytokine gene expression was increased in VDR-KO mice. On the other hand, plasma and hepatic ROS levels were decreased in the liver of VDR-KO mice compared to WT mice. The phagocytic activity of resident Kupffer cells and hepatic neutrophils were also decreased in VDR-KO mice. Therefore, VDR is necessary for Con-A-induced acute hepatitis and plays an important role in hepatic immune cell functions.",Transverse relaxation-based assessment of mammographic density and breast tissue composition by single-sided portable NMR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034648,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 06 11,"Elevated mammographic density (MD) is an independent risk factor for breast cancer (BC) as well as a source of masking in X-ray mammography.

We therefore prospectively evaluated 37 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who underwent kidney biopsy due to slight increases in serum creatinine, or mild proteinuria (>0.3 g/24 hr), in the first post-transplant year. Banff score, CD68+ count (score 0-3) by immunohistochemistry, and 1-year DSA were assessed. DGF was reported in 10 (27%) patients, 6 (16%) had normal biopsy, 7 (19%) borderline lesions, 13 (35%) IFTA, and 11 (30%) other lesions. Fifteen KTRs had grade 3 CD68+ infiltration, and 47% developed de novo DSA. During a 6.2 ± 2.7 year follow-up, four patients (11%) suffered from biopsy-proven T-cell rejection, 17 KTRs (46%) lost their graft (12 in the grade 3 CD68+ group). Graft survival was lower in KTRs with grade 3 CD68+ infiltration (P = 0.0074; log-rank test). Grade 3 CD68+ infiltrate was an independent predictor of graft loss (HR 5.41, 95% CI 1.74-16.8; P = 0.003), together with more severe graft dysfunction at biopsy (HR 6.41, 95% CI 2.57-16; P < 0.001).

In recent years, the therapeutic effect of OC has been significantly improved through the application of effective chemotherapy regimen. However, the 5-year survival rate is also lower than 30% due to high rate of relapse. So, it is needed to screen reliable predictive and prognostic markers of OC. Ovarian cancer gene expression data and corresponding clinical data used were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Weighted gene expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Cox proportional hazards regression (PHR) were used to screen Pathological Grade and Prognosis-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves analysis were performed to evaluate the predictive ability of the selected lncRNA. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment analysis methods were used to explore the possible mechanisms of the selected lncRNA affecting the development of OC. Five reliably lncRNAs (LINC00664, LINC00667, LINC01139, LINC01419, and LOC286437) was identified through a series of bioinformatics methods. In testing cohorts, we found that the five lncRNAs in predicting the risk of OC recurrence is robustness, and multivariate Cox PHR analysis indicate that the five lncRNAs is an independent risk factor for OC recurrence. Moreover, GO and GSEA enrichment analysis showed that the five lncRNAs are involved in multiple ovarian cancer occurrence mechanism. In summary, all these findings indicated that the five lncRNAs can effectively predict the risk of recurrence of ovarian cancer.",Perioperative morbidity and mortality in dogs with invasive adrenal neoplasms treated by adrenalectomy and cavotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034643,Veterinary surgery : VS,2019 04 29,To report the morbidity and mortality associated with adrenalectomy with cavotomy for resection of invasive adrenal neoplasms in dogs and evaluate risk factors for perioperative outcomes.,Patients' perceptions of a culturally targeted Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program: A mixed methods study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034642,Clinical transplantation,2019 06 10,"Disproportionately fewer waitlisted Hispanics receive living donor kidney transplants (LDKTs) compared to non-Hispanic whites.

Qualitative thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were performed. Thirty-six individuals participated (62% participation rate) comprising 21 potential recipients and 15 potential donors/family (mean age: 51 years, 50% female, 72% preferred Spanish). Participants felt confident about the educational information because a transplant physician delivered the education and viewed the group format as effective. Participants felt that education sessions addressed myths about transplantation shared by Hispanics. Primary use of Spanish enhanced participants' understanding of transplantation. While few knew about living donation before attending the HKTP, most were ""more in favor of"" kidney transplantation (97%) and living donation (97%) afterward. Few reported learning about the HKTP from outreach staff and suggested leveraging community leaders to promote HKTP awareness. Our findings suggest the HKTP's cultural components were viewed favorably and positively influenced perceptions of kidney transplantation and living donation, which may help reduce transplant disparities in Hispanics.

Detailed tests were conducted on model aromatic molecules including benzene, pyrrole, indole, isoindole, and carbazole and subsequently applied to H2 Pc, ZnPc, Al(OH)Pc, and CuPc. Similar behavior of three selected magnetic probes, Bq, 3 He, and 7 Li+ , approaching perpendicularly the ring centers, was observed. For better visualization of shielding zone over the centers of aromatic rings, we introduced a simple mathematical procedure: the first and second derivatives of scan curves with respect to magnetic probe position enabled their additional examination. It allowed an easier localization of curve minimum and discrimination between areas in space varying by the magnetic field magnitude and to illustrate local aromaticity of two different kinds of rings in MPc with better resolution. Our results supported earlier reports on very low aromaticity indexes of pyrrole ring incorporated into MPc and significant aromaticity of the central macrocycle. No direct dependence between harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity and NICS was observed. Instead, a correlation between position of scan curve minimum and its magnitude were observed. In addition, the NICS values and 3 He chemical shifts in the middle of neutral C60 and C606- anion agreed well with the reported experimental NMR values for He@C60 and He@C606- .","Deuterated Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: A Science Based Proposal for Synthesis, Analysis, and Control.

Sufficient toxicity data are available for a reevaluation of previously developed dispersant-Interspecies Correlation Estimation (ICE) models. These models increase species diversity as toxicity predictions for untested species are made from the known toxicity for surrogates. Data were used to refine 4 and develop 25 new dispersant-ICE models. Most of the new models are for species not included in >2,000 existing ICE models, and contain a higher species diversity than the original dispersant-ICE models (19 versus 7 species). Dispersant-ICE models predict toxicity with reasonably accuracy: predictions were within a 3-fold of observed values (new models: 70% of 132 predictions; refined models: 88% of 83 predictions), and species sensitivity distributions developed with ICE-predicted data only were in most cases not statistically significantly different from those developed with empirical data (83% of 23 paired-comparisons). Examples of the practical application of dispersant-ICE models, including laboratory-to-field comparisons within the context of operational dispersant application rates are also presented. The significance of this work is that dispersant-ICE models could fill gaps in species diversity, and thus help address concerns about species sensitivities related to the use of dispersants.

These direct interactions serve as molecular initiating events (MIEs) that impede ATP production and other critical functions that mitochondria serve within the cell (e.g., calcium and metal homeostasis, apoptosis, immune signaling, redox balance). A limited but growing number of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) have been proposed to associate mitochondrial dysfunction with effects at organismal and population levels. These pathways involve key events (KEs), such as altered membrane potential, mitochondrial fission/fusion, and mtDNA damage, among others. This critical review and analysis reveal current progress on AOPs involving mitochondrial dysfunction and identifies, using a network-based computational approach, the localization of mitochondrial MIEs and KEs within multiple existing AOPs. We also present two case studies: one examining the interaction between mitochondria and immunotoxicity, and a second case study examining the role of early mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of behavior (i.e., locomotor activity). We discuss limitations in current mitochondrial AOPs and highlight opportunities for improving their clarity and detail. Advancing our knowledge regarding KE relationships within the AOP framework will require high-throughput datasets that permit the development and testing of chemical-agnostic AOPs, and high-resolution research that will enhance mechanistic testing and validation of these KE relationships. Given the wide range of chemicals that affect mitochondria, and the centrality of energy production and signaling to ecologically important outcomes such as pathogen defense, homeostasis, growth, and reproduction, mitochondrial AOPs are expected to play a significant, if not central, role in environmental toxicology.

First, solubility study and pseudo-ternary phase diagram analysis were adopted to optimize the formulation of liquid self-emulsifying delivery system (L-SEDS). And the thermodynamic stable L-SEDS with 5% content of DMY was fabricated and further developed into a solid form via vacuum rotary evaporation with Aerosil 300 as the solid adsorbent. Solid state characterization of the S-SEDS was performed by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. Furthermore, studies proved that the antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility of DMY were improved after incorporated into S-SEDS formulation compared to pure DMY. The S-SEDS showed good resistance against various storage conditions investigated for 10 weeks. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Solid self-emulsifying delivery system (S-SEDS) combined the advantages of liquid self-emulsifying delivery system with those of a solid dosage form to overcome the disadvantages associated with liquid formulations is more convenient for storage and transportation in practical application. Furthermore, the technology of producing S-SEDS is simple and can be realized in industrial production.

Research has demonstrated that fathers matter to children's development. Despite noted progress, challenges remain on how best to conceptualize and assess fathering and father-child relationships. The current monograph is the result of an SRCD-sponsored meeting of fatherhood scholars brought together to discuss these challenges and make recommendations for best practices for incorporating fathers in studies on parenting and children's development. The first aim of this monograph was to provide a brief update on the current state of research on fathering and to lay out a developmental ecological systems perspective as a conceptual framework for understanding the different spaces fathers inhabit in their children's lives. Because there is wide variability in fathers' roles, the ecological systems perspective situates fathers, mothers, children, and other caregivers within an evolving network of interrelated social relationships in which children and their parents change over time and space (e.g., residence). The second aim was to present examples of empirical studies conducted by members of the international working group that highlighted different methods, data collection, and statistical analyses used to capture the variability in father-child relationships. The monograph ends with a commentary that elaborates on the ecological systems framework with a discussion of the broader macrosystem and social-contextual influences that impinge on fathers and their children.

Twenty-nine RCTs were identified, and they encompassed 82 treatment effects among 2305 patients/survivors. Psychosocial interventions were associated with significant improvements in meaning/purpose (g = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.52; P < .0001). Interventions designed to enhance meaning/purpose (g = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.60) demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes than those targeting other primary outcomes (g = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27; P = .009). Few other intervention, clinical, or demographic characteristics tested were significant moderators. In conclusion, the results suggest that psychosocial interventions are associated with small to medium effects in enhancing meaning/purpose among patients with cancer, and the benefits are comparable to those of interventions designed to reduce depression, pain, and fatigue in patients with cancer. Methodological concerns include small samples and ambiguity regarding allocation concealment. Future research should focus on explicitly meaning-centered interventions and identify optimal treatment or survivorship phases for implementation.",A phase 1 and randomized controlled phase 2 trial of the safety and efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel with ontuxizumab (MORAb-004) in metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034598,Cancer,2019 04 29,"Ontuxizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, targets endosialin (tumor endothelial marker 1 [TEM-1] or CD248), which is expressed on sarcoma cells and is believed to be involved in tumor angiogenesis.

Many newly developed medications have novel mechanisms of action and include targeted therapies and immunotherapy options. These agents typically have unique side effects that differ from more traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Older adults represent the majority of patients with cancer and it is important for geriatricians and primary care providers for older adults to have a general understanding of newer agents and novel therapies, in order to aid in decision-making and supportive care strategies during oncology treatment. This review provides a case-based approach to discussing emerging therapeutic treatment options, including targeted therapies and immune-based therapies, in two common malignancies affecting older adults.

A semantic review of English-language publications was performed by searching for MeSH terms and keywords in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The studies were finally selected by one author according to the aim of this review. ICG is a highly water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye that fluoresces in the NIR spectrum. Approved by the FDA in 1959, it can be administered either IV (usual dose of 5 mg) or locally/submucosally (usual dose of 5-6.25 mg) according to the pathology or indication. It is used most often in the setting of oncology, endometriosis and other gynecological conditions. In oncological applications, ICG is used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) using near-infrared light in endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers. The main advantages that it offers include a reduction of surgical time, improved SLN detection rates, and the ability to avoid radioactivity. In cases of endometrial (submucosal or hysteroscopic applications) or cervical (intracervical administration) cancer, ICG can detect SLN at an accuracy of 95% to 98%. For vulvar cancer, the SLN detection rate can reach 100%. In endometriosis, the lack of good evidence hinders the final evaluation of this method in both diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios. An analytical, well-designed, prospective study is currently underway.",Mechatronic Support System for NOTES and Monoport Surgery - A New Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034576,Surgical technology international,2019 05 16,"To circumvent the drawbacks of currently available platforms for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and monoport surgery (MPS), we developed a patient-specific, disposable, surgical soft robotic system.

The platform body and the manipulators can be quickly adapted to transmural (monoport), NOTES and endoluminal (endoscopic) applications, and 3D-printed overnight as an individualized system. In addition, practical considerations, such as the predicted ""ideal"" dimensions of the platform, were evaluated. As a result, we found that preoperatively available biometric data currently provide little support for tailored instrument design.

Usually surgical incisions are closed by fixing the edges together. However, in case of significant tissue loss, infected surgical field, or particular cases, wounds may be left open. In recent years, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been widely used for management of various complicated wounds and to support postoperative tissue healing. Another emerging indication for NPWT, applied directly to the closed incisions, is to prevent infections or dehiscences in patients with increased risk of surgical-site complications (iNPWT). Furthermore, the combination of negative pressure with intermittent instillation of solution (NPWTi) seems to be effective in the treatment of a variety of complex wounds. Even if the role of NPWT in promoting wound healing has been largely accepted, there is a lack of evidence (few high-level clinical studies) regarding its effectiveness and further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of action. This article contains a review of recent scientific and clinical research related to indications, contraindications, and mechanisms of action of NPWT to clarify current knowledge, technological evolutions, and future perspectives of devices.",Role of Cuticular Hydrocarbons in German Cockroach (Blattodea: Ectobiidae) Aggregation Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034573,Environmental entomology,2019 06 07,"Aggregation can be adaptive by providing protection from predators, facilitating thermoregulation, and expediting the location of food, shelter, and mates. German cockroaches Blattella germanica L. (Blattodea: Ectobiidae), are obligatory commensals in human-built structures, where they aggregate in crevices during the day. The source of the aggregation pheromone that drives this behavior and its chemical identity remain unclear. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in feces have been proposed to serve as aggregation pheromone, but this function has not been investigated in relation to visual and tactile cues that mediate aggregation. Our objective was to delineate how CHCs in the feces and on the cockroach body operate in conditions that reflect the German cockroach's ecology-either applied to shelters, representing fecal deposition, or to previously extracted cockroaches, representing shelter co-habitation with other cockroaches. Cockroaches and feces-conditioned filter papers were extracted, CHCs were purified by flash chromatography, and two-choice behavior assays were performed with first instar nymphs. Our results confirmed that nymphs preferred to rest within feces-conditioned shelters. However, purified CHCs did not elicit more aggregation than solvent-treated control shelters. Nymphs significantly preferred to rest in shelters that contained a CHC-free dead female, but the addition of CHCs to the female did not enhance aggregation. Nymphs preferred to aggregate with the CHC-free female over CHC-treated shelters. Finally, a methanol extract of feces was highly effective at eliciting aggregation, contesting previous reports that fecal CHCs serve as aggregation pheromone. We assert that CHCs play a minor, if any, role in the aggregation behavior of German cockroaches.",Organ-preserving approach via radiotherapy for small cell carcinoma of the bladder: an analysis based on the Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group (JROSG) survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034572,Journal of radiation research,2019 04 29,"Small cell carcinoma of the bladder is extremely rare, accounting for <1% of all malignant tumours in the urinary tract. Thus, no standard therapy modality for this malignancy has been established. This study aimed to retrospectively analyse the clinical outcomes associated with definitive radiotherapy for small cell carcinoma of the bladder. A questionnaire-based survey of patients with pathologically proven small cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with definitive radiation therapy between 1990 and 2010 was conducted by the Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group. The clinical records of 12 eligible patients were collected from nine institutions. The median age of the patients was 70.5 years (range: 44-87 years), and the median follow-up period was 27.3 months (range: 3.3-117.8 months). The median prescribed dose was 60 Gy (range: 50.0-61.0 Gy), and a median of 2.0 Gy (range: 1.2-2.0 Gy) was administered per fraction. Systemic chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy was performed in eight cases (66.7%). The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 50.0% and 33.3%, respectively. And the 3- and 5-year local control rates were 66.7% and 55.6%, respectively. Chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival and relapse-free survival (P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). No serious adverse events occurred in the observation period. All patients who achieved local control maintained functional bladders. In conclusion, radiotherapy is a potential local treatment option and has an important role in maintaining quality of life. Systemic chemotherapy combined with local radiotherapy seems to be effective in improving survival.","Impact of radiotherapy on immunological parameters, levels of inflammatory factors, and clinical prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034571,Journal of radiation research,2019 06 10,"The aim of this study was to observe dynamic changes in immunological parameters and levels of inflammatory factors from pre-radiotherapy to post-radiotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer, and to evaluate the related clinical prognosis. In all, 110 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent radiotherapy were enrolled. Before radiotherapy, post-radiotherapy, and 3 months after radiotherapy, the percentages of T lymphocyte subsets and natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood were detected using flow cytometry. The levels of serum inflammatory factors were measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thirty peripheral blood samples from healthy people were similarly analysed as the control. Before radiotherapy, the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and the CD4+/CD8+ rate in esophageal cancer patients were significantly different from those in the healthy control group (P < 0.001); the levels of inflammatory factors were increased significantly (P < 0.001). The percentages of the above cells and the levels of inflammatory factors also differed statistically significantly between pre- and post-radiotherapy (P < 0.001) in the esophageal cancer patients. Three months after radiotherapy, the percentages of CD3+ (P = 0.453), CD4+ (P = 0.108), and CD8+ T cells (P = 0.163) and NK cells (P = 0.103) had recovered to the level before radiotherapy; and the levels of TNF-α (P = 0.101), IL-6 (P = 0.302) and IL-8 (P = 0.250) were also restored. After radiotherapy, alterations in immunological parameters were associated with the irradiation volume and the myelosuppression condition. Patients with recovered immunological parameters showed a longer median survival time than those with poor recovery of immunological parameters. For esophageal cancer patients who were immunosuppressive and had an activated inflammatory response before radiotherapy, radiotherapy aggravated these symptoms, and this aggravation was positively associated with myelosuppression and irradiation volume. In addition, recovery of the immunological parameters indicated better prognosis.",Hyaluronate gel injection for rectum dose reduction in gynecologic high-dose-rate brachytherapy: initial Japanese experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034570,Journal of radiation research,2019 04 29,"Perirectal hyaluronate gel injection (HGI) appears to be a promising technique for healthy tissue dose sparing in pelvic radiotherapy. In this analysis, we report our initial experience of HGI in gynecologic brachytherapy, focusing on its safety and effectiveness for dose reduction to the rectum. Between July 2013 and May 2014, 36 patients received HGI for primary/salvage gynecologic brachytherapy. Dosimetric effect analysis was based on pre- and post-HGI computed tomography dataset registration with corresponding dose-volume histogram evaluation. The maximum dose to the most exposed 0.1 cm3 (D0.1cm3) and 2.0 cm3 (D2.0cm3) were used as index values for rectum and bladder dose evaluation. The dose indexes for target volume (TV) coverage were TV D90/V100. In all cases, HGI was well tolerated, with no acute or late adverse events documented at a median follow-up of 220 days (range, 18-1046 days). Rectum D2.0cm3 and D0.1cm3 were significantly decreased by HGI (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively), with no significant impact on dosimetric parameters of bladder and TV coverage. Factors correlating negatively with the dosimetric effect of HGI were an increasing number of interstitial catheters (P = 0.003) as well as Lcranial100% (P = 0.014) and Lcranial80% (P = 0.001) [i.e. the length from the anal verge to the most cranial point at which the 100% and 80% isodose lines, respectively, crossed the rectum]. The concept of HGI for gynecologic brachytherapy is plausible, and our initial experience indicates it to be an effective technique for rectal dose reduction in radiotherapy of intrapelvic tumours.",The Laminin Interactome: A Multifactorial Laminin-Binding Strategy by Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae for Effective Adherence and Colonization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034569,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 04 29,"Laminin is a well-defined component of the airway basement membrane (BM). Efficient binding of laminin via multiple interactions is important for nontypeable Haemophilusinfluenzae (NTHi) colonization in the airway mucosa. Here we identified elongation factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu), L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Protein D and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein P6 as novel laminin-binding proteins (Lbps) of NTHi. In parallel with other well-studied Lbps (P4, PE, PF and Hap), EF-Tu, LDH, PD and P6 exhibited interactions with laminin, and mediated NTHi laminin-dependent adherence to pulmonary epithelial cell lines. Importantly, the NTHi laminin interactome consisting of the well-studied and novel Lbps recognized laminin LG domains from the subunit α chains of laminin-111 and -332, of which the latter isoform is the main laminin in the airway BM. The NTHi interactome mainly targeted multiple heparin-binding domains of laminin. In conclusion, the NTHi interactome exhibited a high plasticity of interactions with different laminin isoforms via multiple heparin-binding sites.",A Case Study of Cimex lectularius L. (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) Infestations in an Office Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034568,Journal of economic entomology,2019 04 29,"Most field studies on Cimex lectularius are conducted in residential or hospitality industrial settings. Cimex lectularius infestations in office settings are reported, but are rarely studied. An office environment (~875 m2) consisting of 105 cubicles or pod-seating areas with persistent C. lectularius sightings over a 2-yr period was evaluated for 90 d through intensive trapping to determine C. lectularius distribution and to eliminate the infestation. The study area was partially occupied during the study period. Two treatments of amorphous silica dust (112.5 g dust in total) were applied 29 and 57 d after the first day of monitoring. A total of 32 C. lectularius were captured by interceptors over a period of 55 d. Dry ice traps captured eight additional C. lectularius. Visual inspections identified one chair with live C. lectularius and eggs. The infestation was eliminated on 69 d after initial installation of interceptors. Spatial analysis using Ripley's K and L functions showed a high level of aggregation up to a 15 meter scale. Dispersal of C. lectularius in office settings was limited. Intensive trapping plus limited insecticide dust treatments effectively detected and eliminated C. lectularius."
