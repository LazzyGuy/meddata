Here, we investigated whether kallikrein-related peptidase 8 (KLK8)-neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ErbB signaling is crucial for social discrimination behavior using the social discrimination three chamber behavioral test. Klk8 knockout mice (NRG1-deactivated mice) exhibited normal social approach but impaired social discrimination. Intraventricular injection of recombinant NRG1177-246 into Klk8 knockout mice reversed this impaired social discrimination.

We report on the case, as documented using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), of the triple MF that were identified on the right hemimandible of a 28-year-old female patient. The distal foramen was located on the mandible between the apices of the second premolar root and the first molar mesiovestibular root, being reached by a thin canal that left the mandibular canal. A pair of mesial foramina were identified between the apices of the premolar teeth. Thus, the three foramina corresponded to a surface area of 23.49mm2 of the mandible. On the opposite side, a single mental foramen had a surface area of just 13.25mm2. On each side, retromolar canals that opened into the retromolar fossae were also found. The anatomic possibility of multiple MF increases the surface area at risk during surgical procedures, increases the risk of neurovascular damage and obscures the common tooth-related location of the mental foramen. Practitioners should, therefore, consider a personalised and imaging-documented approach so as to avoid treatment failure.",Reconciling environment-mediated metabolic heterogeneity with the oncogene-driven cancer paradigm in precision oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103464,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,2019 05 25,"Precision oncology is the practice of matching one therapy to one specific patient, based on particular genetic tumor alterations, in order to achieve the best clinical response. Despite an expanding arsenal of targeted therapies, many patients still have a poor outcome because tumor cells show a remarkable capacity to develop drug resistance, thereby leading to tumor relapse. Besides genotype-driven resistance mechanisms, tumor microenvironment (TME) peculiarities strongly contribute to generate an intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity that affects disease progression and treatment outcome. In this Review, we describe how TME-mediated metabolic heterogeneities actively participate to therapeutic failure. We report how a lactate-based metabolic symbiosis acts as a mechanism of adaptive resistance to targeted therapies and we describe the role of mitochondrial metabolism, in particular oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to support the growth and survival of therapy-resistant tumor cells in a variety of cancers. Finally, we detail potential metabolism-interfering therapeutic strategies aiming to eradicate OXPHOS-dependent relapse-sustaining malignant cells and we discuss relevant (pre)clinical models that may help integrate TME-driven metabolic heterogeneity in precision oncology.",Xanthine oxidase-mediated oxidative stress promotes cancer cell-specific apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103463,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 06 16,"The natural compound Alternol was shown to induce profound oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death preferentially in cancer cells. In this study, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to understand the mechanism for Alternol-induced ROS accumulation responsible for apoptotic cell death. Our data revealed that Alternol treatment moderately increased mitochondrial superoxide formation rate, but it was significantly lower than the total ROS positive cell population. Pre-treatment with mitochondria-specific anti-oxidant MitoQ, NOX or NOS specific inhibitors had no protective effect on Alternol-induced ROS accumulation and cell death. However, XDH/XO inhibition by specific small chemical inhibitors or gene silencing reduced total ROS levels and protected cells from apoptosis induced by Alternol. Further analysis revealed that Alternol treatment significantly enhanced XDH oxidative activity and induced a strong protein oxidation-related damage in malignant but not benign cells. Interestingly, benign cells exerted a strong spike in anti-oxidant SOD and catalase activities compared to malignant cells after Alternol treatment. Cell-based protein-ligand engagement and in-silicon docking analysis showed that Alternol interacts with XDH protein on the catalytic domain with two amino acid residues away from its substrate binding sites. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Alternol treatment enhances XDH oxidative activity, leading to ROS-dependent apoptotic cell death.",2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS focused update to 2015 expert consensus statement on optimal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming and testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103461,Heart rhythm,2019 05 19,"The 2015 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/SOLAECE Expert Consensus Statement on Optimal Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Programming and Testing provided guidance on bradycardia programming, tachycardia detection, tachycardia therapy, and defibrillation testing for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patient treatment. The 32 recommendations represented the consensus opinion of the writing group, graded by Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence. In addition, Appendix B provided manufacturer-specific translations of these recommendations into clinical practice consistent with the recommendations within the parent document. In some instances, programming guided by quality evidence gained from studies performed in devices from some manufacturers was translated such that this programming was approximated in another manufacturer's ICD programming settings. The authors found that the data, although not formally tested, were strong, consistent, and generalizable beyond the specific manufacturer and model of ICD. As expected, because these recommendations represented strategic choices to balance risks, there have been reports in which adverse outcomes were documented with ICDs programmed to Appendix B recommendations. The recommendations have been reviewed and updated to minimize such adverse events. Notably, patients who do not receive unnecessary ICD therapy are not aware of being spared potential harm, whereas patients in whom their ICD failed to treat life-threatening arrhythmias have their event recorded in detail. The revised recommendations employ the principle that the randomized trials and large registry data should guide programming more than anecdotal evidence. These recommendations should not replace the opinion of the treating physician who has considered the patient's clinical status and desired outcome via a shared clinical decision-making process.",Rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing by resazurin using thin film platinum as a bio-electrode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103460,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 06 07,"Traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing methods take several days to confirm and start disease treatment. The lack of new antibiotics or drugs warrants a need for optimization of current diagnostic tools for immediate antibiotic susceptibility testing. We present a rapid screening method to evaluate the response of bacteria to antibiotics based upon the electrochemical measurement of live bacterial cell metabolic activity using an electroactive redox dye, resazurin. A thin film of Pt deposited over a glass substrate using the direct current sputtering technique was used as a working bio-electrode for electrochemical readouts. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy was carried out to characterize the Pt thin film. We tested the efficacy of the method using two different strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC-700603) and Escherichia coli (ATCC-25922), against ampicillin, kanamycin and tetracycline. The dye, on incubation with viable bacteria, undergoes reduction and lowers the corresponding peak current value. However, in the presence of an effective antibacterial agent, reduction did not occur due to bacterial cell death and absence of a reducing environment. The electrochemical changes in peak current values were monitored using the differential pulse voltammetry technique and interpretation of the results obtained was based upon changes in peak current values. Our results depict a new methodology where a concentration of 104 cells/mL cells can be detected in less than 4 h. The results were also compared with the conventional disc diffusion method for susceptibility testing which has a bacterial incubation time of 18-24 h. The method can potentially be used for monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial strains towards existing antibacterial agents in an easy, rapid, reliable and inexpensive manner without any pre-cultivation of bacteria.",Detection of Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei using an invasive but non-lethal sampling method in shrimp (Penaeus vannamei).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103459,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 06 07,"The detection of enteric pathogens that cause diseases in shrimp involves the sacrifice of the host to obtain tissue samples for diagnosis. In this study, we describe an invasive but non-lethal sampling methodology using a syringe to collect biopsy samples from the hepatopancreas (HP) of Penaeus vannamei to detect the microsporidian pathogen, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), by qPCR and transmission electron microscopy. EHP was detected in all the infected shrimp by qPCR. The shrimp infected by the microsporidian showed 65% survival at 7 days post-sampling. Transmission electron microscopic examination of the biopsy samples revealed numerous spores of the pathogen. The presence of EHP was further confirmed by histology and in situ hybridization from HP tissue samples. The data shows that a hepatopancreas biopsy could be a viable means of detecting enteric pathogens in shrimp, and the method could be valuable in sampling broodstock and natural populations without the need to sacrifice the animals.",Low serum vitamin D is independently associated with unexplained elevated ALT only among non-obese men in the general population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103458,Annals of hepatology,2019 05 19,"There are inconsistent findings on the association between human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and vitamin D, perhaps due to insufficient specificity for gender and obesity status.

One of the most interesting regions in this regard is the Republic of Tuva. Since most of its territory is covered by mountain ranges and intermountain basins, we were able to study the distribution of vectors and viruses in geographically isolated areas at different altitudes and in various landscapes. From 2008 to 2017, we conducted six expeditions to Tuva and collected 3,077 adult ticks and 24 nymphs. The distribution of tick species was confined to specific landscapes, as follows: Dermacentor nuttalli occurred in steppes, D. silvarum inhabited forest-steppe areas, and Ixodes persulcatus inhabited mixed forests. All three species of ticks were collected on plains and mountain slopes. The range of D. silvarum was shown to be lower than 1300 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Only D. nuttalli and I. persulcatus were collected at higher altitudes. According to our observations, single nymphs of D. nuttalli appear on animals one month before larvae appear. This finding confirms the hypothesis that the immature forms of D. nuttalli are able to overwinter under favourable conditions. We isolated 9 strains and 3 isolates of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) from I. persulcatus, one strain from D. nuttalli and one strain from D. silvarum. The TBEV strain from D. nuttalli was isolated from the territory inhabited only by Dermacentor ticks. All isolated strains belong to the Siberian subtype of TBEV. TBEV was detected in ticks from all the investigated altitudes. There were no statistically significant differences in the virus prevalence between the Dermacentor and Ixodes ticks. The results of our work provide additional support for the hypothesis of the existence of TBEV foci in areas with an absolute dominance of D. nuttalli."

Participants aged ≥25 years (n = 31) of Ghanaian ancestry living in Greater Manchester were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide developed by the researchers. Participants varied in socioeconomic status (SES), gender and migration status. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using a framework approach. Participants offered similar accounts of the social and economic factors influencing food security. Accounts were based on participants' perceptions and/or personal experiences of food insecurity within the community. Participants indicated that they and their fellow Ghanaians can 'manage' even when they described quite challenging food access environments. This has negative implications on their food choices in the UK. Participants reported food insecure households may be reluctant to make use of food banks for fear of 'gossip' and 'pride'. Paradoxically, this reluctance does not extend to close network. Many participants described the church and other social groups as a trusted base in which people operate; support given through these channels is more acceptable than through the 'official context'. Government assisted food banks could partner with the social groups within this community given that these are more trusted.

Biomembranes,2019 06 11,"The beta-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) is an indispensable complex for protein transportation located at the outer membrane of bacteria. BAM is composed of five subunits (BamA-E) in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. DR_0379 is a BamA homolog in Deinococcus radiodurans, but the other subunits have not been detected in this species. In the present study, deletion of bamA resulted in decreased growth rate and altered morphology of D. radiodurans. ΔbamA cells underwent abnormal cell division, leading to aggregated bacteria of diverse size and shape, and the cell envelope was detached from the cell surface, resulting in reduced resistance to high ionic strength. Oxidative stress resistance was significantly enhanced in the mutant, which may be attributed to increased manganese ion concentration and Mn/Fe ratio. Numerous proteins were released into the medium from ΔbamA cells, including surface layer (S-layer) proteins and various transporters located in the periplasm and outer membrane. These results indicate that BamA affects the synthesis and assembly of the outer membrane and S-layer, and thereby influences material transport and cell division. The findings highlight the special functions of BamA in D. radiodurans, and promote our understanding of the multi-layer structure of the D. radiodurans cell envelope.",Dynamic Neural Representations: An Inferential Challenge for fMRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103440,Trends in cognitive sciences,2019 05 19,"Measures of brain activity with high temporal resolution have shown that the information represented in a single brain region undergoes dynamic changes on the scale of milliseconds.

Herein, we studied the importance of DAF in enabling processes that program tolerance in the gut and the eye, two immune-privileged sites where immunosuppressive responses are continuously elicited. Unlike oral feeding or ocular injection of ovalbumin in wild-type (WT) mice, which induced dominant immune tolerance, identical treatment of DAF-/- mice or DAF-/- to WT bone marrow chimeras did not. Although 10% to 30% of mesenteric and submandibular lymph node CD4+ cells became robust T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in WT Foxp3-green fluorescent protein mice, few in either site became Tregs with little suppressor activity in DAF-/- Foxp3-green fluorescent protein mice. Phenotyping of CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) from the ovalbumin-fed DAF-/- mice showed impaired expression of ICOS ligand, PD1-L1, Cx3CR1, CCR7, and CCR9. Analyses of elicited DAF-/- Foxp3+ Tregs showed reduced expression of IRF-8/Aldh1a2 and glycoprotein A repetitions predominant/latency-associated protein associated with Treg transforming growth factor-β production and presentation, as well as integrin β6/integrin β8 associated with Treg and CD103+ DC transforming growth factor-β release.

Crystal structures provide snapshots of the M2R in inactive and active states, but the allosteric link between the ligand binding pocket and cytoplasmic surface remains poorly understood. Here we used solution NMR to examine the structure and dynamics of the M2R labeled with 13CH3-ε-methionine upon binding to various orthosteric and allosteric ligands having a range of efficacy for both G protein activation and arrestin recruitment. We observed ligand-specific changes in the NMR spectra of 13CH3-ε-methionine probes in the M2R extracellular domain, transmembrane core, and cytoplasmic surface, allowing us to correlate ligand structure with changes in receptor structure and dynamics. We show that the M2R has a complex energy landscape in which ligands with different efficacy profiles stabilize distinct receptor conformations.",Structural Basis of Transcription: RNA Polymerase Backtracking and Its Reactivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103420,Molecular cell,2019 05 19,"Regulatory sequences or erroneous incorporations during DNA transcription cause RNA polymerase backtracking and inactivation in all kingdoms of life. Reactivation requires RNA transcript cleavage. Essential transcription factors (GreA and GreB, or TFIIS) accelerate this reaction. We report four cryo-EM reconstructions of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase representing the entire reaction pathway: (1) a backtracked complex; a backtracked complex with GreB (2) before and (3) after RNA cleavage; and (4) a reactivated, substrate-bound complex with GreB before RNA extension. Compared with eukaryotes, the backtracked RNA adopts a different conformation. RNA polymerase conformational changes cause distinct GreB states: a fully engaged GreB before cleavage; a disengaged GreB after cleavage; and a dislodged, loosely bound GreB removed from the active site to allow RNA extension. These reconstructions provide insight into the catalytic mechanism and dynamics of RNA cleavage and extension and suggest how GreB targets backtracked complexes without interfering with canonical transcription.",Down regulation of RANTES in pleural site is associated with inhibition of antigen specific response in tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103419,"Tuberculosis (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 06 04,"Tuberculosis is the most common infectious reason for death and a major cause of pleural effusion globally. To understand the role of chemokines in trafficking of cells during TB pleurisy, we studied the responses to MTB, Ag85A in cells from pleural fluids and peripheral blood. Patients with TB pleural effusions, malignant effusions and asymptomatic healthy controls were enrolled. High expression (p < 0.05) of IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, IL-8, IFN-γ and IL-23 were observed in pleural fluids of TB patients compared to their plasma where expression of RANTES was significantly higher (p < 0.05). On specific stimulation of PFMCs with Ag85A, expression of RANTES was significantly lower in TB compared to NTB patients. We also observed increased expression of T regs and PD1 on CD8+T cells in PFMC of TB patients. Though some of the inflammatory chemokine/cytokines were up-regulated in pleura of TB patients, antigenic stimulation failed to induce them indicating poor antigenic responses at the site. Low expression of RANTES might be a reason for decreased trafficking of cells to the site and dissemination of infection into pleural site. The pattern of RANTES expression in pleural fluid vs serum is interesting. The observations necessitate further studies to investigate the levels of RANTES for its potential biological relevance in TB immunity and its use as a biomarker for diagnosis of pleural TB.",Varied influence of the femoral or tibial component on quadriceps angles: Verified by imaging studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103418,Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,2019 05 19,The aim of this study was to evaluate the varied influence of femoral or tibial component on Quadriceps angles (Q-angle) measured with magnetic resonance image (MRI) and full-length standing scanogram (FLSS) techniques.,Ultrasonographic assessment of quadriceps and patellar tendon thicknesses in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103417,Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,2019 05 19,The aim of this study was to compare ultrasonographically measured quadriceps and patellar tendon thicknesses between Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls.,Effects of Liraglutide and Fenretinide treatments on the diabetic phenotype of neuronal human BACE1 knock-in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103416,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 06 15,"We recently reported that brain-specific human β-secretase 1 (BACE1) knock-in (PLB4), a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), also develops a severe diabetic phenotype characterised by impaired glucose homeostasis, decreased insulin sensitivity and a fatty liver phenotype. Hence, we here aimed to assess if targeted anti-diabetic therapies (Liraglutide and Fenretinide) would attenuate the diabetic and behavioural phenotype of these mice. PLB4 mice and wild-type (WT) controls were administered Liraglutide or Fenretinide for ten consecutive weeks alongside vehicle-treated mice. Physiological (body weight and mass composition, glucose tolerance, serum hormone concentration), behavioural (locomotor activity) and molecular assessments were performed in mice pre- and post-treatment. Liraglutide and Fenretinide treatments inhibited adiposity gain and decreased circulating serum triglyceride (with Liraglutide) and leptin (with Fenretinide) levels in PLB4 mice. We also found that PLB4 mice exhibited increased levels of serum dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), together with up-regulated hepatic expression of Dpp4, retinol binding protein 4 (Rbp4) and sterol regulatory element-binding 1c (Srebp1c), which was normalised by both treatments. Interestingly, Liraglutide treatment slowed down habituation to a novel environment and increased secondary night activity peak in WT mice, suggesting an impact on circadian activity regulation. However, neither treatment improved glucose homeostasis in PLB4 mice, implying that impaired glucose metabolism in this genotype may not be associated with glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and/or RBP4-mediated pathways. In summary, this study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal BACE1-mediated metabolic regulation and implicates BACE1 as a putative regulator of systemic DPP4 levels.","Knee-related quality of life, functional results and osteoarthritis at a minimum of 20 years' follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103415,The Knee,2019 06 08,"Few studies in the literature show results with more than 20 years of follow-up after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).

As the resulting high blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration can have detrimental effects on brain development and function, international guidelines recommend lifelong control of blood Phe concentration with dietary and/or medical therapy. Sapropterin dihydrochloride is a synthetic preparation of tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4), the naturally occurring cofactor of PAH. It acts as a pharmacological chaperone, reducing blood Phe concentration and increasing dietary Phe tolerance in BH4-responsive patients with PAH deficiency. Protocols to establish responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride vary widely. Two meetings were held with an international panel of clinical experts in PKU management to develop recommendations for sapropterin dihydrochloride response testing. At the first meeting, regional differences and similarities in testing practices were discussed based on guidelines, a literature review, outcomes of a global physician survey, and case reports. Statements developed based on the discussions were sent to all participants for consensus (>70% of participants) evaluation using a 7-level rating system, and further discussed during the second meeting. The experts recommend sapropterin dihydrochloride response testing in patients with untreated blood Phe concentrations of 360-2000 μmol/L, except in those with two null mutations. For neonates, a 24-h sapropterin dihydrochloride loading test is recommended; responsiveness is defined as a decrease in blood Phe ≥30%. For older infants, children, adolescents, and adults, a test duration of ≥48 h or a 4-week trial is recommended. The main endpoint for a 48-h to 7-day trial is a decrease in blood Phe, while improved Phe tolerance is the endpoint to be assessed during a longer trial. Longer trials may not be feasible in some locations due to lack of reimbursement for hospitalization, while a 4-week trial may not be possible due to limited access to sapropterin dihydrochloride or public health regulation. A 48-h response test should be considered in pregnant patients who cannot achieve blood Phe ≤360 μmol/L with a Phe-restricted diet. Durability of response and clinical benefits of sapropterin dihydrochloride should be assessed over the long term.

Registered dietitian nutritionists and nutrition and dietetics technicians, registered, in partnership with other practitioners and nutrition educators, should be actively involved in programs that provide coordinated services between the community and health care systems that include regular monitoring and evaluation of programming outcomes. The rapidly growing older population, increased demand for integrated continuous support systems, and rising cost of health care underscore the need for these programs. Programs must include food assistance and meal programs, nutritional screening and assessment, nutrition education, medical nutrition therapy, monitoring, evaluation, and documentation of evidence-based outcomes. Coordination with long-term care services and support systems is necessary to allow older adults to remain in their homes; improve or maintain their health and manage chronic disease; better navigate transitions of care; and reduce avoidable hospital, acute, or long-term care facility admissions. Funding of these programs requires evidence of their effectiveness, especially regarding health, functionality, and health care-related outcomes of interest to individuals, caregivers, payers, and policy makers. Targeting of food and nutrition programs involves addressing unmet needs for services, particularly among those at high risk for poor nutrition. Registered dietitian nutritionists and nutrition and dietetics technicians, registered must increase programmatic efforts to measure outcomes to evaluate community-based food and nutrition services.",Preterm birth: Born too soon for the developing airway epithelium?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103368,Paediatric respiratory reviews,2019 05 19,"Birth prior to term interrupts the normal development of the respiratory system and consequently results in poor respiratory outcomes that persist throughout childhood. The mechanisms underpinning these poor respiratory outcomes are not well understood, but intrinsic abnormalities within the airway epithelium may be a contributing factor. Current evidence suggests that the airway epithelium is both structurally and functionally abnormal after preterm birth, with reports of epithelial thickening and goblet cell hyperplasia in addition to increased inflammation and apoptosis in the neonatal intensive care unit. However, studies focusing on the airway epithelium are limited and many questions remain unanswered; including whether abnormalities are a direct result of interrupted development, a consequence of exposure to inflammatory stimuli in the perinatal period or a combination of the two. In addition, the difficulty of accessing airway tissue has resulted in the majority of evidence being collected in the pre-surfactant era which may not reflect contemporary preterm birth. This review examines the consequences of preterm birth on the airway epithelium and explores the clinical relevance of currently available models whilst highlighting the need to develop a clinically relevant in vitro model to help further our understanding of the airway epithelium in preterm birth.",Effectiveness of a multimodal intervention to increase vaccination in obstetrics/gynecology settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103367,Vaccine,2019 05 27,To test the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention in obstetrics/gynecology (ob-gyn) clinics to increase uptake of influenza and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines in pregnant women and these vaccines plus human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in non-pregnant women.,Effect of a pneumococcal whole cell vaccine on influenza A-induced pneumococcal otitis media in infant mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103366,Vaccine,2019 05 27,"The pneumococcus remains a common cause of otitis media (OM) despite the widespread introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. In mice, a pneumococcal whole cell vaccine (WCV) induces serotype-independent protection against pneumococcal colonisation and invasive disease via TH17- and antibody-mediated immunity, respectively. We investigated the effect of WCV on influenza A-induced pneumococcal OM in an infant mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were immunised subcutaneously with a single dose of WCV or adjuvant at 6 days of age, infected with pneumococci (EF3030 [serotype 19F] or PMP1106 [16F]) at 12 days of age, and given influenza A virus (A/Udorn/72/307 [H3N2], IAV) at 18 days of age to induce pneumococcal OM. Pneumococcal density in middle ear and nasopharyngeal tissues was determined 6 and 12 days post-virus. Experiments were repeated in antibody (B6.μMT-/-)- and CD4+ T-cell-deficient mice to investigate the immune responses involved. A single dose of WCV did not prevent the development of pneumococcal OM, nor accelerate pneumococcal clearance compared with mice receiving adjuvant alone. However, WCV reduced the density of EF3030 in the middle ear at 6 days post-viral infection (p = 0.022), and the density of both isolates in the nasopharynx at 12 days post-viral infection (EF3030, p = 0.035; PMP1106, p = 0.011), compared with adjuvant alone. The reduction in density in the middle ear required antibodies and CD4+ T cells: WCV did not reduce EF3030 middle ear density in B6.μMT-/- mice (p = 0.35) nor in wild-type mice given anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody before and after IAV inoculation (p = 0.91); and WCV-immunised CD4+ T cell-deficient GK1.5 mice had higher levels of EF3030 in the middle ear than their adjuvant-immunised counterparts (p = 0.044).

Recent studies have documented the continuous efforts that are being made in the field of adjuvants research in an attempt to render vaccines more effective. This review article focuses on adjuvants, particularly particulate and non-particulate ones, which have been assessed with VL vaccine candidates in several preclinical and clinical trials outlining the induction of immune responses obtained from these studies. Moreover, we have emphasized the applicability of multiple adjuvants combination for an improvement in the potential of a VL vaccine."

Consequently, their diet changes by the season. We hypothesized that grazing might affect enteric CH4 emissions due to changes in the nutrition, maintenance, and activity of the cows, and they might differentially respond to these factors. This study assessed the repeatability of enteric CH4 emission measurements for Jersey cattle in a commercial organic dairy herd in Denmark. It also evaluated the effects of a gradual transition from indoor winter feeding to outdoor spring grazing. Further, it assessed the individual-level correlations between measurements during the consecutive feeding periods (phenotype × environment, P × E) as neither pedigrees nor genotypes were available to estimate a genotype by environment effect. Ninety-six mixed-parity lactating Jersey cows were monitored for 30 d before grazing and for 24 d while grazing. The cows spent 8 to 11 h grazing each day and had free access to an in-barn automatic milking system (AMS). For each visit to the AMS, milk yield was recorded and logged along with date and time. Monitoring equipment installed in the AMS feed bins continuously measured enteric CH4 and CO2 concentrations (ppm) using a noninvasive ""sniffer"" method. Raw enteric CH4 and CO2 concentrations and their ratio (CH4:CO2) were derived from average concentrations measured during milking and per day for each cow. We used mixed models equations to estimate variance components and adjust for the fixed and random effects influencing the analyzed gas concentrations. Univariate models were used to precorrect the gas measurements for diurnal variation and to estimate the direct effect of grazing on the analyzed concentrations. A bivariate model was used to assess the correlation between the 2 periods (in-barn vs. grazing) for each gas concentration. Grazing had a weak P × E interaction for daily average CH4 and CO2 gas concentrations. Bivariate repeatability estimates for average CH4 and CO2 concentrations and CH4:CO2 were 0.77 to 0.78, 0.73 to 0.80, and 0.26, respectively. Repeatability for CH4:CO2 was low (0.26) but indicated some between-animal variation. In conclusion, grazing does not create significant shifts compared with indoor feeding in how animals rank for average CH4 and CO2 concentrations and CH4:CO2. We found no evidence that separate evaluation is needed to quantify enteric CH4 and CO2 emissions from Jersey cows during in-barn and grazing periods.",A genome-wide association study for susceptibility and infectivity of Holstein Friesian dairy cattle to digital dermatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103307,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"Selection and breeding can be used to fight transmission of infectious diseases in livestock. The prevalence in a population depends on the susceptibility and infectivity of the animals. Knowledge on the genetic background of those traits would facilitate efficient selection for lower disease prevalence. We investigated the genetic background of host susceptibility and infectivity for digital dermatitis (DD), an endemic infectious claw disease in dairy cattle, with a genome-wide association study (GWAS), using either a simple linear mixed model or a generalized linear mixed model based on epidemiological theory. In total, 1,513 Holstein-Friesian cows of 12 Dutch dairy farms were scored for DD infection status and class (M0 to M4.1) every 2 wk for 11 times; 1,401 of these cows were genotyped with a 75k SNP chip. We performed a GWAS with a linear mixed model on 10 host disease status traits, and with a generalized linear mixed model with a complementary log-log link function (GLMM) on the probability that a cow would get infected between 2 scorings. With the GLMM, we fitted SNP effects for host susceptibility and host infectivity, while taking the variation in exposure of the susceptible cow to infectious herd mates into account. With the linear model we detected 4 suggestive SNP (false discovery rate < 0.20), 2 for the fraction of observations a cow had an active lesion on chromosomes 1 and 14, one for the fraction of observations a cow had an M2 lesion on at least one claw on chromosome 1 (the same SNP as for the fraction of observations with an active lesion), and one for the fraction of observations a cow had an M4.1 lesion on at least one claw on chromosome 10. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.09 to 0.37. With the GLMM we did not detect significant nor suggestive SNP. The SNP effects on disease status analyzed with the linear model had a correlation coefficient of only 0.70 with SNP effects on susceptibility of the GLMM, indicating that both models capture partly different effects. Because the GLMM better accounts for the epidemiological mechanisms determining individual disease status and for the distribution of the y-variable, results of the GLMM may be more reliable, despite the absence of suggestive associations. We expect that with an extended GLMM that better accounts for the full genetic variation in infectivity via the environment, the accuracy of SNP effects may increase.","Effect of hydroxyselenomethionine on lactation performance, blood profiles, and transfer efficiency in early-lactating dairy cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103306,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"The current study investigated the effects of hydroxyselenomethionine (HMBSe), a novel organic selenium (Se) additive, on lactation performance, blood profiles, antioxidative status, and transfer efficiency of Se in early-lactation dairy cows. Sixty multiparous early-lactating dairy cows with similar days in milk (57 d; standard deviation = 9.9) and milk yield (36.5 kg/d; standard deviation = 1.42) were fed a basal diet containing 0.04 mg of Se/kg (dry matter basis). These cows were assigned to 1 of 4 groups following a randomized complete block design as follows: control (basal diet) or HMBSe addition (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 mg of Se/kg of dry matter). The experiment lasted for 13 wk, with the first week as adaptation. The results showed that milk yields (raw, protein, and lactose) and feed efficiency were improved in a quadratic manner following increased dietary HMBSe addition, whereas energy-corrected milk, 4% fat-corrected milk, and total solid yields tended to be enhanced quadratically. In terms of whole-blood variables, red blood cell and white blood cell levels were increased quadratically, whereas hemoglobin concentration increased linearly with increased HMBSe addition. Plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations tended to increase linearly along with HMBSe addition. Plasma superoxide dismutase activity increased quadratically with increased HMBSe addition. The total antioxidant capacity in plasma tended to improve quadratically when cows were fed more HMBSe. Moreover, plasma malondialdehyde concentrations of dairy cows tended to decrease in a quadratic manner when dietary HMBSe increased. The Se concentrations in milk, plasma, and milk/plasma ratio increased linearly following increased HMBSe addition. In conclusion, HMBSe improved lactation performance, health status, and milk Se concentrations in early-lactating dairy cows.",Characterizing the metabotype and its persistency in lactating Holstein cows: An approach toward metabolic efficiency measures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103305,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"The variation in feed efficiency among dairy cows is due to differences in fermentation and digestion characteristics, but recent studies have suggested that various aspects of postabsorptive metabolic processes including heat production or the metabolizable energy for maintenance are more crucial. Thus, metabolic efficiency largely determines feed efficiency, but whether divergent feed efficient cows differ in O2 consumption and metabolic CO2 production, directly determining the metabolic rate has not been investigated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine whether variation in ME intake (MEI), O2 consumption, and metabolic CO2 production account for the variation in metabolic efficiency of dairy cows and whether this effect persists across the lactation cycle. Eighteen cows with different German breeding value functional herd life were kept in freestalls with ad libitum access to a total mixed ration that was kept constant in composition throughout the first lactation. Cows were blood sampled and weighed at wk 5, 13, and 42 postpartum (pp) and transferred into respiration chambers. Animals were retrospectively clustered according to MEI, O2 consumption, and metabolic CO2 production, each normalized to metabolic body weight (mBW). Cluster analysis revealed 9 high metabolically efficient (high-Meff) and 9 low metabolically efficient cows. The high-Meff cows had greater MEI and feed conversion efficiency, produced less metabolic CO2 and methane, had a stronger negative energy balance, and tended to have a lower metabolic respiratory quotient. Further, high-Meff cows had lower residual MEI, less heat energy loss, and lower plasma glucose concentrations, but used a greater portion of body reserves instead of feed energy for milk synthesis, particularly at wk 5 and 13 pp. However, these group differences did not persist by wk 42 pp. Cow groups were not different in O2 consumption, milk yield, metabolizable energy for maintenance, or the efficiency of tissue utilization for milk synthesis, but high-Meff cows tended to have the lower German relative breeding value functional herd life, indicating a link between metabolic performance and productive lifespan. In conclusion, the use of a clustering approach involving MEI/mBW, O2/mBW, and CO2/mBW seems to be a promising method to differentiate cows with divergent metabolic efficiency but does not allow identifying an individual metabotype that persists across the whole lactation cycle."

This response might facilitate establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and alter the phenotype of the offspring by modifying the microenvironment of the reproductive tract. Here, we hypothesized that intrauterine infusion of 0.5 mL of seminal plasma at the time of artificial insemination (AI) in first-service lactating Holstein cows will improve pregnancy success after insemination. Cows were inseminated (511 primiparous cows inseminated with X-sorted semen, 554 multiparous cows inseminated with X-sorted semen, and 627 multiparous cows inseminated with conventional semen) using the Double-Ovsynch protocol. Cows were randomly assigned to receive intrauterine infusion of either 0.5 mL of seminal plasma or saline immediately after AI. There was no overall effect of seminal plasma infusion on the percentage of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant at d 32 or 60 after AI, pregnancy loss, or percent of inseminated cows calving. If cows were inseminated with conventional semen, seminal plasma reduced pregnancies at d 32 and tended to reduce calvings. There was no effect of seminal plasma if cows were inseminated with X-sorted semen. Seminal plasma infusion increased the birth weight of heifer calves born using X-sorted semen but not conventional semen. These results do not support a beneficial effect of seminal plasma on pregnancy success after AI, but exposure to seminal plasma may program fetal development to affect phenotype at birth.",Short communication: Persistent contamination by Listeria monocytogenes of bovine raw milk investigated by whole-genome sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103293,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"Following the persistent detection of Listeria monocytogenes in raw bovine milk sold through a vending machine, the 120 lactating cows of the herd producing the milk were subjected to bacteriological investigation. A single cow with subclinical mastitis (1.2-1.3 × 105 somatic cells/mL) and persistent L. monocytogenes excretion was detected. The cow was subjected to antimicrobial therapy, but L. monocytogenes excretion remained high (>3.0 × 102 cfu/mL). Following culling of the infected cow, L. monocytogenes disappeared from the tank milk, and further isolates were recovered from the mammary parenchyma and lymph nodes of the infected cow. To investigate the clonal nature of the contamination, all isolates recovered in the study (n = 13) were analyzed by serogroup PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and whole-genome sequencing. Our results demonstrated the clonal nature of the contamination. All isolates belonged to lineage II, serogroup IIa, sequence type 37, clonal complex 37 and harbored some virulence determinants. This case showed that, although relatively rare, prolonged milk contamination by L. monocytogenes can originate from subclinical and persistently infected cows, posing a health risk to consumers.",Effects of induced weight shift in the hind limbs on claw loads in dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103292,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"The modern dairy industry is plagued by a high prevalence of claw horn lesions in cows, which cause lameness, affect well-being, limit milk production, and are responsible for premature removal of cows from the herd. The lateral hind claws are primarily affected, and this has been linked to a relatively higher load being exerted on the lateral claws when cows shift weight from one hind limb to the other. The vertical ground reaction forces and mean and maximum pressures under the claws were measured in 40 nonlame dairy cows before and during a shift in weight from one hind limb to the other, which was accomplished by applying pressure manually to one side of the pelvis. During square standing on firm ground, about two-thirds of the entire hind limb load was exerted on the 2 lateral claws, and the remaining one-third was exerted on the medial claws combined. At the moment of maximum weight shift, the lateral claw of the loaded limb bore almost two-thirds of the entire load of both hind limbs, with the heel zone bearing almost half of the load of both hind limbs. Subsequently, the load of the lateral claw of the contralateral hind limb decreased, as did the load of both medial claws. Thus, the weight redistribution had occurred predominantly between the lateral hind claws. The high load exerted on a lateral hind claw during weight shift and at maximum weight shift is assumed to play a role in the pathogenesis of claw horn lesions, particularly when accentuated by a softened claw horn and hard flooring.",Reduction of viable Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis in slurry subjected to anaerobic digestion in biogas plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103291,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"Cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) shed the bacterium in their feces. This may lead to considerable concentrations of MAP in slurry, which has been postulated to contribute to MAP transmission when this slurry is used as fertilizer. For other bacterial species, anaerobic digestion has been shown to reduce bacterial load and to increase the safety of organic waste. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of anaerobic digestion in biogas plants on MAP survival in slurry from 16 dairy farms with a history of MAP infection. Presence of MAP was determined using MAP culture and a commercial MAP IS900 quantitative PCR (qPCR) applied on untreated slurry samples, slurry samples after primary fermentation, and digestate. Unfermented slurry samples from most enrolled farms tested positive for MAP, via both culture and qPCR. After the fermentation process, MAP could no longer be cultured in most samples, with the exception of 2 samples from farms where high numbers of MAP-shedding cows were kept at the time of sampling. A Bayesian binomial model predicted a probability of 93% for a MAP-negative culture result after fermentation. In most samples, MAP DNA was still detectable when using the IS900 qPCR. The probability of a negative result in qPCR was estimated to be 27%. Results of this study indicate that subjecting MAP-positive slurry to anaerobic digestion in biogas plants leads to a reduction of viable MAP below the detection limit; however, MAP DNA remained detectable. It remains undetermined whether MAP DNA detected in fermentation products is a residue of MAP degradation or belongs to viable MAP below the detection limit or in a dormant state. In conclusion, subjecting MAP-positive slurry to anaerobic mesophilic digestion reduces viable MAP concentration below the detection limit. The use of digestion products as fertilizer on pasture and agricultural soils instead of untreated slurry may therefore reduce the risk of MAP transmission.",The nutrient requirements of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and their application to fermented milk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103290,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 19,"Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) performs many physiological functions, but the fermentation time is long when fermented milk is prepared using LGG alone. To shorten the fermentation time, we analyzed the nutrient requirement profiles of LGG. Based on nutrient requirement profiles, we evaluated the effects on the fermentation time, quality, and sensory properties of unmodified cow's milk fermented by LGG alone. According to the consumption and necessary patterns of amino acids and those of purine, pyrimidine, vitamins, metal ions, and nutrients essential to LGG, we selected Cys, Ser, Arg, Pro, Asp, Glu, guanine, uracil, and xanthine with which to supplement milk. Compared with fermented milk prepared using LGG alone in unmodified milk, the fermentation time of supplemented milk was shortened by 5 h. Viable cell counts, titratable acidity, and water-retaining capability of the fermented milk were improved by addition of nutrient supplements.

In lupus-prone NZM2328 mice, the occurrence of lupus GN was accompanied by a decrease in Treg cells and an increase in proinflammatory cytokine-producing T cells. Because IL-33 in addition to IL-2 has been shown to be important for Treg cell proliferation and ST2 (IL-33 receptor) positive Treg cells are more potent in suppressor activity, a hybrid cytokine with active domains of IL-2 and IL-33 was generated to target the ST2+ Treg cells as a therapeutic agent to treat lupus GN. Three mouse models were used: spontaneous and Ad-IFNα- accelerated lupus GN in NZM2328 and the lymphoproliferative autoimmune GN in MRL/lpr mice. Daily injections of IL233 for 5 days prevented Ad-IFNα-induced lupus GN and induced remission of spontaneous lupus GN. The remission was permanent in that no relapses were detected. The remission was accompanied by persistent elevation of Treg cells in the renal lymph nodes. IL233 is more potent than IL-2 and IL-33 either singly or in combination in the treatment of lupus GN. The results of this study support the thesis that IL233 should be considered as a novel agent for treating lupus GN.",Nanoparticles conjugated with bacteria targeting tumors for precision imaging and therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103266,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"The hypoxic region microenvironment reduces the susceptibility of the cancer cells to radiotherapy and anticancer drugs of the solid tumors.

In our strategy, anaerobic bacterium Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) that colonizes selectively in hypoxic regions of animal body was successfully used as a vehicle to conjugate with PLGA NPs and transported into solid tumors. To improve the efficacy and specificity of tumor therapy, low-boiling point perfluorohexane (PFH) liquid was wrapped in the core of PLGA NPs (PFH/PLGA NPs), which could increase the deposition of energy by affecting the acoustic environment of the tumor and destroy cells after liquid-gas phase transition during High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) irradiation.

In recent years, the widespread use of new drugs based on bortezomib (Btz) has significantly improved the remission rate of MM patients. However, drug resistance and disease relapse occur within a few years and MM is still considered to be an incurable disease. The amplification of the long arm of chromosome 1 is one of the most common genetic abnormalities in MM patients. Here, we found that long non-coding RNA ANGPTL1-3 which located in 1q region was overexpressed in MM. Lnc-ANGPTL1-3 expression was correlated with MM International Staging System (ISS) and overall survival. Notably, knockdown of lnc-ANGPTL1-3 increased Btz sensitivity of MM cells. Following exploration revealed that lnc-ANGPTL1-3 competitively interacted with miR-30a-3p to c-Maf, a transcription factor which was reported to be associated with Btz resistance. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that lnc-ANGPTL1-3/miR-30a-3p/c-Maf axis plays a critical role in MM Btz resistance.",Bob1 enhances RORγt-mediated IL-17A expression in Th17 cells through interaction with RORγt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103264,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"POU domain class 2-associating factor 1 (also called Bob1), which is mainly expressed in B cells, regulates B cell homeostasis and controls humoral immune responses. Although Bob1 is known to function reliably in T cell subsets including follicular helper T cells, Th1 cells and Th2 cells, it is unknown whether Bob1 functions in other T cell subsets. In this study, we found that Bob1 knock out (KO) mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by MOG35-55 peptide and that Bob1 KO T cells are defective in Th17 differentiation. Importantly, Bob1 interacts with retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR) gamma t (RORγt), a signature transcription factor for Th17 cells, through the ligand-binding domain of RORγt, thereby enhancing IL-17A transcription activity. IL-17A induction by Bob1 requires the ability for its formation of a DNA-Oct1-Bobl ternary complex. Thus, our findings demonstrate that Bob1 enhances IL-17A expression in vivo and in vitro by interacting with RORγt in Th17 cells, suggesting that Bob1 plays a pivotal role in Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.",Intracellular Doppler Spectroscopy detects altered drug response in SKOV3 tumor spheroids with silenced or inhibited P-glycoprotein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103263,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"Intracellular Doppler spectroscopy is a form of low-coherence digital holography based upon Doppler detection of scattered light that measures drug response/resistance in tumor spheroids, xenografts, and clinical biopsies. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the main causes of ineffective cancer treatment. One MDR mechanism is mediated by the MDR1 gene that encodes the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Overexpression of Pgp in some cancers is associated with poor chemotherapeutic response. This paper uses intracellular Doppler spectroscopy to detect Pgp-mediated changes to drug response in 3D tissues grown from an ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3). The SKOV3 cell line was incrementally exposed to cisplatin to create a cell line with increased Pgp expression (SKOV3cis). Subsequently, MDR1 in a subset of these cells was silenced in SKOV3cis using shRNA to create a doxycycline inducible, Pgp-silenced cell line (SKOV3cis-sh). A specific Pgp inhibitor, zosuquidar, was used to study the effects of Pgp inhibition on the Doppler spectra. Increased drug sensitivity was observed with Pgp silencing or inhibition as determined by drug IC50s of paclitaxel-response of silenced Pgp and doxorubicin-response of inhibited Pgp, respectively. These results indicate that intracellular Doppler spectroscopy can detect changes in drug response due to silencing or inhibition of a single protein associated with drug resistance with important consequences for personalized medicine.",Circ_ORC2 enhances the regulatory effect of miR-19a on its target gene PTEN to affect osteosarcoma cell growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103262,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant and aggressive bone tumor. Its occurrence and development involve many factors and multiple signaling pathways. Some studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in the development of various tumors. This research showed that circ_ORC2 was generally up-regulated in various osteosarcoma cell lines, and mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Circ_ORC2 had the binding site of miR-19a, and its expression was positively correlated with miR-19a expression. RIP experiments showed that circ_ORC2 could bind to Ago2 protein. RNA pull-down using biotinylated circ_ORC2 or miR-19a showed that circ_ORC2 could directly interact with miR-19a, and dual luciferase reporter gene assay also confirmed that miR-19a could bind to circ_ORC2. After circ_ORC2 knockdown, miR-19a expression was down-regulated, but the downstream target gene PTEN expression was up-regulated, and the phosphorylation level of Akt was reduced, which indicated that circ_ORC2 enhanced the inhibition of miR-19a on PTEN expression by combining miR-19a. Further functional experiments showed that after circ_ORC2 knockdown, cell proliferation and invasion decreased, while the apoptosis level increased. When co-transfected with circ_ORC2 siRNA and miR-19a mimics or PTEN siRNA, the above cell biological behaviors did not change significantly. Therefore, circ_ORC2 binds with miR-19a and enhances its expression, thereby inhibiting downstream PTEN expression and activating Akt pathway to promote osteosarcoma cell growth and invasion. These findings enrich the circRNA molecular regulation mechanism, and provide more reference ideas for the research and application of circRNAs in tumors and other diseases."

A total of 20 prostate patients were selected retrospectively and divided into 2 groups of VMAT plans using prescriptions of 60 Gy/20 fx and 79 Gy/38 fx. Inverse treatment planning optimized by the PO and PRO algorithm based on the dual-arc technique was carried out by the Eclipse treatment planning system. The maximum dose, minimum dose, mean dose, dose-volume points, and dose-volume indices of the targets and organs at risk (OAR) were calculated from the plans. In addition, radiobiological parameters such as tumor control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of the targets and OAR were determined based on their dose-volume histograms (DVHs). A paired Student's t-test was carried out to compare the difference between mean dose-volume points, radiobiological parameters, and dose-volume indices. Two-tailed p < 0.05 was defined as having statistical difference. For prostate VMAT plans optimized by the PO algorithm, equal or slightly larger mean dose and TCP of the PTV (1% for 60 Gy/20 fx and 0.2% for 78 Gy/39 fx) were found by comparing to the PRO. These were followed by finding the slightly larger conformity index (CI; 0.927 vs 0.895 and 0.910 vs 0.904), larger or equal homogeneity index (HI; 0.054 vs 0.052 and 0.058 vs 0.058), and smaller gradient index (GI; 1.366 vs 2.288 and 1.585 vs 1.742) of the PTV using plans optimized by the PO vs PRO using prescriptions of 60 Gy/20 fx and 78 Gy/39 fx. For the OAR, we found that the mean doses, NTCPs, and EUDs of the rectum, bladder, and femur were slightly larger for plans optimized by the PO algorithm compared to the PRO, though both optimization algorithms satisfied all the dose-volume criteria and objectives in the inverse planning. Both the PO and PRO algorithm can generate prostate VMAT plans fulfilling the required dose-volume criteria. It is concluded that plans optimized by the PO algorithm can produce prostate plan with very similar quality compared to PRO.",Too Scared to Teach?

For early adolescents the relationships with their parents influenced the levels of FA the most (such as withdrawal, conflict, and relapse), whereas peer relationships (such as, peer alienation) were the most relevant for adolescents. Our study provides support to the role of attachment to peers and parents as a risk factor for symptoms of FA. In line with developmental theories, parents and peers acquire a different weight in predicting the relationship between attachment and FA for early adolescents and adolescents respectively.

To understand how molecular interactions between the cytoskeletal elements generate forces, a number of in vitro experiments have been performed but are limited in their ability to accurately reproduce the diversity of motor mobility. In myosin motility assays, myosin heads are fixed on a surface and glide F-actin. By contrast, in reconstituted gels, the motion of both myosin and F-actin is unrestricted. Because only these two extreme conditions have been used, the importance of mobility of motors for network behaviors has remained unclear. In this study, to illuminate the impacts of motor mobility on the contractile behaviors of the actin cytoskeleton, we employed an agent-based computational model based on Brownian dynamics. We find that if motors can bind to only one F-actin like myosin I, networks are most contractile at intermediate mobility. In this case, less motor mobility helps motors stably pull F-actins to generate tensile forces, whereas higher motor mobility allows F-actins to aggregate into larger clustering structures. The optimal intermediate motor mobility depends on the stall force and affinity of motors that are regulated by mechanochemical rates. In addition, we find that the role of motor mobility can vary drastically if motors can bind to a pair of F-actins. A network can exhibit large contraction with high motor mobility because motors bound to antiparallel pairs of F-actins can exert similar forces regardless of their mobility. Results from this study imply that the mobility of molecular motors may critically regulate contractile behaviors of actin networks in cells."

However, determining the copy number of proteins within these nanoclusters constitutes a major challenge because of unknown labeling stoichiometries and complex fluorophore photophysics. We previously developed a DNA-origami-based calibration approach to extract protein copy number from super-resolution images. However, the applicability of this approach is limited by the fact that the calibration is dependent on the specific labeling and imaging conditions used in each experiment. Hence, the calibration must be repeated for each experimental condition, which is a formidable task. Here, using cells stably expressing dynein intermediate chain fused to green fluorescent protein (HeLa IC74 cells) as a reference sample, we demonstrate that the DNA-origami-based calibration data we previously generated can be extended to super-resolution images taken under different experimental conditions, enabling the quantification of any green-fluorescent-protein-fused protein of interest. To do so, we first quantified the copy number of dynein motors within nanoclusters in the cytosol and along the microtubules. Interestingly, this quantification showed that dynein motors form assemblies consisting of more than one motor, especially along microtubules. This quantification enabled us to use the HeLa IC74 cells as a reference sample to calibrate and quantify protein copy number independently of labeling and imaging conditions, dramatically improving the versatility and applicability of our approach.",Mechanical Properties of Chondrocytes Estimated from Different Models of Micropipette Aspiration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103225,Biophysical journal,2019 06 11,"In this study, two viscoelastic creep expressions for the aspirated length of individual solid-like cells undergoing micropipette aspiration (MPA) were derived based on our previous studies wherein the cell size relative to the micropipette and the cell compressibility were taken into account. Next, three mechanical models of MPA, the half-space model (HSM), incompressible sphere model (ICSM), and compressible sphere model (CSM), were employed to fit the MPA data of chondrocytes. The results indicated that the elastic moduli and viscoelastic parameters of chondrocytes for the ICSM and CSM exhibited significantly higher values than those from the HSM (p < 0.001) because of the considerations of the geometric parameter (ξ) and the compressibility of the cell (ν). For the normal chondrocytes, the elastic moduli obtained from the ICSM and CSM (ν = 0.3) were 47.4 and 78.9% higher than those from the HSM. In the viscoelasticity, the parameters k1, k2, and μ for the ICSM were respectively increased by 37.8, 37.9, and 39.0% compared to those from the HSM, whereas for the CSM (ν = 0.3), the above parameters were 135, 314, and 257% higher compared to those from the HSM. And with the increase of ξ and ν, the above mechanical parameters decreased. Furthermore, the thresholds of ξ varying with ν were obtained for the given values of relative errors caused by the HSM in the elastic and viscoelastic parameters. The above findings obviously indicated that the geometric parameter of MPA and the Poisson's ratio of a cell have marked influences on the determination of cellular mechanical parameters by MPA and thus should be considered in the pursuit of more accurate investigations of the mechanical properties of cells.",Clinicopathological features of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma with a diameter less than or equal to 5 mm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103218,American journal of otolaryngology,2019 06 14,"This retrospective study was conducted to assess the epidemiological, clinical and histologic characteristics of incidentally identified and presurgically diagnosed papillary thyroid microcarcinomas less than or equal to 5 mm in size (small PTMC).",Renal Infarction and Its Consequences for Renal Function in Patients With Cardiac Amyloidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103217,Mayo Clinic proceedings,2019 06 07,To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for renal infarction (RI) in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.,Dynamics of impaired humour processing in schizophrenia - An EEG effective connectivity study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103215,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 19,"Specific language and communication abilities, such as humour comprehension, are commonly impaired in schizophrenia. The present study investigates the dynamics of the humour-related neural network underlying this deficit. Specifically, we focused on the abnormalities of information flow in schizophrenia within the fronto-temporo-parietal circuit. We estimated the direction and strength of cortical information flow in the time course of humour processing by the EEG Directed Transfer Function. The study included 40 schizophrenia outpatients and 40 healthy controls (age-sex-education matched) assessed with an EEG punchline-based humour comprehension task (written and cartoon jokes). The linear mixed models procedure was used to test group effects across three processes: 1. incongruity detection, 2. incongruity resolution and elaboration, 3. complete humour processing. Conjunction maps for both types of jokes were created to investigate fundamental between-group differences, beyond the context of modality. Clinical subjects indicated a lower level of understanding of the funny punchlines, indicated absurd punchlines as more understandable and gave higher funniness ratings to both absurd and neutral punchlines. The EEG effective connectivity results revealed that humour processing in schizophrenia engages alternative circuits, exhibiting a pronounced abnormal leftward shifted lateralization related to diminished activity of the right hemisphere in fronto-temporo-parietal regions. In conclusion, the present paper presents the dynamics of cortical propagation of information in the humour-related circuit as a neural substrate of humour impairment in schizophrenia.",Incorporating holism in nursing education through the Integrative Student Growth Model (ISGM).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103212,Applied nursing research : ANR,2019 05 19,"The concept of holism is threaded throughout nursing. Holistic nursing practice has emerged as a prevalent concept in the provision of quality nursing care, calling nurses to focus on the whole person. Holistic self-care has been said to prevent burn-out, decrease compassion fatigue, and promote workplace civility. However, strategies for teaching holism in nursing education are lacking. The Integrative Student Growth Model (ISGM) offers an innovative, systems-based model for nurse educators to teach abstract values integral to professional nursing practice such as caring, holism, inclusiveness, integrity and excellence. This article discusses one aspect of the Integrative Student Growth Model, holism, which can be integrated at three defined levels present in all nursing programs. The authors propose a conceptual definition of holistic nursing education and suggest strategies for creating a holistic academic environment at each of the three levels.

Therefore, the design of portable sensors for efficiently monitoring trace amounts of OTC in foods is vital to maintain safe food supply in our daily life. Herein, a two-dimensional (2D) molecularly imprinted photonic crystal hydrogel (MIPCH) sensor for the detection of OTC was fabricated by combining the photonic crystal (PC) method and molecular imprinting technique. In this regard, OTC was used as imprinted template to form the MIPCH sensor with specific binding sites during polymerization. After the removal of template, the obtained MIPCH possessed the specific nanocavities that were complementary to target compound, OTC. In addition, the response of the MIPCH to tetracyclines (TCs) in aqueous solution was monitored through a readable change of Debye diffraction ring, which is related to the particle spacing variation of MIPCH in response to the target molecules. As the concentration of OTC increased from 0 to 60 μM, the particle spacing of MIPCH sensor increased to about 94 nm and the structural color redshifted from blue to red. More importantly, the detection of OTC in milk sample by this portable, cost-effective MIPCH sensor has also been achieved at the same range of OTC. With the increasing concentration of OTC in milk sample, the particle spacing of MIPCH sensor increased about 92 nm and the structural color of MIPCH changed from blue through green to orange.",Rapid synthesis of Au/Ag bimetallic nanoclusters with highly biochemical stability and its applications for temperature and ratiometric pH sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103171,Analytica chimica acta,2019 05 19,"Herein, we developed a simple and rapid strategy to synthesize gold/silver bimetallic nanoclusters (Au/Ag NCs) with highly biochemical stability by a one-pot route.

The as-obtained Au/Ag NCs displayed bright orange fluorescence with an emission peak located at 570 nm and temperature-dependent fluorescence property, which were utilized as fluorescent thermometer directly. More intriguingly, the Au/Ag NCs were very stable against various pH values, ions, biothiols, H2O2, fetal bovine serum (FBS), RPMI 1640 medium and amino acids. Taking advantage of the excellent biochemical stability, a ratiometric fluorescence biosensor, fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-Au/Ag NCs, was constructed for pH sensing based on the incorporation of FITC into the Au/Ag NCs.

Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) was shown to allow the assessment of such nonadherence in blood and urine sample. However, their sampling may represent a logistical challenge and are often not favored by the patients. We questioned whether oral fluid (OF) might be an easier accessible alternative matrix for adherence monitoring of cardiovascular drugs (CD). A qualitative method for adherence monitoring of 78 commonly prescribed cardiovascular drugs in OF using LC high-resolution MS (LC-HRMS/MS) was therefore developed, validated, and used to study the presence of antihypertensive medication in OF. Selectivity, ion suppression and enhancement due coeluting analytes, carry over, limits of detection (LOD), limits of identification (LOI), recovery (RE), matrix effects (ME), and process efficiency (PE) were investigated. For demonstrating applicability, over 50 OF samples were investigated and data were compared to findings in blood and urine. Selectivity in OF was given for all compounds via their MS2 spectra and no total suppression of signals could be observed. Determined LOI in OF for ten analytes was higher than the given therapeutic plasma concentration. Furthermore, RE, ME, and PE were in acceptable ranges for more than 65% of the compounds. In total, 208 prescriptions of CD to 57 patients were analyzed and demonstrated the suitability of for adherence monitoring in principle. OF was comparable to plasma regarding the drug categories and the frequencies of hits, except for acidic compounds but more hits could be found in urine samples.

Herein, we presented an integrated virtual multistage MS strategy to identify intact glycopeptides, which allowed the determination of site-specific glycoforms. In this strategy, the enzymatically de-glycosylated peptides and intact glycopeptides were mixed and analyzed in the same LC-MS/MS run. The acquired MS2 spectra of intact glycopeptides allowed determination of the glycans, and the MS2 spectra of the de-glycosylated peptides enabled the identification of peptide backbone sequences. Compared with the conventional multistage strategy, the peptide backbones could be directly identified by the MS2 of the de-glycopeptides with higher sensitivity. This strategy was first validated by analyzing the glycosites and site-specific glycoforms of mouse liver tissues. Then, it was applied to differential analysis of the glycoproteomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent liver tissues. Compared with the identification scheme using only MS2 spectra of intact glycopeptides or glycosites, this approach enabled quantitative analysis on two levels, i.e. glycosites and site-specific glycoforms, simultaneously.

These molecules are able to mediate signal conduction processes of cells, acting as G protein-coupled receptors (GPR) activators and histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors. It was reported that SCFAs were closely associated with various human diseases. However, it is still challenging to analyze SCFAs because of their diverse structures and broad range of concentrations. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive method for simultaneous detection of 34 SCFAs by stable isotope labeling coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. In this respect, a pair of isotope labeling reagents, N-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)aniline (4-AMBA) and N-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)aniline-d5 (4-AMBA-d5), were synthesized to label SCFAs from the feces of mice and SCFA standards, respectively. The 4-AMBA-d5 labeled SCFAs were used as internal standards to compensate the ionization variances resulting from matrix effect and thus minimize quantitation deviation in MS detection. After 4-AMBA labeling, the retention of SCFAs on the reversed-phase column increased and the separation resolution of isomers were improved. In addition, the MS responses of most SCFAs were enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude compared to unlabeled SCFAs. The limits of detection (LODs) of SCFAs were as low as 0.005 ng/mL. Moreover, good linearity for 34 SCFAs was obtained with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.9846 to 0.9999 and the intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were <17.8% and 15.4%, respectively, indicating the acceptable reproducibility of the developed method. Using the developed method, we successfully quantified 21 SCFAs from the feces of mice. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and t-test analysis showed that the contents of 9 SCFAs were significantly different between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and wide type (WT) mice fecal samples. Compared to WT mice, the contents of propionic acid, isobutyric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and 3-hydroxyisocaleric acid were decreased in AD mice, while lactic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, levulinic acid, and valpronic acid were increased in AD mice. These significantly changed SCFAs in the feces of AD mice may afford to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.

However, the inherent hydrophobicity and strong π-π interaction make OMCs have an advantage for the adsorption of nonpolar pollutants, leading to great demands for the development of new-type OMCs with outstanding adsorption efficiencies towards polar pollutants. The zirconium and nitrogen co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (Zr/N-OMC) was obtained by directly carbonizing the composites of phenolic resin and UiO-66-NH2, with uniform mesopore structure, large surface area (583 m2 g-1) and widely dispersed heteroatoms. Due to these prominent properties, the Zr/N-OMC was fabricated as high-performance solid phase microextraction coating. The results proved that the doping zirconium and nitrogen could act as active sites to interact with polar pollutants, resulting in fast adsorption rate and enhanced adsorption capacity. Therefore, the high-performance Zr/N-OMC-coated fiber was coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to establish sensitive analytical method for the detection of trace phenols from real water samples. This work would open up a new avenue for simple and efficient modification of OMC with enhanced adsorption performance to expand applications.",Targeting bioactive compounds in natural extracts - Development of a comprehensive workflow combining chemical and biological data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103165,Analytica chimica acta,2019 05 19,"In natural product drug discovery, several strategies have emerged to highlight specifically bioactive compound(s) within complex mixtures (fractions or crude extracts) using metabolomics tools. In this area, a great deal of interest has raised among the scientific community on strategies to link chemical profiles and associated biological data, leading to the new field called ""biochemometrics"". This article falls into this emerging research by proposing a complete workflow, which was divided into three major steps. The first one consists in the fractionation of the same extract using four different chromatographic stationary phases and appropriated elution conditions to obtain five fractions for each column. The second step corresponds to the acquisition of chemical profiles using HPLC-HRMS analysis, and the biological evaluation of each fraction. The last step evaluates the links between the relative abundances of molecules present in fractions (peak area) and the global bioactivity level observed for each fraction. To this purpose, an original bioinformatics script (encoded with R Studio software) using the combination of four statistical models (Spearman, F-PCA, PLS, PLS-DA) was here developed leading to the generation of a ""Super list"" of potential bioactive compounds together with a predictive score. This strategy was validated by its application on a marine-derived Penicillium chrysogenum extract exhibiting antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells). After the three steps of the workflow, one main compound was highlighted as responsible for the bioactivity and identified as ergosterol. Its antiproliferative activity was confirmed with an IC50 of 0.10 μM on MCF-7 cells. The script efficiency was further demonstrated by comparing the results obtained with a different recently described approach based on NMR profiling and by virtually modifying the data to evaluate the computational tool behaviour. This approach represents a new and efficient tool to tackle some of the bottlenecks in natural product drug discovery programs."

To assist in recovery, the overflow method can be employed to stimulate the affected limb, using the healthy contralateral lower limb (LL) to activate the plegic upper limb (UL) musculature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of overflow using the PNF method on the plegic upper limb muscles of post-stroke individuals in the acute and chronic stages, as well as on the muscles of healthy individuals. A total of 22 individuals participated in the work, comprising 8 healthy individuals (control group), 6 post-stroke acute stage individuals (acute group), and 8 post-stroke chronic stage individuals (chronic group). The participants were assessed using a questionnaire with sections for personal and disease data and application of the ICF scale and the Fugl-Meyer index. The three groups were submitted to electromyographic evaluation, using the posterior deltoid (PD), anterior deltoid (AD), pectoralis major (PM), and external oblique (EO) muscles in four different positions: P1 (resting the UL, with the LL contralateral to the affected limb positioned in diagonal); P2 (resting the UL, with manual resistance in the contralateral LL); P3 (affected UL positioned in diagonal, with manual resistance in the contralateral LL) e P4 (affected UL positioned in diagonal, with fixed point and manual resistance in the contralateral LL). The electromyography results revealed no significant differences between most of the positions for the four muscles evaluated (p > 0.05). However, high clinical relevance (d > 0.8) was found for muscle activation in positions 2 and 4. It could be concluded that for post-stroke individuals in the acute and chronic stages, overflow using PNF effectively increased activation of the PD, AD, PM, and EO muscles in the P2, as well as position 4.",The effects of passive stretching on the blood glucose levels of patients with type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103126,Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,2019 05 19,Type 2 diabetes is characterized by poor glycemic control due to decreased insulin sensitivity.

Herein we describe the case of a 65-year-old man who sought rehabilitation services for left groin pain following a period of intense trekking and uphill walking. He presented with left hip flexor weakness and local tenderness over the left iliopsoas tendon with negative findings on neurological evaluation. Additionally, he presented with left hip capsule and hip flexor tightness with left gluteus maximus and gluteus medius weakness. The left hip capsule tightness was predominantly in the posterior fibres, with restriction of hip internal rotation. The clinical picture overall was suggestive of the presence of risk parameters for iliopsoas tendinopathy. Plain radiographs of the hip revealed mild degenerative changes with a mild pincer impingement. While his clinical and radiological picture was suggestive of degenerative and soft tissue pathology of the hip, a real-time sonographic study was useful in the quantitative confirmation of a partial tear of the left iliopsoas tendon. Additionally, a repeat sonographic study performed four weeks later, revealed a healing iliopsoas tendon seen as a decrease in the width of the hypoechoic presentation of the tear. To summarize, the value of musculoskeletal sonography as a diagnostic tool as well as the assessment of the progression of tendon healing is discussed. Sonography is safe, noninvasive, and does not use ionizing radiation. It is steadily gaining popularity in the diagnosis of tendon lesions.",Ultrasonographic assessment of patellar tendon thickness at 16 clinically relevant measurement sites - A study of intra- and interrater reliability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103118,Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,2019 05 19,To determine intra- and interrater reliability of ultrasonographic imaging (USI) measurements of patellar tendon (PT) thickness using 16 measurement sites covering the entire tendon.,Is there a difference in response to manual cranial bone tissue assessment techniques between participants with cervical and/or temporomandibular complaints versus a control group?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103117,Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,2019 05 19,"Manual cranial bone tissue techniques (CBTT) are used by physiotherapists as a tool for assessment and treatment of complaints in the craniocervical, face, and head regions.

Ten healthy females with more than 3 months of continuous yoga experience who practiced at least 1.5 h per week were recruited. EMG activity was recorded from the aforementioned muscles during mountain pose (""rest"") for 30 s, three times. Subjects then performed the following yoga poses in a randomized sequence while surface EMG activity was recorded: tree pose, half-moon, and warrior III. Each pose was held for 20s to 30 s and performed three times. EMG data were band pass filtered and the root mean square (RMS) was obtained. The peak RMS of each of the resting trials was obtained and averaged to produce an average peak resting RMS value. The study revealed significantly greater EMG activity in TA and GA in all three poses when compared to BF and RF. BF produced greater EMG activity than RF in warrior III.

The objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of Fascial Manipulation® (FM) as a preventative measure in semi-professional athletes with CAI, and to monitor the symptomatology, equilibrium and ROM of the injured ankle. A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in the rehabilitation department of a medical centre. Twenty-nine semi-professional male footballers were recruited. Nine subjects with no previous symptomatology, were assigned to a baseline group, twenty symptomatic subjects were randomized into either the study or the control group. All three groups followed a specific training program. The control group followed normal training protocols and received standard medical care. The study group received an additional three FM treatment sessions. Symptomatology and ROM outcomes were recorded for all players at baseline, before each treatment for the treatment group, and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. At one year, an additional follow-up on was performed via phone. Four severe ankle traumas and one mild ankle trauma were reported in the control group during the trial period. The 6-month outcomes in the study group showed statistically significant improvements. The 1-year follow-up reported the absence of any reported trauma in the study group. FM was effective in improving ROM and symptomatology in footballers with CAI. FM intervention was effective in preventing injury in the study sample."

In our study, we evaluated the association between renal cell cancer and cardiometabolic index (CMI) which meets the main components of the metabolic syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 310 consecutive patients with RCC who underwent radical nephrectomy at our institution. We evaluated the tumour size, histologic subtype, Fuhrman nuclear grade. CMI was calculated as the product of waist circumference (WC) to waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-c). CMI were statistically higher in patients with tumour size ≥ 7 cm than those &lt; 7 cm (p&lt;0.05). Mean CMI level was 2.34 ± 0.84 in patients with high tumour size; and 1.18 ± 0.74 in the other group. The patients with high tumour size had higher TG levels, higher WC and lower HDL-c levels. Similarly, CMI levels were statistically higher in patients with Fuhrman grade 3 and 4 than patients with Fuhrman grade 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.001). The patients with high Fuhrman grade had higher TG levels, higher WC and lower HDL-c levels. The simplicity of WC and height measurement and TG and HDL assessment make CMI an easily applicable index for the evaluation of cardiovascular dysfunction.

The aim of this study was to describe gastric pH in rats at fasted state and to evaluate its changes induced by pentagastrin or omeprazole in order to mimic gastric pH at fasted and fed human subjects. Twenty Wistar rats, fasting for 12 h, were randomly assigned into four treatment groups (n=5): control, pre-treated with omeprazole 2 h before pH measurement, pre-treated with omeprazole 12 h before pH measurement, and pre-treated with pentagastrin 20 min before pH measurement. An incision on the stomach wall was made in anesthetized animals, and pH of gastric juice was measured. The observed pH values were significantly different among groups (p=0.0341), with the median (IQR) values of gastric pH of 3.5 (2.7-4.2), 6.7 (4.7-7.0), 5.6 (3.5-6.4) and 2.2 (1.6-3.1) in control, omeprazole 2 h, omeprazole 12 h and pentagastin group, respectively.

The Tongling Shuimuchong tailings reservoir contains a large amount of sulfide minerals, especially pyrrhotite and pyrite. This reservoir features obvious oxidation in the surface layer, and the slab is very hard. Mineralogical and environmental geochemical analyses were performed on tailings with different degrees of oxidation in the Shuimuchong tailings reservoir to investigate the influence of the formation of the hard oxidized layer on environmental pollution in the tailings pond. The samples were first subjected to particle-size analysis. The shallow tailings were mainly composed of medium particle; the proportions of coarse particle and fine tailings particles were equal; and the proportions of clay and silt were less than those of the other size fractions. Mineralogical analysis showed that pyrrhotite and pyrite were replaced by residual structures in the oxide layer. The secondary minerals goethite, hematite and jarosite were attached to the edges and fractures of sulfide minerals. The samples were geochemically analyzed to determine the total concentrations of 5 elements, the pH and the major anions. The maximum SO42- concentrations of 33,970 and 32,749 mg/kg were observed at a depth of 40 cm in profiles 1 and 2, respectively. Metal sulfide mineral oxidation in the tailings lowered the pH of the materials to values less than 4. The concentration of HCO3- (122-635 mg/kg) in the tailings samples was very low, and the concentration of CO32- was zero. As (53.2-133.7 mg/kg), Pb (24.2-307.5 mg/kg) and Hg (0.03-0.06 mg/kg) were concentrated in the highly oxidized layer at the surface; the Cd content (0.23-10.5 mg/kg) increased with decreasing oxidation degree of the tailings; and the Cr content (38.0-54.9 mg/kg) fluctuated around a certain value.",Current evidence for a role of epigenetic mechanisms in response to ionizing radiation in an ecotoxicological context.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103007,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"The issue of potential long-term or hereditary effects for both humans and wildlife exposed to low doses (or dose rates) of ionising radiation is a major concern. Chronic exposure to ionising radiation, defined as an exposure over a large fraction of the organism's lifespan or even over several generations, can possibly have consequences in the progeny. Recent work has begun to show that epigenetics plays an important role in adaptation of organisms challenged to environmental stimulae. Changes to so-called epigenetic marks such as histone modifications, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs result in altered transcriptomes and proteomes, without directly changing the DNA sequence. Moreover, some of these environmentally-induced epigenetic changes tend to persist over generations, and thus, epigenetic modifications are regarded as the conduits for environmental influence on the genome. Here, we review the current knowledge of possible involvement of epigenetics in the cascade of responses resulting from environmental exposure to ionising radiation. In addition, from a comparison of lab and field obtained data, we investigate evidence on radiation-induced changes in the epigenome and in particular the total or locus specific levels of DNA methylation. The challenges for future research and possible use of changes as an early warning (biomarker) of radiosensitivity and individual exposure is discussed. Such a biomarker could be used to detect and better understand the mechanisms of toxic action and inter/intra-species susceptibility to radiation within an environmental risk assessment and management context.",Composition and endocrine effects of water collected in the Kibale national park in Uganda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103006,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Pesticides are used worldwide with potential harmful effects on both fauna and flora.

To further investigate the water pollution linked to agricultural pressure in this protected area, we implemented a complementary monitoring strategy based on: analytical chemistry, effects based methods and the deployment of Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS). Chemical analysis of the POCIS extracts revealed the presence of 13 pesticides: carbofuran, DEET, 2.4-D amine, carbaryl, ametryn, isoproturon, metolachlor, terbutryn, dimethoate, imidacloprid, picaridin, thiamethoxam, carbendazim, with the first three being present in the largest quantities.

In terrestrial environments, microfibres (MFs) generated from textile laundering are believed to form a significant component of MPs entering soils, mainly through sewage sludge and compost applications. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of MFs on a keystone soil organism. We exposed the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris to soil with polyester MFs incorporated at rates of 0, 0.1 and 1.0 %w/w MF for a period of 35 days (in the dark at 15 °C; n = 4 for each treatment). Dried plant litter was applied at the soil surface as a food source for the earthworms. We assessed earthworm vitality through mortality, weight change, depurate production and MF avoidance testing. In addition, we measured stress biomarker responses via the expression of metallothionein-2 (mt-2), heat shock protein (hsp70) and superoxide dismutase (sod-1). Our results showed that exposure and ingestion of MFs (as evidenced by subsequent retrieval of MFs within earthworm depurates) were not lethal to earthworms, nor did earthworms actively avoid MFs. However, earthworms in the MF1.0% treatment showed a 1.5-fold lower cast production, a 24.3-fold increase in expression of mt-2 (p < 0.001) and a 9.9-fold decline in hsp70 expression (p < 0.001). Further analysis of soil and MF samples indicated that metal content was not a contributor to the biomarker results. Given that burrowing and feeding behaviour, as well as molecular genetic biomarkers, were modulated in earthworms exposed to MFs, our study highlights potential implications for soil ecosystem processes due to MF contamination.","Chemical characteristics, sources, and formation mechanisms of PM2.5 before and during the Spring Festival in a coastal city in Southeast China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103004,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Severe pollution caused by atmospheric particulate matter (PM) has become a global environmental issue.

The results indicated that PM2.5 mass concentrations comprised 53.60% and 56.31% of total suspended particulates before and during the Spring Festival, respectively. Due to the halt of factory production and construction and the reduction of vehicle flow during the Spring Festival, the concentrations of organic carbon, elemental carbon and water soluble ions in PM2.5 decreased by 78.56%, 84.19% and 27.53%, respectively, compared with those before the Spring Festival. However, the concentrations of K+, Mg2+, Al, Sr, and Ba increased by 3121.76%, 571.67%, 183.71%, 180.15%, and 137.58%, respectively, resulting from the display of fireworks and firecrackers during the Spring Festival. Analysis of backward air mass trajectory indicated that the concentrations of PM2.5 and its components were dominated by local pollution sources before and during the Spring Festival. The relationships between meteorological conditions and pollutant concentrations showed that the secondary organic aerosol was generated from the heterogeneous reaction before the Spring Festival, and the secondary inorganic aerosol was formed by the photochemical reaction during the Spring Festival.",Mediated food and hydrodynamics on the ingestion of microplastics by Daphnia magna.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103003,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"There is consensus on the need to study the potential impact microplastics (MP) have on freshwater planktonic organisms. It is not yet fully understood how MP enter the aquatic food web or the effect they have on all the trophic levels. As a result of the potential for MP to accumulate throughout food webs, there is increasing interest in evaluating their fate in a variety of environmental conditions. This study investigated the variability in the ingestion of MP to food ratios and the exposed time of MP to Daphnia magna in non-sheared and sheared conditions. The sheared environment provided Daphnia magna with the conditions for optimal filtering capacity. Regardless of the ratios of MP concentration to food concentration (MP:Food), the filtration capacity of the Daphnia magna was enhanced in the sheared experiments. In both the sheared and non-sheared experiments, filtration capacity decreased when the ratios of MP to food concentration and the exposure times to MP were increased. Mortality was mainly enhanced in the non-sheared conditions at higher MP concentrations and exposure times to MP. No mortality was found in the sheared conditions for the exposure times studied. Therefore, in aquatic systems that undergo constant low sheared conditions, Daphnia magna can survive longer when exposed to MP than in calm conditions, provided food concentrations do not limit their capacity to filter.",Effect of solution chemistry and aggregation on adsorption of perfluorooctanesulphonate (PFOS) to nano-sized alumina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103002,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"The interaction of pollutants with nanomaterials has attracted attention due to the extensive application of nanomaterials.

In this study, we developed a method of examining, screening and applying online data from the country's improving continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) to reevaluate a ""bottom-up"" emission inventory of China's coal-fired power sector. The benefits of China's current national emission standards and ultra-low emission policy for the sector were quantified assuming their full implementation. The derived national average emission factors of SO2, NOx and particulate matter (PM) were 1.00, 1.00 and 0.25 kg/t-coal respectively for 2015 based on CEMS data, smaller than those of previous studies that may not fully recognize improved emission controls in recent years. The annual emissions of SO2, NOx and PM from the sector were recalculated at 1321, 1430 and 334 Gg respectively, 75%, 63% and 76% smaller than our estimates based on a previous approach without the benefit of CEMS data. The results imply that online measurement with proper data screening can better track the recent progress of emission controls. The emission intensity (the ratio of emissions to economic output) of Northwest China was larger than that of other regions, attributed mainly to its less intensive economy and industry. Transmission of electricity to more-developed eastern provinces raised the energy consumption and emissions of less-developed regions. Judged by 95 percentiles of flue-gas concentrations measured by CEMS, most power plants met the current national emission standards in 2015 except for those in Northwest and Northeast China, while plants that met the ultra-low emission policy were much scarcer. National SO2, NOx and PM emissions would further decline by 68%, 55% and 81% respectively if the ultra-low emission policy can be strictly implemented, implying the great potential of the policy for emission abatement.",Analytical investigations on Boswellia occulta essential oils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102998,Phytochemistry,2019 06 13,"Three samples of Boswellia occulta gum resin (Grades I, II and III) were analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID.

Neurotrophic factor (NTF) producing cells encapsulated in an alginate-matrix, to shield them from the host immune system and to avoid migration, and applied as viscose solution or electrode coating could address this requirement. Both application methods were tested for their feasibility in an artificial human cochlea model. Since both strategies potentially influence the electrode implantability, insertion forces and coating stability were analyzed on custom-made electrode arrays. Both, injection of the alginate-cell solution into the model and a manual dip coating of electrode arrays with subsequent insertion into the model were possible. The insertion forces of coated arrays were reduced by 75% of an uncoated reference. In contrast, filling of the model with non-crosslinked alginate-cell solution slightly increased the insertion forces. A good stability of the coating was observed after first insertion (85%) but abrasion increased after multiple insertions (50%). Both application strategies are possible options for cell-induced drug-delivery to the inner ear, but an alginate-cell coating of CI-electrodes has a great potential to combine an endogenous NTF-source with a strong reduction of insertion forces.",In vivo stress relaxation of human scalp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102983,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 11,Conduct a first in vivo study on the large deformation stress relaxation behavior of the human scalp.,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102982,Journal of contaminant hydrology,2019 05 18,"The dual-porosity structure of peat and the extremely high organic matter content give rise to a complex medium that typically generates prolonged tailing and early 50% concentration breakthrough in the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of chloride (Cl-) and other anions. Untangling whether these observations are due to rate-limited (physical) diffusion into inactive pores, (chemical) adsorption or anion exclusion remains a critical question in peat hydrogeochemistry. This study aimed to elucidate whether Cl- is truly conservative in peat, as usually assumed, and whether the prolonged tailing and early 50% concentration breakthrough of Cl- observed is due to diffusion, adsorption, anion exclusion or a combination of all three. The mobile-immobile (MiM) dual-porosity model was fit to BTCs of Cl- and deuterated water measured on undisturbed cores of the same peat soils, and equilibrium Cl- adsorption batch experiments were conducted. Adsorption of Cl- to undecomposed and decomposed peat samples in batch experiments followed Freundlich isotherms but did not exhibit any trends with the degree of peat decomposition and sorption became negligible below aqueous Cl- concentrations of ~310 mg L-1. The dispersivity determined by fitting the Cl- BTCs whether assuming adsorption or no adsorption were significantly different than determined by the deuterated water (p < .0001). However, no statistical differences in dispersivity (p = .27) or immobile water content (p = .97) was observed between deuterated water and Cl- when accounting for anion exclusion. A higher degree of decomposition significantly increased anion exclusion (p < .0001) but did not influence the diffusion of either tracer into the immobile porosity. Contrary to previous assumptions, Cl- is not truly conservative in peat due to anion exclusion, and adsorption at higher aqueous concentrations, but the overall effect of anion exclusion on transport is likely minimal.",Sorption properties and behaviour at laboratory scale of selected pharmaceuticals using batch experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102981,Journal of contaminant hydrology,2019 06 12,"Despite the increasing public concern about the frequent occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the water bodies, their transport and fate are not yet well known; in particular in groundwater. In this laboratory study, batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption behaviour of selected pharmaceuticals. The choice of compounds was motivated by their chemical properties as well as by their occurrence at the relevant field sites. It included: antipyrine, atenolol, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, diclofenac, ketoprofen, ofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole. Sorption behaviour has already been investigated for some of these compounds (e.g. carbamazepine), but for the others (e.g. antipyrine, ketoprofen), extensive studies are missing so far. For the experiments, artificial and actual aquifer materials from complementary field sites were selected: technical coarse quartz sand and sediments from alluvial Vistrenque Aquifer, France (sandy loam), and fluvio-deltaic Baix Fluvià Aquifer, Spain (sandy clay loam, clay, and medium sand). In these field sites occurrence of pharmaceuticals in groundwater was previously stated, and the presented laboratory experiments were complementary to the field investigations. Five concentration steps for determining the sorption isotherms were investigated. Correlation analysis showed dependencies of K-coefficients of individual compounds and sediment properties; however, no clear, universal patterns for all compounds were found. Batch experiments suggest that sorption behaviour was governed by compound-specific properties rather than by sediment properties. These results contribute to the understanding sorption behaviour of pharmaceuticals in heterogeneous sediments, although some inconsistencies were revealed between laboratory scale results and field scale observations.",Charging the code - tRNA modification complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102979,Current opinion in structural biology,2019 06 11,"All types of cellular RNAs are post-transcriptionally modified, constituting the so called 'epitranscriptome'. In particular, tRNAs and their anticodon stem loops represent major modification hotspots. The attachment of small chemical groups at the heart of the ribosomal decoding machinery can directly affect translational rates, reading frame maintenance, co-translational folding dynamics and overall proteome stability. The variety of tRNA modification patterns is driven by the activity of specialized tRNA modifiers and large modification complexes. Notably, the absence or dysfunction of these cellular machines is correlated with several human pathophysiologies. In this review, we aim to highlight the most recent scientific progress and summarize currently available structural information of the most prominent eukaryotic tRNA modifiers.",Biology of multiciliated cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102978,Current opinion in genetics & development,2019 06 13,"Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are specialized in fluid propulsion through directional beating of myriads of superficial motile cilia, which rest on modified centrioles named basal bodies. MCCs are found throughout metazoans, and serve functions as diverse as feeding and locomotion in marine organisms, as well as mucus clearance, cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and egg transportation in mammals. Impaired MCC differentiation or activity causes diseases characterized by severe chronic airway infections and reduced fertility. Through studies in Xenopus and mouse mainly, MCC biology has made significant progress on several fronts in recent years. The gene regulatory network that controls MCC specification and differentiation has been deciphered to a large extent. The enigmatic deuterosomes, which serve as centriole amplification platforms in vertebrate MCCs, have started to be studied at the molecular level. Principles of ciliary beating coordination within and between MCCs have been identified.",Understanding facial impressions between and within identities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102977,Cognition,2019 06 14,"A paradoxical finding from recent studies of face perception is that observers are error-prone and inconsistent when judging the identity of unfamiliar faces, but nevertheless reasonably consistent when judging traits. Our aim is to understand this difference. Using everyday ambient images of faces, we show that visual image statistics can predict observers' consensual impressions of trustworthiness, attractiveness and dominance, which represent key dimensions of evaluation in leading theoretical accounts of trait judgement. In Study 1, image statistics derived from ambient images of multiple face identities were able to account for 51% of the variance in consensual impressions of entirely novel ambient images. Shape properties were more effective predictors than surface properties, but a combination of both achieved the best results. In Study 2 and Study 3, statistics derived from multiple images of a particular face achieved the best generalisation to new images of that face, but there was nonetheless significant generalisation between images of the faces of different individuals. Hence, whereas idiosyncratic variability across different images of the same face is sufficient to cause substantial problems in judging the identities of unfamiliar faces, there are consistencies between faces which are sufficient to support (to some extent) consensual trait judgements. Furthermore, much of this consistency can be captured in simple operational models based on image statistics.",Brain volumetric correlates of dysarthria in multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102976,Brain and language,2019 06 07,"Although dysarthria is a common pattern in multiple sclerosis (MS), the contribution of specific brain areas to key factors of dysarthria remains unknown.

Results of computerized acoustic analyses of subtests on spastic and ataxic aspects of dysarthria were correlated with MRI-based brain volume measurements. Slow articulation rate during reading was associated with bilateral white and grey matter loss whereas reduced maximum speed during oral diadochokinesis was related to greater cerebellar involvement. Articulation rate showed similar correlation to whole brain atrophy (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) as the standard clinical scales such as EDSS (r = -0.45, p < 0.001).

Molecular phylogenies place them as a poorly resolved, likely paraphyletic assemblage outside the Spirocuta clade of flexible euglenids, which includes the well-known phototrophs and primary osmotrophs. Here, we report SSU rRNA gene sequences from 38 ploeotids, using both single-cell and culture-based methods. Several contain group I or non-canonical introns. Our phylogenetic analyses place ploeotids in 8 distinct clades: Olkasia n. gen., Hemiolia n. gen., Liburna n. gen., Lentomonas, Decastava, Keelungia, Ploeotiidae, and Entosiphon. Ploeotia vitrea, the type of Ploeotia, is closely related to P. oblonga and Serpenomonas costata, but not to Lentomonas. Ploeotia cf. vitrea sensu Lax and Simpson 2013 is not related to P. vitrea and has a different pellicle strip architecture (as imaged by scanning electron microscopy): it instead represents a novel genus and species, Olkasia polycarbonata. We also describe new genera, Hemiolia and Liburna, for the morphospecies Anisonema trepidum and A. glaciale. A recent system proposing 13 suprafamilial taxa that include ploeotids is not supported by our phylogenies. The exact relationships between ploeotid groups remain unresolved and multigene phylogenetics or phylogenomics are needed to address this uncertainty."

Due to the low sugar, ethanol and glycerol production is limited during fermentation affecting important sensory aspects such as the palate fullness of these beverages. The high acidity influences their organoleptic quality, as well. So far, only S. cerevisiae starter, used in conventional fermentations, have been tested in this condition, and no selection has been performed to identify alternative yeasts suitable for unripe grape fermentation. S. bacillaris is known for the low ethanol tolerance, high glycerol and moderate volatile acidity production. Therefore, this non- Saccharomyces yeast have been investigated to improve the quality of low-alcohol beverages. Seven S. bacillaris strains were tested in synthetic musts with different sugar and malic acid levels, mimicking natural ripe and unripe grape musts. In all the tested conditions, S. bacillaris produced higher glycerol than S. cerevisiae. In single-strain fermentation at low sugar and high malic acid no S. bacillaris strains was able to transform all the sugars, although the produced ethanol was lower than that at high sugar condition. Therefore, sequential fermentations with S. cerevisiae were evaluated at low sugar and high malic acid. In this condition all the sugars were consumed and a significant glycerol increase was found. These results were confirmed when sequential fermentations were run in natural unripe grape must. Moreover, an increase in malic acid degradation, with respect to EC1118 single-strain fermentation, was observed.",No increased cerebrovascular involvement in adult beta-thalassemia by advanced MRI analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102961,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",2019 05 21,"Beta-thalassemia-related anemia and chronic hypercoagulative state are supposed to cause cumulative cerebrovascular damage with consequent parenchymal/vascular changes and functional impairment. However, recent conventional MRI/MR-angiography investigations failed to show an increased cerebrovascular involvement in beta-thalassemia patients managed according to current treatment guidelines, in spite of significantly decreased full-scale IQ scores. We therefore investigated those patients and controls by means of advanced quantitative MRI analyses (based on magnetization transfer and diffusion tensor imaging) searching for signs of possible cerebrovascular injuries undetected by conventional MRI/MR-angiography. The 3 T-MRI study protocol included diffusion tensor imaging and 3D-multi-echo FLASH sequences for magnetization transfer analysis. Whole-brain voxel-based analyses showed that magnetization transfer, fractional anisotropy, and mean, radial and axial diffusivity do not differ between healthy controls and beta-thalassemia patients (considered as a whole group or as distinct transfusion dependent and non-transfusion dependent subgroups). No correlation emerged between all the considered MRI metrics and cognitive findings (full-scale IQ) or the main clinical and laboratory data. According to our findings, adult neurologically-asymptomatic beta-thalassemia patients (regardless of clinical severity) do not seem to present an increased disease-related cerebrovascular vulnerability compared to healthy controls downsizing the need of regular brain MRI monitoring, at least when the current treatment guidelines are followed.",An fMRI study of action observation and action execution in childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102960,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Although many studies have examined the location and function of the mirror neuron system (MNS) in human adults, we know relatively little about its development. The current study fills this gap by using fMRI to examine for the first time the development of the brain regions implicated in action execution, action observation, and their overlap. We examined age-related differences in brain activation by contrasting a group of children (n = 21) and adults (n = 18). Surfaced-based analyses of action execution and action observation revealed that brain activity for action observation and execution in children is similar to adults, though adults displayed greater activity than children within the right superior parietal lobe during action execution and the occipital lobe during action observation compared to control. Further, within-individual measures of overlapping activation between action observation and execution revealed age-related differences, such that adults, compared to children, displayed more spatial overlap. Moreover, the extent of the overlap in activation across conditions was related to better motor skills and action representation abilities in children. These data indicate that the MNS changes between middle childhood and adulthood. The data also demonstrate the functional significance of the putative MNS to motor skills and action representation during development.",The neural association between arithmetic and basic numerical processing depends on arithmetic problem size and not chronological age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102959,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 05 28,"The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is thought to be an important region for basic number processing (e.g. symbol-quantity associations) and arithmetic (e.g. addition). Evidence for shared circuitry within the IPS is largely based on comparisons across studies, and little research has investigated number processing and arithmetic in the same individuals. It is also unclear how the neural overlap between number processing and arithmetic is influenced by age and arithmetic problem difficulty. This study investigated these unresolved questions by examining basic number processing (symbol-quantity matching) and arithmetic (addition) networks in 26 adults and 42 children. Number processing and arithmetic elicited overlapping activity in the IPS in children and adults, however, the overlap was influenced by arithmetic problem size (i.e. which modulated the need to use procedural strategies). The IPS was recruited for number processing, and for arithmetic problems more likely to be solved using procedural strategies. We also found that the overlap between number processing and small-problem addition in children was comparable to the overlap between number processing and large-problem addition in adults. This finding suggests that the association between number processing and arithmetic in the IPS is related to the cognitive operation being performed rather than age.",Flavonoids in hypertension: a brief review of the underlying mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102958,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 06 10,"Flavonoids are a diverse group of bioactive polyphenolic compounds abundant in dietary plants and herbs. Regular consumption of flavonoids exerts cardio-vasculoprotective effects and may reduce the onset or progression of many cardiovascular diseases, particularly hypertension. Observational studies suggest inverse associations among either of these three combinations: a) anthocyanin intake and risk of myocardial infarction (MI), b) flavanone intake and risk of ischemic stroke and c) flavonol intake and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that catechins and quercetin impart significant blood pressure lowering effects. Mechanistically, flavonoids mediate their antihypertensive effects through increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, reducing endothelial cell oxidative stress or modulating vascular ion channel activity. In this review, we focus on the six main subgroups of flavonoids, namely flavones, flavonols, flavanols, flavanones, anthocyanins, and isoflavones. We further discuss their antihypertensive effects, and their possible mechanisms of regulating blood pressure.

Surface characteristics of carbon samples were studied by N2 adsorption, Boehm titration, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), respectively. The predominant mechanism of Hg0 removal was the formation of chemical bonds between Hg and various functional groups. Both XPS and XAFS analysis revealed that mercury bound on carbon surface was mainly in oxidation state. Under N2 atmosphere, the absorbed Hg was found as Hg2+, and coordinated to O atom. With the existence of HCl in simulated flue gas, Hg0 was bonded on Cl sites and HgCl2 was assumed to be the dominated form."

HLA complex P5 (HCP5), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been shown to be implicated in several types of cancer, such as follicular thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the main type of thyroid cancer. However, the role of HCP5 in ATC remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of HCP5 in ATC and its potential roles. The expression levels of HCP5 and microRNA (miR)-128-3p were tested using qRT-PCR. MTT assay was performed to detect cell viability. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by detecting apoptotic rate and caspase-3/7 activity. Luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were carried out to confirm the association between HCP5 and miR-128-3p. Compared with human thyroid follicular cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 cells, HCP5 expression level was significantly increased in ATC cell lines. Besides, HCP5 expression level was increased in ATC tissues when compared with adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of HCP5 reduced cell viability, while elevated apoptotic rate and caspase-3/7 activity in ARO and SW1736 cells. MiR-128-3p was predicted to be a target gene of HCP5. The expression level of miR-128-3p was significantly decreased in ATC cells and tissues, as compared to Nthy-ori 3-1 cells and adjacent normal tissues, respectively. MiR-128-3p overexpression reduced ATC cell viability, and induced cell apoptosis. HCP5 directly bound to miR-128-3p and regulated the expression of miR-128-3p in ARO and SW1736 cells. Furthermore, the effects of HCP5 knockdown on ATC cell viability and apoptosis were attenuated by the inhibitor of miR-128-3p. These findings suggested that knockdown of HCP5 exerted anti-tumor effect via sponging miR-128-3p in ATC, which might provide a potential approach for the treatment of ATC.",Pharmacokinetics and cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin and its secondary alcohol metabolite in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102935,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 11,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic drug.

Compound 11e was demonstrated to have potent antiangiogenic activity. Further studies showed that 11e suppressed tumour growth in human breast cancer (MCF-7) xenograft models without obvious side effects. Evaluation of the mechanism revealed that 11e targeted the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in MCF-7 cells and inhibited HUVEC migration and then contributed to hindrance of angiogenesis.

Furthermore, up to the present time, less emphasis has been placed on describing the underlying mechanisms relating childhood experiences of family structure to health. In this paper, we hypothesize that socio-economic characteristics and family structure trajectories will affect every-day, more proximal processes (material, behavioural and family stress pathways) directly experienced by the child, which will in turn affect child health. Using the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative cohort of over 19 000 children born in 2001 and living in the UK shortly thereafter, we employ Graphical Chain Models to map the processes linking family structure trajectories to three physical health outcomes at age 5: overweight/obesity, respiratory health, and accidental injury. We construct family trajectories to highlight two components: status (distinguishing between married, cohabiting and single parents), and (in)stability. We show that both status, the (in)stability of that status, and their interplay, are important components of family structure trajectories which correlate to children's early physical health. Analyses highlight the relative importance of distinct pathways across different health outcomes. As well as some outcome-specific paths, we find that ""family stress"" variables appeared to underscore the relationship between family structure and child physical health, pointing to the importance of such variables in understanding how family structure relates to early child health.","Health financing in fragile and conflict-affected settings: What do we know, seven years on?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102931,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 06 11,"Over the last few years, there has been growing attention to health systems research in fragile and conflict-affected setting (FCAS) from both researchers and donors. In 2012, an exploratory literature review was conducted to analyse the main themes and findings of recent literature focusing on health financing in FCAS. Seven years later, this paper presents an update of that review, reflecting on what has changed in terms of the knowledge base, and what are the on-going gaps and new challenges in our understanding of health financing in FCAS. A total of 115 documents were reviewed following a purposeful, non-systematic search of grey and published literature. Data were analysed according to key health financing themes, ensuring comparability with the 2012 review. Bibliometric analysis suggests that the field has continued to grow, and is skewed towards countries with a large donor presence (such as Afghanistan). Aid coordination remains the largest single topic within the themes, likely reflecting the dominance of external players, not just substantively but also in relation to research. Many studies are commissioned by external agencies and in addition to concerns about independence of findings there is also likely a neglect of smaller, more home-grown reforms. In addition, we find that despite efforts to coordinate approaches across humanitarian and developmental settings, the literature remains distinct between them. We highlight research gaps, including empirical analysis of domestic and external financing trends across FCAS and non-FCAS over time, to understand better common health financing trajectories, what drives them and their implications. We highlight a dearth of evidence in relation to health financing goals and objectives for UHC (such as equity, efficiency, financial access), which is significant given the relevance of UHC, and the importance of the social and political values which different health financing arrangements can communicate, which also merit in-depth study.",Occupational variation in burnout among medical staff: Evidence for the stress of higher status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102930,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 06 16,"Contemporary research highlights the serious mental health issues facing physicians and allied health professionals. Yet to date, much of this research has focused on these occupational groups in isolation. Drawing upon data collected from medical staff in a neonatal intensive care unit (N = 222), we address this gap by contrasting the mental health and workplace experiences of four groups of healthcare workers: physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and respiratory therapists. We find evidence that higher status healthcare workers-physicians and nurse practitioners-are more likely than their colleagues to report work-life conflict, irregular work hours, and heavy work pressure. These stressors explain an appreciable amount of the higher levels of burnout found among physicians and nurse practitioners. Collectively, results lend support to ""the stress of higher status"" hypothesis and provide insights into the job demands and mental health issues confronted by today's medical workforce.",Topology of regulatory networks that guide plant meristem activity: similarities and differences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102928,Current opinion in plant biology,2019 05 29,"Plants adapt their morphology in response to variable environmental conditions such as nitrate availability, drought, and temperature shifts. Three crucial aspects to this developmental plasticity are the control of initiation, identity and activity of meristems. At the cellular level, the activity of meristems is controlled by balancing self-renewal in stem cells, amplifying divisions in their daughter cells, and cell differentiation. Recent studies in plants have uncovered transcription factors regulating meristem activity at cellular resolution, and regulatory networks that couple these factors with phytohormone signalling for global plant growth regulation. Here, we highlight selected recent advances in our understanding of the multidimensional transcriptional networks that regulate meristem activity and discuss emerging insights on how a selection of environmental cues impinges on these networks.",Vestibular rehabilitation in older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment: Effects of virtual reality using a head-mounted display.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102927,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2019 06 01,"Due to the gap in the knowledge in the field of vestibular rehabilitation the purpose of this randomized study is to highlight the outcomes of head-mounted display (HMD) implementation in older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), suffering from unilateral vestibular hypofunction (UVH).","Gender differences in health status, quality of life, and community service needs of older adults living alone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102926,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2019 06 01,"The aim of this study was to identify gender differences in the health status, community service needs, and quality of life of older adults living alone in an urban city in South Korea."

Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is known to improve endothelial function in diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesized that sEH inhibitor (sEHI), [trans-4-{4-[3-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)-ureido]cyclohexyloxy}benzoic acid] / t-TUCB can restore the male sexual function in diabetic rat. After one week of administration of diabetogenic agent STZ (52 mg/kg i.p) injection, diabetic rats were treated with t-TUCB (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, p.o) or vehicle for 8 weeks. The sexual behaviour parameters of the animals were evaluated at the end of dosing period. The levels of testosterone and glucose in serum, and sperm were quantified. Effect of treatment on weight of reproductive organs and histopathology of penile tissue was evaluated. Diabetes had a negative effect on male sexual function, weight of sexual organs and production of sperm with a parallel decrease in the level of testosterone. The sEHI, t-TUCB, significantly preserved the sexual function and minimized an increase in the level of blood glucose in diabetic rats. It also prevented a decrease in the level of testosterone and sperm in diabetic rats, in comparison to diabetic control rats. Further, diabetes induced distortion of corpus cavernosum was attenuated by t-TUCB. Based on our findings, sEHI may delay the development of sexual dysfunction in diabetes.",Mesenchymal stem cell derived EVs mediate neuroprotection after spinal cord injury in rats via the microRNA-21-5p/FasL gene axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102912,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a relatively common type of motor system trauma. While the SCI patient will experience varying degrees of paraplegia and quadriplegia, which severely affects their quality of life, a heavy burden is also placed on the family and society as a whole. The exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying this condition remain unknown and no specific treatments are currently available. Findings from recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), derived from extracellular vesicles (EVs) can reduce apoptosis, inflammation and promote angiogenesis after SCI. However, the mechanisms through which EVs exert these effects have yet to be identified, indicating the necessity for further investigation. In the present study, we report that treatment with MSCs-EVs significantly improved functional recovery and attenuated lesion size and apoptosis in a rat model of SCI. These MSCs-EVs were found to be directed to the spinal injury site and mainly incorporated into neurons within the lesioned site of the spinal cord. Tandem Mass Tags quantitative proteomics was applied to compare protein changes after SCI and MSCs-EVs treatment. A total of 883 differential proteins were identified, many of which being associated with apoptosis and inflammation. Subsequently, miRNA contents of MSCs-EVs were determined using qRT-PCR, with the result that miR-21-5p was one of the most highly expressed miRNA in these MSCs-EVs. Moreover, inhibition of miR-21-5p in MSCs-EVs significantly reversed the beneficial effects of MSCs-EVs on motor function and apoptosis, an effect which was associated with modulating FasL expression. The data suggest that modulation of the MSCs-EVs miR-21-5p/FasL gene axis may serve as a promising strategy for clinical treatment of SCI and other neurological diseases.",The anxiolytic-like effects of puerarin on an animal model of PTSD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102911,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental illness that affected numerous people. The anti-PTSD-like effects of puerarin is unknown, although the antidepressant- and anxiolytic- like effects of puerarin have been reported. The PTSD behavioral deficits in rats were induced by single prolonged stress (SPS), mainly including the reduced time/entries in the open arms and the elevated time/entries in the closed arms in elevated plus maze test, increased freezing duration in contextual fear paradigm and lowered time/entries in the central zone in open field test. However, the behavioral deficits were attenuated by puerarin (50 and 100 mg/kg) without affecting the locomotor activity. For the evaluation of mechanism, the decreased levels of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and the increased levels of corticosterone, corticotropin releasing hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone in the brain or serum were induced by SPS, which is blocked by puerarin. In summary, the anti-PTSD-like effects of puerarin were associated with biosynthesis of neurosteroids and normalized levels of stress hormones in HPA axis.",Sini decoction ameliorates sepsis-induced acute lung injury via regulating ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis and inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102910,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Sepsis, as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is characterized by the extensive release of cytokines and other mediators. Sini decoction (SND), a traditional Chinese prescription medicine, has been used clinically for the treatment of sepsis. But its explicit mechanism of action is still unclear. The present study aims to evaluate the potential protective effects of SND on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). After SND intervention, the lung tissues of each experimental group were collected. H&E sections were used to observe the pathological changes of lung tissue, and alveolar lavage fluid was collected to detect the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Level of inflammatory factors in lung tissue were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The change of Renin angiotensin system (RAS), as well as downstream MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways were measured by Western blot. For in vitro experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with SND. Subsequently, the expression levels of RAS and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways were measured by Western blot. In vivo, we found that SND significantly attenuated sepsis-induced pathological injury in the lung. SND also inhibited LPS-mediated inflammatory cell infiltration, the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and the production of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1. In vitro, experiments using a co-culture of HUVECs with SND showed that there was a decrease in pro-apoptotic protein and pro-inflammatory mediator. In this research, we also found that SND protective action could be attributed to the regulation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS). MAPKs and NF-κB pathways. To conclude, our study demonstrated that SND ameliorates sepsis-induced-ALI via regulating ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas axis and inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway.",Chronic sarcoid myopathy mimicking sporadic inclusion body myositis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102909,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 06 05,"The patient was an 81-year-old woman. At age 73, she developed difficulties in climbing stairs and swallowing, and became unable to open bottles at age 74. She had been walking with a cane since age 76. Accidental chest X-ray findings showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy at age 78. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was elevated. Lymphocyte proliferation was prominent in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Sarcoidosis was suspected, but she was followed without treatment due to lack of respiratory symptoms. She became unable to walk without assistance at age 80 and visited our hospital with a complaint of gait disturbance at age 81. Moderate diffuse muscle atrophy in extremities was evident. Muscle weakness of finger flexion and knee extension were remarkable. The muscle involvement pattern was similar to sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM). However, radiographically, rectus femoris and semitendinosus muscles are selectively preserved. This radiogaphic finding was consistent with chronic sarcoid myopathy (CSM). We reached a final diagnosis of CSM based on the presence of granulomas in the muscle biopsy specimen, BHL in fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography, the previous finding of elevated ACE, and bronchoscopy results. In conclusion, CSM is a treatable disease and should thus be differentiated from sIBM. This should not be done solely based on clinical findings, but instead, muscle biopsy should be performed. Moreover, muscle selectivity may be useful in distinguishing between CSM and sIBM.",The LACE+ index fails to predict 30-90 day readmission for supratentorial craniotomy patients: A retrospective series of 238 surgical procedures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102908,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 06 05,"The LACE + index (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, and Emergency department visits in the past 6 months) is a tool utilized to predict 30-90 day readmission and other secondary outcomes.

However, uncertainties, associated with the long-term release of C-14 from graphite and the evolution in the post-closure environment of a geological disposal facility (GDF), exist. In this paper, an integrated modelling framework has been developed to investigate these uncertainties. The modelling framework consists of a biogeochemical near field model which interfaces with a geosphere/biosphere model and it is verified by comparing the results to those obtained from other models. A sensitivity analysis discloses that a faster mid chain scission rate of stopped cellulose about four orders of magnitude assesses a twice higher effective dose. In another scenario, which is related to the control of microbial activity by pH and the availability of carbon dioxide to microbes, the effective dose is two orders of magnitude higher compared with a reference scenario. This modelling work illustrates also the importance of far field parameters, such as the rock permeability and the release area of gas pathway, to the assessment of effective dose.",Testing of the radon tightness of beakers and different types of sealing used in gamma-ray spectrometry for 226Ra concentration determination in NORM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102906,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 05 31,"The presence of radium is common in the natural environment. However, some human activities lead to the production of large amounts of waste and by-product containing elevated concentrations of radium. Several methods for the determination of radium isotopes exist. The common use of gamma-ray spectrometry is justified by several of its advantages: it is a non-destructive method, easy, it is a time- and cost-effective procedure of preparing a sample and provides a reasonable time of measurement. The major disadvantages of direct measurements of radium are its weak yields γ-line 186.2 keV (3.59%) and, additionally, an interference with 235U direct line 185.7 keV. There is an indirect method of measuring radium. The method uses the daughter radionuclides of radon: 214Pb and 214Bi. The problem is radon escape from the measurement container. The article describes the tests of radontightness of various types of containers and different types of sealing. In frame of performed measurements, not sufficient tightness of typical containers used in laboratories was found.",Uncertainties and characteristic limits of counting and spectrometric dosimetry systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102905,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 05 31,"In the event of a radiological emergency, early and reliable knowledge of radioactivity concentrations is important information for organising countermeasures to protect the general public and emergency workers. This is ensured by all European countries in operating airborne radioactivity and dose rate early warning networks. To increase the provided information, the development of new secondary standards based on scintillation detectors for the measurement of ambient dose rate equivalent was initiated in 2014. This paper shows the state-of-the-art of uncertainties and characteristic limits of low dose rate measurement that can be achieved by scintillation-based detector (CeBr3) and gas-based detectors (a high-pressure ionization chamber, HPIC). The comparison of the devices shows the performance and the metrological potential of the CeBr3 detector: Its uncertainty is already very close to the uncertainty of reference values. Looking at the question how to select a reference instrument, the CeBr3 detector with a special data evaluation is even superior to the HPIC and qualifies therefore as a modern secondary standard: Providing both, dose rate and nuclide information.","Benthic quality assessment using M-AMBI in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102904,Marine environmental research,2019 06 10,"Benthic invertebrates that inhabit the seafloor respond to anthropogenic and natural stresses, and are good indicators for assessing the benthic ecological status. We evaluated the ecosystem health of the Seto Inland Sea based on the multivariate AZTI Marine Biotic Index (M-AMBI), being its first application in a Japanese coastal sea with numerous endemic species. From the 415 locations studied, we were able to use M-AMBI in 384 sites (92.5% in all sites). The result revealed a statistically significant correlation among biotic indices including AMBI, M-AMBI, Richness, and H' (p < 0.01). Most of the physico-chemical parameters of the sediment (water content, total organic carbon (TOC) content, sulfide content, mud content, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)) were significantly correlated with each other excluding sediment temperature. The M-AMBI was significantly correlated with physico-chemical variables including water content, TOC content, sulfide content, and ORP. We found that the sites classified into the organically enriched cluster, and having high contents of TOC, mud, and sulfide and negative ORP, corresponded with sites that had significantly low M-AMBI values (bad-poor ecological status). Conversely, sites in the unpolluted sandy cluster were assigned high M-AMBI values (high-good ecological status). Therefore, M-AMBI would be a useful biotic index in Japanese coasts due to the representation of the comprehensive sediment quality."

Depressed adolescents with high suicide ideation, including attempters (n = 45;HS) or low suicide ideation (n = 42;LS), and healthy adolescents (n = 39;HC), completed a version of the Cyberball peer interaction task during an fMRI scan. Groups were compared on brain activity during peer exclusion and inclusion versus a non-social condition. During peer exclusion and inclusion, HS youth showed significantly lower activity in precentral and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen compared to LS youth; and significantly reduced activity in caudate and anterior cingulate cortex compared to HC youth. In a second analysis, suicide attempters (n = 26;SA) were compared to other groups. SA adolescents showed significantly higher activity in ACC and superior and middle frontal gyrus than all other groups.

Beside core symptomatology, ASD people are frequently affected by psychiatric comorbidities and behavioral problems. To date, only risperidone and aripiprazole have been approved for the pharmacological treatment of ASD-associated irritability in children and adolescents, while no guidelines exist for adults. The present cross-sectional study examined the prevalence and predictors of psychotropic medication use in 195 autistic subjects, aged between 14 and 58, treated in two Italian tertiary care centers. 58.5% of the sample were taking at least one medication; one third of the sample were on polypharmacotherapy. Antipsychotics were prescribed to 40% of the sample. Nearly 30% of the sample were on anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers. Both antidepressants and benzodiazepines were prescribed to approximately 16% of the subjects. IQ, epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities were regarded as independent predictors of both mono- and polypharmacotherapy, while severity of repetitive behaviors predicted only polypharmacotherapy. Our data highlighted that medications prescribed to adolescents and adults with ASD are heterogeneous and often rely only on clinicians' experience.

Lifetime prevalence rates for NSSI and SA are 17% and 20% respectively, with half (55%) of self-injurers reporting a SA history. Bivariate analyses show that NSSI and SA are significantly related to one another, and many risk factors are common to both. Multivariate analysis comparing prisoners who engaged in NSSI with (n = 109) and without (n = 90) co-occurring SA indicates that suicidal ideation is the strongest independent correlate of SA among self-injurers. Additionally, relative to those with a history of NSSI only, prisoners with co-occurring NSSI and SA are significantly more likely to be violent offenders, being prescribed psychotropic medication, and report a psychiatric diagnosis; suggesting that they constitute a more clinically severe subgroup. Collectively, these findings highlight the marked overlap between NSSI and SA in prisoners, both in terms of prevalence and correlates, with suicidal ideation being an important predictor of suicide risk among self-injurers.",Emotion-related cerebral blood flow changes in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex: An NIRS study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102883,Brain and cognition,2019 06 09,"The current study examined whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the anterior ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) represent responses to emotional stimuli instead of cognitive control of emotion during distraction tasks, as suggested by our previous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study. The functional distinction of MPFC regions is occasionally difficult due to their multiple functions. Here, we addressed some remaining concerns from our previous distraction studies, and employed the distraction paradigm, in which negative or neutral images are presented as emotional stimuli; a rest period is included in one condition and working memory (distraction) tasks in the other. To extract the components of CBF changes associated with responses to negative emotional stimuli (defined as emotion-related CBF changes), we subtracted the CBF changes obtained in the neutral condition from those in the negative condition. We found that emotion-related CBF changes in the anterior left VMPFC were significantly greater in the rest condition than in the distraction task condition. These findings imply that the distraction task decreased unnecessary brain activities, resulting in decrease in the emotion-related CBF changes. They support our previous findings, indicating that CBF changes in anterior VMPFC regions, measured using NIRS, are specifically associated with responses to emotional stimuli."

To understand the possible reasons for the persistence of these pollution ""hotspots"", we investigated the case of the Kraków region (S Poland) known for its heavy pollution caused by a large steelworks. In 1975, at the apogee of industrial emissions, atmospheric deposition of trace metals was evaluated in this area using moss Pleurozium schreberi as a biomonitor. The survey was repeated in 1992, 1998 and 2014. The collected data showed that air quality improved significantly over 40 years: the amount of Cd, Pb, Fe, Cu and Zn accumulated by mosses decreased by a factor of 10, 9, 3.5, 2 and 2, respectively. The downward trend continued for most metals throughout the study period, although the biggest changes occurred at the very beginning (1975-1992). This improvement was mostly due to drops in industrial production and the introduction of environmentally friendly technologies. At the end of the study (1998-2014), clear increases in the concentrations of some trace metals in moss were observed (overall or at some locations). Spatiotemporal variability of moss elemental composition suggests that this is the result of the recent emergence of new (non-industrial) sources of metal pollution, associated with the urban sprawl and intensification of agriculture. Since this process is unlikely to stop in the near future, air quality will deteriorate rather than improve.",Probing the effects of different lead compounds on the bioavailability of lead to plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102868,Chemosphere,2019 06 02,"Lead (Pb) is an important pollutant and is released into the environment in many forms. Different lead compounds have a variety of solubilities and so may impact on lead bioavailability and toxicity when added to soil. In this experimental study, we investigated the bioavailability of Pb in soil spiked with 300, 900 and 1500 mg/kg of Pb-acetate, PbCl2 and PbO using lettuce and wallaby grass. The concentration of Pb in the shoots of both species from control soils (2-3 mg/kg) was similar to previously reported concentrations in plants grown on uncontaminated soils. The Pb concentrations in the plant shoots increased with Pb concentrations in soil for lettuce (R2 = 0.526, P < 0.001) and wallaby grass (R2 = 0.776, P < 0.001). This study demonstrated that Pb bioavailability in soil was not affected by the type of Pb compound added to the soil for both plant species up to 1500 mg/kg Pb concentrations. Instead, the Pb concentration in the plant was best predicted by the total concentration of lead in the soil, irrespective of the original lead compound added to the soil. This research suggests that the original Pb compounds that contaminated the soil are unlikely to be an important factor in assessing Pb bioavailability, and hence risk, in soils.","Improved sludge dewaterability by tannic acid conditioning: Temperature, thermodynamics and mechanism studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102867,Chemosphere,2019 06 02,"Waste activated sludge (WAS), containing biological pathogens, chemical elements and high moisture (>99%), was generated continually from municipal sewage treatment plants. Sludge dewatering could diminish the volume of WAS and control the diffusion of environmental pollution efficiently. In this study, tannic acid (TA), as a plant-derived phenolic compound, was investigated for improving WAS dewaterability at different temperatures. Apparently, the WAS dewaterability was enhanced by TA conditioning in the range of 25-55 °C, but further increase in temperature did not significantly affect the dewatering. With the TA addition of 0.15 mmol/gTS (total solid) at 55 °C, the WAS dewaterability was improved by 84.5% decrease in capillary suction time (CST), 96.5% decrease in specific resistance of filtration (SRF), and 19.9% decrease in water content (Wc) of dewatered sludge cake. TA facilitated removing supernatant viscosity and protein of sludge EPS (extracellular polymeric substances), specifically with 88.9% and 75.0% protein removal of slime EPS (S-EPS) and loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS). Thermodynamics modeling revealed that the improved dewaterability was dominantly attributed to the hydrophobic bonding between TA and EPS proteins, which was strengthened with the increase in temperature. However, when the conditioning temperature exceeded 55 °C, thermal effect took place and accelerated the release of biopolymers into EPS and hence, counteracted the beneficial effect of TA conditioning to further improve WAS dewatering. The results offered not only the dewatering effectiveness and mechanism of TA conditioning, but also a potential approach of applying plant waste to treat WAS for the high dewaterability.",Effect of anions species on copper removal from wastewater by using mechanically activated calcium carbonate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102866,Chemosphere,2019 06 02,"In this work, the wastewater containing sulfate ions, nitrate ions or chloride ions was used to investigate the performance of anions in copper removal by mechanically activated calcium carbonate. The copper removal from wastewater containing sulfate anion achieved almost 99% with the CaCO3/Cu molar ratio of 1:1. However, the copper removal from wastewater containing nitrate and chloride anions are lower than 20% and 35%, respectively. The precipitations from wastewater containing different anions were analyzed by using XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDS and XPS, respectively. Cu (II) in wastewater containing sulfate anion is precipitated in the form of posnjakite. The nitrate anion precipitates as gerhardtite, whereas chloride anion as atacamite and botallackite. The solubility of precipitation plays a decisive role in copper removal so that sulfate anions have a superior effect on Cu (II) precipitation due to relatively stable posnjakite with the lowest solubility, suggesting that this method using mechanically activated calcium carbonate is more suitable and effective for the wastewater containing sulfate anion.",Improving membrane distillation performance: Morphology optimization of hollow fiber membranes with selected non-solvent in dope solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102865,Chemosphere,2019 06 02,"This study aimed at improving membrane distillation (MD) performance by mixing various non-solvents (NSs) in polymer dope solutions. The effect of each NS on the inner structure and surface morphology of hollow fiber (HF) membrane was investigated. Membrane morphology is manipulated by controlling liquid-liquid (L-L) and solid-liquid (S-L) demixing time, which is a function of the viscosity and water affinity of dope solutions. Consequently, the addition of NSs altered membrane morphology by affecting the diffusion rate during NS induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The performance results showed that the dope solution composed of 11/71.2/17.8 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/triethyl phosphate (TEP)/toluene produced the most promising HF membrane for MD. The optimal membrane demonstrated a unique bicontinuous structure with increased porosity and mean pore size. The addition of toluene as NS in dope solutions enhanced crystallization process, which increased the Young's modulus of membrane but slightly decreased its maximum tensile strength at break. The optimal PVDF HF membrane demonstrated a steady flux of 18.9 LMH at 60 °C/20 °C of feed/permeate temperatures and a salt rejection of 99.99% when tested for 72 h. The results suggest that incorporation of toluene as a NS into PVDF dope solutions can increase permeation performance in MD by enhancing the morphology of HF membranes.",Impact of meteorological and social events on human-excreted contaminant loads in raw wastewater: From daily to weekly dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102864,Chemosphere,2019 06 02,"The temporal dynamics of the wastewater influent loads of 25 drug target residues (DTR, both pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs) was assessed during 84 consecutive days. This monitoring scale enables longer temporal patterns than weekday/weekend patterns to be explored. In this study, we focus on day to day variations and the potential statistical correlation of each DTR analyzed in order to better understand the potential forcings that lead to the load variation of DTRs (alone or in clusters). The weekly patterns based on the weekly loads of DTRs were also analyzed and the impact of social and meteorological events on their variations was investigated. Two cold events occurred during the monitoring period and were associated with the highest loads of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as the lowest loads of stimulants. During the Easter holidays, a significant decrease in some year-long medication as well as analgesics was found, consistent with the demographic decrease within the catchment during this period. Lastly, a good correlation between the academic calendar and the loads of stimulants was found, emphasizing the overrepresentation of students in the consumption of recreational drugs. This study furnishes new insights in order to better understand the variations in DTR loads in wastewater influents, beyond the weekday/weekend pattern and the seasonal effect. Further investigations remain necessary, especially a real-time monitoring of the population figures within the catchment in order to improve our understanding of these results.",Short-term supplement of virgin coconut oil improves endothelial-dependent dilation but not exercise-mediated hyperemia in young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102863,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 06,"Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is high in antioxidants, which reduce reactive oxygen species-induced conversion of vascular endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) to toxic peroxynitrite. As such, flow-mediated dilation (FMD, a surrogate marker of NO bioavailability) and exercise-mediated hyperemia may be enhanced following VCO treatment. Animal research supports these findings, but direct assessments of FMD after short-term VCO use in humans are unknown. We tested the hypotheses that a 4-week VCO supplement (30 mL·d-1) would improve popliteal artery (PA) FMD and the hyperemic response to aerobic exercise. Thirty-four young adults were divided into VCO (n = 19, 9 women, 22 ± 2 years, 24 ± 3 kg·m-2) and control (CON: n = 15, 7 women, 24 ± 2 years, 24 ± 3 kg·m-2) groups. PA-FMD and blood flow were assessed via high-resolution duplex ultrasonography (Vivid i, GE Healthcare, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). PA blood flow was measured at rest and for 5 minutes following a 10-minute bout of moderate-intensity (60% heart rate reserve) cycling exercise. Total PA blood volume was calculated as the integral of the 5-minute postexercise PA blood flow response. After 4 weeks, PA-FMD increased (P = .04) following VCO supplementation (4.9% ± 0.9% to 5.5% ± 1.2%) with no change (P > .9) in the CON group (5.7% ± 2.1% to 5.8% ± 1.9%). There were no differences (both P > .28) in the postexercise total PA blood volume response in either group (VCO: 495 ± 355 to 598 ± 384 mL; CON: 562 ± 362 to 488 ± 229 mL). Short-term VCO supplementation does not alter aerobic exercise-mediated blood flow responses in young adults. However, the augmented popliteal FMD response observed in the VCO supplement group indicates that short-term VCO supplementation improves vascular endothelial function in young, healthy adults.",Shaping the human brain: evolutionary cis-regulatory plasticity drives changes in synaptic activity-controlled adaptive gene expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102862,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 11,"Neuronal activity-induced gene expression programs involved in synaptic structure- and plasticity-related functions are similar in mice and humans, yet bear distinct features. These include gains or losses of activity-responsiveness of certain genes and differences in gene induction profiles. Here, we discuss a possible origin of dissimilarities in activity-regulated transcription between species. We highlight that while synapse-to-nucleus signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, cis-regulatory plasticity has been driving species-specific remodelling of the activity-controlled enhancer landscape, thereby affecting gene regulation. In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other trans-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription. It is conceivable that cis-regulatory plasticity may have equipped the synaptic activity-driven adaptive gene program in human neurons with unique, species-specific qualities.",Apparent synonymous mutation F9 c.87A>G causes secretion failure by in-frame mutation with aberrant splicing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102861,Thrombosis research,2019 06 08,"Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene (F9) mutations. Several F9 synonymous mutations have been known to cause hemophilia B; however, the deleterious mechanisms underlying the development of hemophilia B have not been completely understood. To elucidate the molecular pathogenesis causing hemophilia B, we investigated the synonymous F9 mutation: c.87A>G, p.(Thr29=).",Lithium ion-selective membrane with 2D subnanometer channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102860,Water research,2019 06 04,"In the last two years, the rapidly rising demand for lithium has exceeded supply, resulting in a sharp increase in the price of the metal. Conventional electric driven membrane processes can separate Li+ from divalent cations, but there is virtually no commercial membrane that can efficiently and selectively extract Li+ from a solution containing chemically similar ions such as Na+ and K+. Here, we show that the different movement behavior of Li+ ion within the sub-nanometre channel leads to Li+ ion-selectivity and high transport rate. Using inexpensive negatively charged 2D subnanometer hydrous phyllosilicate channels with interlayer space of 0.43 nm in a membrane-like morphology, we observed that for an interlayer spacing of below 1 nm, Li+ ions move along the length of the channel by jumping between its two walls. However, for above 1 nm spacing, the ions used only one channel wall to jump and travel. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation also revealed that ions within the nanochannel exhibit acceleration-deceleration behavior. Experimental results showed that the nanochannels could selectively transport monovalent ions of Li+> Na+> and K+ while excluding other ions such as Cl- and Ca2+, with the selectivity ratios of 1.26, 1.59 and 1.36 for Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Na+/K+ respectively, which far exceed the mobility ratios in traditional porous ion exchange membranes. The findings of this work provide researchers with not only a new understanding of ions movement behavior within subnanometer confined areas but also make a platform for the future design of ion-selective membranes."

Assuming no change in Helmholtz free energy between two local equilibrium states we find that Δa1scosθt=κϕΔS1+Δa12, where a is the interfacial area per unit volume, ϕ is the porosity, S is the saturation and κ the curvature of the fluid-fluid interface. The subscript s denotes the solid, and we consider changes, Δ, in saturation and area. With the advent of high-resolution time-resolved three-dimensional X-ray imaging, all the terms in this expression can be measured directly. We analyse imaging datasets for displacement of oil by water in a water-wet and a mixed-wet sandstone. For the water-wet sample, the curvature is positive and oil bulges into the brine with almost spherical interfaces. In the mixed-wet case, larger interfacial areas are found, as the oil resides in layers. The mean curvature is close to zero, but the interface tends to bulge into brine in one direction, while brine bulges into oil in the other. We compare θt with the values measured geometrically in situ on the pore-scale images, θg. The thermodynamic angle θt provides a robust and consistent characterization of wettability. For the water-wet case the calculated value of θt gives an accurate prediction of multiphase flow properties using pore-scale modelling.",A simple wet-chemical strategy for facile fabrication of hierarchical PdAu nanodentrites as excellent electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102848,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 06 12,"Herein, a simple one-pot wet-chemical method was presented for facile preparation of three-dimensional (3D) PdAu nanodentrites (NDs) containing plenty of local high-index and low-index facets at room temperature, adopting 3-amino-1,2,4- triazole-5-carboxylic acid (ATCA) as the structure-guiding agent, without any seed or surfactant. The feeding ratios of the Pd/Au precursors, the concentration of ATCA and the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) have great effects on the PdAu nanostructures. The as-prepared PdAu NDs exhibited dramatically enhanced catalytic properties towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under the alkaline conditions, showing the more positive half-wave potential (0.890 V) relative to commercial Pd black (0.808 V), coupled with the 8.3-fold enlargement in mass activity (MA).

However, improvement in surface wettability of PDMS is highly desired for microfluidic and biomedical applications as its surface is inherently hydrophobic in nature that restricts flow of aqueous fluid or adherence of biomolecules onto its surface. In spite of several surface modification techniques, prompt recurrence of hydrophobic properties is quite typical in PDMS. Here, we demonstrate a facile and a permanent conversion of a hydrophobic PDMS sponge onto a superhydrophilic state. PDMS sponge was prepared using an eco-friendly sugar leaching method and modified by an ultra-thin coating of polyacrylic acid (PAA). The resultant PDMS-PAA hybrid sponge was found to have highly stable and sustained superhydrophilic property for more than 18 months with water absorption efficiency as high as 89%. Valuable applications like, portable pressure pump in a microfluidic device and as a bioactive matrix for microbial cell immobilization for biodegradation of distillery industry effluent treatment has been demonstrated using these surface modified PDMS sponges.",Colloidal-electrochemical fabrication strategies for functional composites of linear polyethylenimine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102846,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 06 12,"Colloidal-electrochemical fabrication strategies have been developed for the deposition of linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) composite materials. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) allowed for the fabrication of composite films containing Mn3O4 and ZnO nanoparticles, as well as advanced flame retardant materials, such as halloysite nanotubes and memory-type Al-Mg-Zr complex hydroxide (AMZ) in the matrix of the water-insoluble LPEI. A liquid-liquid extraction method has been designed for the agglomerate-free processing of AMZ particles. Efficient extraction was achieved using decylphosphonic acid as an extractor. A conceptually new polymer complex (PC)-EPD method has been developed, which is based on the use of LPEI-metal ion complexes. Proof-of-concept studies involved the fabrication of LPEI-Ni(OH)2 and LPEI-MnOx nanocomposites. The composites showed valuable flame retardant and charge-storage properties. The analysis of basic EPD and PC-EPD mechanisms as well as complexing properties of LPEI has driven the development of new strategies for the fabrication of organic composites. Hemoglobin was used as a model protein for the fabrication of composite films. Another important finding was the fabrication of composites, containing cyclodextrin, which is a unique carrier of various functional organic molecules. EPD and PC-EPD are versatile methods, which allow for the deposition of novel LPEI based composites containing various functional materials.","Effect of exogenous catechin on alleviating O3 stress: The role of catechin-quinone in lipid peroxidation, salicylic acid, chlorophyll content, and antioxidant enzymes of Zamioculcas zamiifolia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102845,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Ozone (O3) can cause oxidative stress in plants and humans. Catechin is an antioxidant that enriches tea and can probably increase O3 tolerance in plants. To investigate the mechanism of catechin to alleviate O3 stress in plants, Zamiocalcus zamiifolia (an efficient plant for O3 phytoremediation) was sprayed with 5 mM catechin and was used to expose O3 (150-250) under long-term operation (10 cycles). We investigated whether exogenous catechin could enhance O3 removal and alleviate O3 stress through a balanced redox state in plants. Z. zamiifolia sprayed with catechin exhibited higher O3 removal (80.27±3.12%), than Z. zamiifolia without catechin (50.03±2.68%). O3 in the range of 150-250 ppb led to stress in plants, as shown by an increased malondialdehyde content (MDA) and salicylic acid (SA). Whereas under the presence of O3, exogenous catechin could maintain the MDA content and inhibit SA accumulation. Under Z. zamiifolia+catechin+O3 conditions, catechin reacted with O3, which led to the formation of catechin-quinone. The formation of catechin-quinone was confirmed by the depletion of reduced glutathione content (GSH). This catechin-quinone could induce GST and APX genes that are up-regulated approximately 35- and 5-fold, respectively. Hence, Z. zamiifolia+catechin+O3 conditions had higher performance for coping with oxidative stress than did Z. zamiifolia+O3 conditions. This evidence demonstrates that catechin could enhance O3 removal through a balanced redox state in plant cells. Finally, the application of tea extract for enhanced O3 removal is also shown in this study.",Adsorption of fluoride from aqueous solution by fly ash cenospheres modified with paper mill lime mud: Experimental and modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102844,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Fluoride removal from aqueous solution by adsorption using fly ash cenospheres (FAC) modified with paper mill lime mud (LM) as composite adsorbent had been investigated. The characterization of FAC and composite adsorbent were analyzed by Scanning electron spectroscope (SEM), Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Brunauer emmett teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), which demonstrated that the porous structure of composite adsorbent was obtained after surface modification. Adsorption of fluoride on modified fly ash cenospheres was fitted with pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to investigate the effects of F- concentration, pH, adsorbent dosage and temperature on the removal efficiency. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the adequacy of the mathematical models. The Nonelectrostatic model of modified fly ash cenospheres adsorbing fluoride was built through the Generalized composite method, indicating that two inner-spherical complexes, ≡SF and ≡SOHF-, were formed in the adsorption process by means of the ligand exchange and surface complexation.

Previous research studies commonly utilized individual pollutant groups and their quantity to evaluate the hazard effect of pollutants attached to RDS in terms of stormwater reuse. Since many types of organic pollutants are present together rather than individually, conventional approaches might not permit a comprehensive understanding of how appropriately the RDS polluted stormwater can be reused. This study undertook a toxicity test of organic pollutants attached to RDS using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), testing a hypothesis that solely focusing on individual pollutant groups are not adequate to represent hazard effects of resulting stormwater and hence their adequacy for reuse. It is noted that comparative toxicity of RDS is not strongly related to total solids (commonly seen as the key carrier of pollutants) and chemical oxygen demand (COD, representing organic matters). Additionally, the comparison results of spatial distributions of toxicity (in this study) and individual pollutants in previous studies did not show a similar trend. These results imply that toxicity should be also used to indicate how stormwater can be safely reused while solely investigating individual pollutants can not adequately show a comprehensive hazard effect in terms of ensuring stormwater reuse safety. Based on study outcomes, a new assessment approach considering both pollutant and toxicity were proposed. This will assist on effective stormwater reuse and ensuring their reuse safety.",Soil nutrient and microbial activity responses to two years after maize straw biochar application in a calcareous soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102842,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Biochar (BC) addition to soil is a strategy to enhance soil fertility, which may also affect microbial activity. However, little information is available on the responses of soil nutrients and microbial activities to BC in a calcareous soil. This study investigated the changes of soil nutrient contents and microbial activities in a calcareous soil two years after application of biochar at rate of 0, 2.5, 7.5 and 22.5 t/ha. The results showed that the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and available phosphorus and potassium increased significantly with increasing BC addition rate, but no significant effect on soil pH. Soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MBC and MBN) had an increased and then decreased trend. BC amendment increased microbial biomass and promoted soil carbon- and nitrogen-cycling enzyme activities, the ratios of β-glucosaminidase/phosphomonoesterase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase plus leucine aminopeptidase/phosphomonoesterase increased significantly with increasing BC addition rate. Redundancy analysis confirmed that DOC and MBN were dominant factors affecting soil microbial biomass, and soil pH, TDN, DOC, MBN and SOC were main factors regulating soil enzyme activities. Besides, principal component analysis revealed that difference in microbial community composition in one year after BC addition was mainly associated with the relative abundance of bacteria and fungi, the relative abundance of bacteria increased, while the ratios of Gram-negative/Gram-positive bacteria and fungi/bacteria, and relative abundance of fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi decreased in BC-amended soils with control. However, BC had no significant effect on microbial community composition after two years. These results suggest that application of maize BC to calcareous soils may have a great potential for improvements in the soil nutrients and enzyme activity, the changes in soil microbial composition deserve further studies.","Exogenous melatonin-mediated modulation of arsenic tolerance with improved accretion of secondary metabolite production, activating antioxidant capacity and improved chloroplast ultrastructure in rosemary herb.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102841,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Arsenic (As) recognized as a group I human carcinogen additionally poses a threat to plants which limit growth, metabolic activity, and productivity.

Conversely, the role of MEL in inducing As-tolerance remains inexpressible and the plausible mechanisms in inducing As tolerance have remained largely unknown. The present investigation was designed to understand the protective role of MEL concentrations in rosemary herbs cultivated under As contamination. Arsenic evoked a deleterious decline on herb productivity, photosynthetic pigment, ion concentration, water status, ascorbic acid, essential oil (EO) yield and induced malformation of the chloroplast. Alternatively, increased organic osmolytes, oxidative impairment criteria, additionally antioxidant enzymes, phenol, flavonoid, anthocyanin, and EO%. Exogenous application of MEL with or without As, considerably increased growth, photosynthetic pigment, ion concentration, organic osmolytes as well as EO yield regarding polluted or non-polluted treatment respectively. Moreover, MEL treatment stabilized the cell membrane integrity, suppressed oxidative impairment criteria, and enhanced antioxidant capacity, additionally upregulation antioxidant enzymes. Plant treated with As showed a significant increase in As contamination and a bioconcentration factor in both root and shoot system. MEL supplementation under normal or As concentration, reduced As accumulation and bioconcentration factors, in either shoot or root systems. Additionally As decrease transfer factor, however, supplementation of MEL further decreased it.

The agar-disc diffusion assay during the serial passages of TCS exposure and subsequent exposure withdrawal showed clinically insignificant changes in the zone of inhibition for six selected antibiotics in both bacterial strains at all exposure concentrations. Four folds concentration-dependent increase in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of TCS was observed in both the strains following TCS exposure. Similarly, a concentration-dependent increase in the MICs of oxytetracycline (OTC) up to 4 folds in A. hydrophila, and up to 8 folds in E. tarda, was also documented during the TCS exposure. In all the cases, withdrawal of TCS exposure effectively reduced the MICs of TCS and OTC in blank passages suggesting a decline in acquired resistance. The frequencies of mutation during 30 min TCS exposure for E. tarda and A. hydrophila ranged between >10-6 and 10-7 levels. Nevertheless, the TCS exposure did not cause any detectable mutation on the fabV gene of A. hydrophila indicating that the TCS may elicit phenotypic adaptation or other resistance mechanism. Although the reduction in MICs due to exposure withdrawal did not restore the bacterial susceptibility up to the initial level, the study proved that the reduced TCS use could significantly help reduce the antimicrobial-resistance and cross-resistance in pathogenic bacteria."

To date, there is no cure to CHD, however, progress in surgery has reduced its mortality allowing children affected by CHD to reach adulthood. In an effort to understand its genetic basis, several studies involving whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of patients with CHD have been undertaken and generated a great wealth of information. The majority of putative causative mutations identified in WGS studies fall into the non-coding part of the genome. Unfortunately, due to the lack of understanding of the function of these non-coding mutations, it is challenging to establish a causal link between the non-coding mutation and the disease. Thus, here we review the state-of-the-art approaches to interpret non-coding mutations in the context of CHD and address the following questions: What are the non-coding sequences important for cardiac function? Which technologies are used to identify them? Which resources are available to analyse them? What mutations are expected in these non-coding sequences? Learning from developmental process, what is their expected role in CHD?",Potential benefits of using a multicomponent vaccine for prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102824,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 06 16,"Meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) has become the main cause of invasive meningococcal disease in industrialized countries in recent years. The diversity of MenB strains and poor immunogenicity of the MenB capsular polysaccharide have made vaccine development challenging. Two MenB vaccines, including factor H binding protein (fHbp) as a major antigenic component, are now licensed for use. In addition to fHbp variant 1, the multicomponent vaccine 4CMenB contains neisserial heparin binding antigen, Neisseria adhesin A, and outer membrane vesicles containing porin A. The vast majority of circulating MenB strains contain genes encoding at least one 4CMenB component and many express genes for more than one vaccine antigen. Recent studies have suggested that serum bactericidal activity is enhanced against strains that express two or more vaccine antigens. Bacterial killing may also occur when antibodies to vaccine components are collectively present at levels that would individually be sub-lethal. The evaluation of immune responses to separate vaccine components does not take cooperative activity into account and may underestimate the overall protection. Available data on 4CMenB effectiveness indicate that this multicomponent vaccine affords broad coverage and protection against MenB disease. 4CMenB also has the potential to protect against disease caused by non-MenB meningococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.",Cefazolin-gentamicin versus taurolidine-citrate for the prevention of infection in tunneled central catheters in hemodialysis patients: A quasi-experimental trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102823,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 06 16,"Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) is one of various complications related to hemodialysis (HD).

This compound, as well as other pharmaceuticals can greatly affect the environment, the soil and organisms in it and pollute aquatic ecosystems. Since it has been used for only a few decades, knowledge of their fate and behaviour in the environment is still limited. Because of that, the aim of this study was to experimentally determine the Kd values of nitrofurantoin in seven different natural soil and seven different sediment samples with different physico-chemical properties. Sorption phenomena were described with Linear, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich sorption isotherms. Obtained sorption coefficients (Kd) ranged from 3.967 to 5.121 mLg-1 for sediment samples and 3.634-43.06 mL g-1 for soil samples. The influence of ionic strength and pH of the nitrofurantoin solution and kinetics of the sorption and desorption process were also investigated. Results show that an increase in ionic strength and pH reduces the values of sorption coefficient while the mechanism of nitrofurantoin sorption is the best described with the kinetic model of pseudo-second order.",Specific sediment yield model for reservoirs with medium-sized basins in Spain: An empirical and statistical approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102819,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 05,"The world's reservoirs are losing capacity at a rate of 0.5-1% a year due to sedimentation processes. The strategies to reverse this trend must include an accurate estimation of sedimentation rates in terms of Specific Sediment Yield (SSY). This research develops an empirical and statistical model based on data from the CEDEX (Spanish Studies and Experimentation Centre for Public Works). From an initial number of 131 reservoirs studied in the period 19,672,004, a group of 26 reservoirs with medium-sized basins (750 to 1750 km2) was selected for analysis. Reservoir catchments were described with 11 explanatory variables, representing the production, transport and deposition of sediment, although the calibrated model considers only six of these variables: Fournier Index (Rainfall Torrentiality), Drainage Length, Reservoir Coefficient (relation between reservoir capacity and area), C (USLE Land Cover Factor), Yearly Average Rainfall and Slope. SSY and the explanatory variables were transformed during the calibration process, and the resulting model shows a non-linear relation between them. Compared to other models calculated with CEDEX data with a determination coefficient of between 17% and 80%, this model has a determination coefficient of 84%, is statistically consistent, validated by means of a jackknife analysis and contrasted with other models. However, the model is not cross validated with information on additional reservoirs, and shows substantial uncertainty and instability deriving from the definition of the explanatory variables and the quality of the data set, so extrapolation to other reservoirs is only possible under supervision and local calibration. However, the model reveals a strong non-linear relation between land cover, rainfall amount and torrentiality, slope gradient, drainage length and reservoir depth with SSY, and provides valuable information for exploring the effect of watershed alterations on sedimentation.",On the origin of rural landscapes: Looking for physico-chemical fingerprints of historical agricultural practice in the Atlantic Basque Country (N Spain).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102818,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 05,"Evolution and change in agricultural practice is a major factor in the codification of social relations and represents one of the main resources employed by human societies to establish a durable relationship with their environment. Using a multi-proxy integrated approach, this paper seeks to decipher the long-term dynamics that have shaped agricultural landscapes in the Basque Country (N Spain). Social and economic indicators (archival records, toponymy and oral sources) are used along with geological core sampling (geochemistry, magnetic, palynological and carpological analyses) to reconstruct a diachronic sequence of human settlement and agricultural management in the village of Aizarna over the last ~1500 years. The oldest records obtained refer to non-agricultural human activities dating back to the Roman period. Later on, traces of agricultural landscape-transformation can be divided into four main phases: 1) the onset of terraced agriculture, defined by the clearance and terracing of previous forested areas during the Early Middle Ages; 2) a Late Medieval reorganisation, with new terraces being (re)constructed close to dispersed farmsteads, linked to the emergence of the modern rural landscape; 3) a new model of intensive polyculture developed during the Modern period as a consequence of the introduction of new crops of American origin; and 4) the mechanisation and commercialisation of the agricultural production over the 20th century. These results provide a valuable pathway for the investigation of currently inhabited rural contexts, and offer, for the first time in this region, an overview on long-term landscape construction in the Atlantic areas of the Basque Country."

In the present work, initially we designed κ-carrageenan grafted with maleic anhydride and then reacted it with isoniazid drug (κ-Car-MA-INH). The polymeric system was cross linked with nanohydroxyapatite (NHAP) via electrostatic interaction followed by the addition of rifampicin (RF) and loaded to fabricate κ -Car-MA-INH/NHAP/RF nanocomposites. The chemical modification and interaction of drug with the polymeric-ceramic system were characterised by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The zeta potential of the κ -Car-MA-INH/NHAP/RF nanocomposite was observed to be -20.04 mV using Zetasizer. The in vitro drug release studies demonstrated that the nanocomposite releases 76% of RF and 82% of INH in 12 days at pH 5.5. Scanning Electron Microscope analysis revealed the structural deformation of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae upon treatment with this nanocomposite. By using ex-vivo studies combined with physio-chemical characterization methods on the erythrocytes, L929 and MG-63 cell lines, this composite was found to be biocompatible, non-cytotoxic and inducing cell proliferation with less significant hemolysis. Thus, our modified drug delivery nanocomposites afforded higher drug bioavailability with large potential for fabrication as long-acting drug delivery nanocomposites, especially with hydrophobic drugs inducing the growth of osteoblastic bone cells.",Strategizing biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles to cross the biological barriers for cancer targeting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102804,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"The biological barriers in the body have been fabricated by nature to protect the body from foreign molecules.

Using freshly excised dermatomed human skin modified to reflect poor barrier function and a model hydrophilic compound, Sulforhodamine B (SRB), FC permeation and retention quantification was compared to the 96-well high-throughput system (HTS). The skin was analyzed using 2-photon microscopy to determine the drug distribution within the skin. A screen of 15 different formulations in triplicate in a single piece of human skin, using full factorial design was then conducted. Permeability of SRB across the skin as well as the drug distribution profile of SRB retained in the skin were similar for the FC and HTS system. The influence of different excipients on drug retention was observed in the full factorial formulation screen. The HTS method is promising for the investigation of large numbers of formulations and the influence of formulations changes in skin retention of drug.",Rapid and continuous accumulation of nitric oxide-releasing liposomes in tumors to augment the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102802,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"The modulation of blood flow to tumors is a prominent strategy for improving the tumor accumulation of nanomedicines, resulting from the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

Herein, we study NO-LP in greater detail to clarify its practical use as an EPR enhancer. NO-LP was found to have advantages as a NO donor, including the ability to maintain NO donation over long periods of time, and a constant rate of NO-release irrespective of the environmental pH. NO-LP showed rapid accumulation in tumor tissue after injection (1 h), and then accumulation was continuously enhanced until 48 h.

Although de Gennes was not concerned with the size of particles, due to the advent and perspectives of nanotechnology, nanosized Janus particles have particularly received great attention. The capacity of having two antagonistic properties within the same particle has attracted interest on Janus nanoparticles for innumerous potential applications. It took some years for the studies about Janus nanoparticles to finally see great advances, mainly due to the progress in nanoparticle synthesis. What de Gennes might have not predicted (or at least he did not mention it during his speech) is that intermolecular interactions between polymers would be of immense importance to the actual achievement of Janus nanoparticles. Moreover, these interactions can also have large effects on the assembly process of amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles, which is important to form hierarchical structures and new materials at different scales. Hence, it is interesting to notice that de Gennes' contribution for the polymer field has been influencing the preparation and the controlled assembly of Janus nanoparticles.

Clay minerals have shown promising potentials in binding harmful microorganisms and metabolites due to their high adsorption capacity. This study evaluated the effects of a clay-mineral based product (CM) on PaM, EpM, fermentation parameters, and epithelial gene expression in cows fed a high-concentrate diet. Eight rumen-cannulated non-lactating Holstein cows received a concentrate mix supplemented with CM or not (CON) in a change-over design with an initial 100% roughage diet phase (RD, 1 week), followed by intermittent 65%-high-concentrate-diet phases (HC1, HC2; 1 and 2 week duration, respectively), interrupted by 1 week roughage only. Rumen samples for short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate quantification, as well as PaM, and epithelial biopsies for EpM examination and epithelial gene expression were collected via the cannula once during each feeding phase. Phylogenetic distance analysis of Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene region V345 showed a clear clustering of RD microbiota compared to HC in PaM, showing the impact of the high-concentrate diet on the bacterial community. In the EpM this effect was less pronounced, due to higher variability in RD. In the PaM, a decrease (P < 0.01) of community diversity occurred with the onset of HC feeding, while in the EpM there was an increase in diversity (P < 0.05). In the PaM, CM increased the relative abundance of genus Butyrivibrio (P < 0.01), a commensal bacterium of the rumen, which was, with 6.4%, the second most abundant genus. There, the CM supplementation decreased the genera Lactobacillus, Fusobacterium, and Treponema (P = 0.05), which are potentially either lactate producing or opportunistic pathogens. In the EpM, CM decreased the relative abundance of Succiniclasticum genus (P < 0.01), a possible endotoxin producer, and increased bacteria that are associated with a normobiotic rumen, such as Campylobacter (P = 0.06). Barrier function genes were upregulated in HC2 and nutrient transport genes downregulated in HC1 (P < 0.05); however, there was little effect on pro-inflammatory genes at the epithelium.

Treatment requires a multimodal approach, with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiosurgery, which allows a long-term local control (LC) and an extension of free survival (PFS). In this study, the authors performed a review of the literature and reported two cases of patients affected by extracranial MMs, with long-term follow-up. CASE 1: a 48 yo woman was admitted for resection of an extra-axial falx lesion (meningioma G1). After two years, the lesion got a local recurrence, resected with a histological diagnosis of meningioma G3. During the following 9 years, the patient underwent 5 times GKRS for local recurrence. At 56 yo, she was readmitted for a surgical local recurrence (histological definition: anaplastic meningioma G3). At age 62 yo, the patient underwent to right lobectomy for a lung mass (histological diagnosis: anaplastic meningioma G3). After that, multiple lesions at soma L5 and adrenal gland were discovered and then monitored. CASE 2: a 48 yo woman was operated for a lesion involving torcular Erophilii (meningioma G2). After three years, a local recurrence requires GKRS combined with Tamoxifene. In the next seven years, she underwent 5 GKRS for local recurrence. The patient also carried out chemotherapy with Octeotride. At age 61 yo, she discovered multiple lesions in both lungs, liver, kidney. An hepatic biopsy showed anaplastic meningioma G3. Also this patient does not suffers from any neurological neither clinical deficits. LC in malignant meningioma is achievable through a multimodal approach; GKRS make possible LC but a novel aspect of these lesions is opened to discussion: the metastases. Those reports shows that multimodal treatment for MMs is an effective approach with good LC and improvement of overall survival. However a long survival may allow systemic diffusion of the disease in particular when sagittal sinus are involved."

A disruption in the development of endometrial receptivity is responsible for recurrent implantation failures (RIF) of endometrial origin. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind the endometrial receptivity process, we used the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method to compare three different endometrial statuses: fertile women, intrauterine device (IUD) carriers, and RIF patients. Overall, iTRAQ allowed identified 1889 non-redundant proteins. Of these, 188 were differentially expressed proteins (DEP) (p-value < .05). Pairwise comparisons revealed 133 significant DEP in fertile vs. IUD carriers and 158 DEP in RIF vs. IUD carriers. However, no DEP were identified between fertile and RIF patients. Western blot validation of three DEP involved in endometrial receptivity (plastin 2, lactotransferrin, and lysozyme) confirmed our iTRAQ results. Moreover, functional KEGG enrichment revealed that complement and coagulation cascades and peroxisome were the two most significant pathways for the RIF vs. IUD comparison and ribosome and spliceosome for the fertile vs. IUD comparison, as possible important pathways involved in the endometrial receptivity acquisition. The lack of DEP between fertile and RIF patient endometria suggest that idiopathic RIF may not have an endometrial origin, with other as-yet-unknown factors involved. SIGNIFICANCE: A pilot study where a comparison of the endometrial protein profile from women with different endometrial receptive grade (fertile women, IUD carriers and RIF patients) during the same period of time (overlapping with the window of implantation) of a hormone replacement therapy was performed using a high-throughput proteomic technique. This approach lead us to better understand the molecular mechanisms undergoing endometrial receptivity, a time-limiting step to achieve pregnancy in humans. Moreover, the number of samples per group (10 Fertile women, 10 IUD carriers and 8 RIF patients) according to the methodology here employed (8plex iTRAQ), give more robustness to our results. Our findings confirm that an IUD introduces numerous changes in the endometrial protein profile when compared to fertile and RIF endometria, revealing some key proteins involved in endometrial receptivity. Finding no significant differences between Fertile and RIF patient endometria could suggest that other as-yet-unknown factors could be involved in the etiology of idiopathic RIF.",High temperature-induced proteomic and metabolomic profiles of a thermophilic Bacillus manusensis isolated from the deep-sea hydrothermal field of Manus Basin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102757,Journal of proteomics,2019 06 16,"Thermophiles are organisms that grow optimally at 50 °C-80 °C and studies on the survival mechanisms of thermophiles have drawn great attention. Bacillus manusensis S50-6 is the type strain of a new thermophilic species isolated from hydrothermal vent in Manus Basin. In this study, we examined the growth and global responses of S50-6 to high temperature on molecular level using multi-omics method (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). S50-6 grew optimally at 50 °C (Favorable, F) and poorly at 65 °C (Non-Favorable, NF); it formed spores at F but not at NF condition. At NF condition, S50-6 formed long filaments containing undivided cells. A total of 1621 proteins were identified at F and NF conditions, and 613 proteins were differentially expressed between F and NF. At NF condition, proteins of glycolysis, rRNA mature and modification, and DNA/protein repair were up-regulated, whereas proteins of sporulation and amino acid/nucleotide metabolism were down-regulated. Consistently, many metabolites associated with amino acid and nucleotide metabolic processes were down-regulated at NF condition. Our results revealed molecular strategies of deep-sea B. manusensis to survive at unfavorable high temperature and provided new insights into the thermotolerant mechanisms of thermophiles. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we systematically characterized the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles of a thermophilic deep-sea Bacillus manusensis under different temperatures. Based on these analysis, we propose a model delineating the global responses of B. manusensis to unfavorable high temperature. Under unfavorable high temperature, glycolysis is a more important energy supply pathway; protein synthesis is subjected to more stringent regulation by increased tRNA modification; protein and DNA repair associated proteins are enhanced in production to promote heat survival. In contrast, energy-costing pathways, such as sporulation, are repressed, and basic metabolic pathways, such as amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms, are slowed down. Our results provide new insights into the thermotolerant mechanisms of thermophilic Bacillus.",Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the ethanol stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sc131.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102756,Journal of proteomics,2019 06 16,"The molecular mechanism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae tolerant to ethanol stress remains to be further elucidated. In this study, a comprehensive analysis based on RNA-seq and iTRAQ LC-MS/MS was used to investigate the global mechanism of S. cerevisiae strain Sc131 in response to ethanol stress at transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Totally, 937 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 457 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in Sc131 under ethanol stress. Results revealed that 4-h ethanol stress (10% v/v) can induce filamentous growth, sexual reproduction. Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were proved to be two important organelles in resisting ethanol stress. Signal transduction such as G-protein coupled receptor signaling and metal ion regulation were remarkably activated at the presence of ethanol. Moreover, silent information regulator (Sir) proteins and aromatic amino acids especially tryptophan were involved in response to ethanol and might be helpful for cell survival. This study provides a global perspective on the mechanism of S. cerevisiae tolerant to ethanol stress and sheds light on the potential application of Sc131 in Chinese bayberry wine brewing. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: It is of great importance for S. cerevisiae to tolerate high levels of ethanol during wine fermentation. However, the molecular mechanism of S. cerevisiae tolerant to ethanol stress remains to be further elucidated at transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In present study, we employed a comprehensive analysis based on RNA-seq and iTRAQ and found several potential pathways involving in the response of Sc131 to ethanol stress.

In this study, we use quantitative proteomics analysis to investigate the mechanism of Hsp90 in BmNPV replication. In total, 195 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified with 136 up-regulated proteins and 59 down-regulated proteins. The protein expression level of small heat shock proteins, immune-related proteins, cellular DNA repair-related proteins and zinc finger proteins is significantly enhanced while that of protein kinases is declined. KEGG pathway analysis reveals that DEPs are involved in longevity regulating pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway and Toll and Imd signaling pathway. Based on the DEPs results, we speculate that inhibition of Hsp90 suppresses the BmNPV infection may because it could not only stimulate the host innate immune, induce small heat shock proteins expression to maintain the cellular proteostasis but activate host transcription factors to bind to virus DNA or protein and subsequently hinder virus replication. The results will help understand the roles of Hsp90 in BmNPV infection and shed light on new clue to illustrate the molecular mechanism of silkworm-virus interaction. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report on Hsp90 roles in BmNPV infection based on proteomic analysis. Our findings may provide new clue and research orientation to illustrate the molecular mechanism of silkworm-virus interaction and a set of BmHsp90 candidate clients, which may involve in BmNPV infection in BmN cells.",Sirt1 improves functional recovery by regulating autophagy of astrocyte and neuron after brain injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102754,Brain research bulletin,2019 06 15,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers neuronal death mechanisms that significantly induce neuronal loss and neurological dysfunction. Our previous study revealed that Sirt1 could improve the neuroprotective effect by reducing the astrocyte activation after TBI. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of Sirt1 attenuating astrocyte activation still remain unclear. The following study examined whether the protection of Sirt1 in nigrostriatal pathway injury is associated with autophagy regulation. We established a nigrostriatal pathway injury in the mouse brain in order to mimic the traumatic brain injury and up-regulated Sirt1 expression by resveratrol. Consequently, we analyzed the effect of Sirt1 up-regulation on LC3 and monitored the LC3 localization in the astrocytes, microglial cells and neurons. We found that the Sirt1 up-regulation by resveratrol increased the expression of LC3 around the lesion site after injury. Confocal results showed that Sirt1 up-regulation increased the expression of LC3 in astrocytes and decreased the expression in the neurons, while low effect was found on the microglial cells. Moreover, compared the resveratrol treatment groups, a typical nucleocytoplasmic localization with strong distribution in the nucleus (in astrocyte and neurons) was observed in the control group (treated with DMSO). To sum up, our data suggested that regulation of Sirt1 expression could enhance autophagy in the astrocytes and decrease the expression in the neurons. This mechanism, which may probably relate to the distribution of LC3 in cytoplasm and nucleus, provides a new theoretical basis for exploring the neuroprotective mechanism of Sirt1 after brain injury.",Potential role of P2X7 receptor in neurodegenerative processes in a murine model of glaucoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102752,Brain research bulletin,2019 06 15,"Glaucoma is a common cause of visual impairment and blindness, characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. The mechanisms that trigger the development of glaucoma remain unknown and have gained significant relevance in the study of this neurodegenerative disease. P2X7 purinergic receptors (P2X7R) could be involved in the regulation of the synaptic transmission and neuronal death in the retina through different pathways. The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular signals underlying glaucomatous retinal injury. The time-course of functional, morphological, and molecular changes in the glaucomatous retina of the DBA/2J mice were investigated. The expression and localization of P2X7R was analysed in relation with retinal markers. Caspase-3, JNK, and p38 were evaluated in control and glaucomatous mice by immunohistochemical and western-blot analysis. Furthermore, electroretinogram recordings (ERG) were performed to assess inner retina dysfunction. Glaucomatous mice exhibited changes in P2X7R expression as long as the pathology progressed. There was P2X7R overexpression in RGCs, the primary injured neurons, which correlated with the loss of function through ERG measurements. All analyzed MAPK and caspase-3 proteins were upregulated in the DBA/2J retinas suggesting a pro-apoptotic cell death. The increase in P2X7Rs presence may contribute, together with other factors, to the changes in retinal functionality and the concomitant death of RGCs. These findings provide evidence of possible intracellular pathways responsible for apoptosis regulation during glaucomatous degeneration.",Underlying mechanisms of recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated bicaudal C homolog 1 overexpression in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice with induced depressive-like behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102751,Brain research bulletin,2019 06 15,"Bicaudal C homolog 1 gene (BICC1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, less is known about the mechanisms of BICC1-induced depression. The purpose of the present study was to investigate changes in depressive-like behaviors induced by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated overexpression of BICC1 in the mPFC of mice. A viral-mediated genetic approach was employed to explore the BICC1 overexpression-induced depressive-like behavioral and molecular changes in mice. For the first time, we found that BICC1 overexpression significantly induced depressive-like behaviors in mice. Further, the expression of disheveled-2 and the phosphorylation of Ser9 of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and GluA1, GluA1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and VGF were markedly down-regulated in BICC1 overexpression-treated animals. Our results demonstrate that the overexpression of BICC1 in the mPFC may induce depressive-like behaviors via GSK3β/mTOR signaling and GluA1 trafficking in the mPFC of mice, indicating that BICC1 may be a potential target for antidepressant treatment.","Adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy is associated with decreased risk of incident atrial fibrillation compared to standard biventricular pacing: A real-world analysis of 37,450 patients followed by remote monitoring.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102750,Heart rhythm,2019 05 31,"The AdaptivCRT algorithm (aCRT) automatically adjusts atrioventricular delays each minute to achieve ventricular fusion through left ventricular (LV) or biventricular (BiV) pacing. aCRT is associated with superior clinical outcomes compared to standard BiV pacing, but the association of aCRT and subsequent atrial fibrillation (AF) in a real-world population has not been fully evaluated.",Quantifying length-dependent DNA end-binding by nucleoproteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102748,Biophysical chemistry,2019 06 06,"The ends of nucleic acids oligomers alter the statistics of interior nonspecific ligand binding and act as binding sites with altered properties. While the former aspect of ""end effects"" has received much theoretical attention in the literature, the physical nature of end-binding, and hence its potential impact on a wide range of studies with oligomers, remains poorly known. Here, we report for the first time end-binding to DNA using a model helix-turn-helix motif, the DNA-binding domain of ETV6, as a function of DNA sequence length. Spectral analysis of ETV6 intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by singular value decomposition showed that end-binding to nonspecific fragments was negligible at >0.2 kbp and accumulated to 8% of total binding to 23-bp oligomers. The affinity for end-binding was insensitive to salt but tracked the affinity of interior binding, suggesting translocation from interior sites rather than free solution as its mechanism. As the presence of a cognate site in the 23-bp oligomer suppressed end-binding, neglect of end-binding to the short cognate DNA does not introduce significant error. However, the same applies to nonspecific DNA only if longer fragments (>0.2 kbp) are used.",An acquired or heritable connective tissue disorder?

Research on hEDS continues to evolve but tangible progress will be realized when the growing body of evidence compliments clinical practice. This critical review of the literature aims to stimulate lateral thinking about the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of hEDS. The current international classification of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome introduced stricter diagnostic criteria for hEDS, which bore a blanket category (hypermobility spectrum disorders) for conditions presenting with symptomatic joint hypermobility, but do not match the hEDS diagnostic criteria. One would argue hEDS is another all-encompassing classification for heritable connective tissue disorders and or acquired musculoskeletal conditions without a definitive molecular basis. As scientific research progresses to accommodate validated and or annulled hypotheses, the plethora of unknowns in hEDS continue to challenge healthcare outcomes and care experiences."

The conventional single-target therapeutic approach might not always induce the desired effect owing to the multifactorial nature of PD. Hence, multitarget strategies have been proposed to simultaneously target multiple proteins involved in the development of PD.

The natural history and presentation are notable for cold abscesses causing mass effect, early or late neurological deficit, and kyphotic deformity of the spine caused by anterior vertebral body destruction. The disease can be diagnosed with laboratory studies and characteristic imaging findings, but tissue diagnosis with cultures, histology, and polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard. The cornerstone of medical management is multidrug chemotherapy to minimize relapse and drug resistance, and can be curative for spinal tuberculosis with minimal residual kyphosis.

As the population ages, the number of patients diagnosed with advanced heart failure and listed for transplant steadily increases annually. However, there remains a paucity of eligible DBD donor hearts which severely limits access to cardiac transplantation and leads to increasing wait-list times and avoidable patient mortalities. Though the first human heart transplant in 1967 was performed using a deceased donor heart, the advent of brain death criteria and the ability to avoid long warm ischemic times led DCD transplantation to fall out of favor. Due the current state of cardiac transplantation, there has been a resurgence in interest in DCD heart transplantation leading to the development of DCD heart transplantation programs in the UK and Australia after positive reports of successful DCD cardiac transplantation in the pediatric literature. These programs have demonstrated favorable post-transplantation outcomes equivalent to matched traditional DBD transplants with current techniques and strict donor criteria. This technique has been proven safe with favorable outcomes and has been demonstrated to significantly increase transplant volumes and decrease patient mortality.

We exposed zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan during the critical period of metamorphosis and somatic sex differentiation to determine effects on metamorphosis and reproduction. We use biological and morphological biomarkers to predict potential modes of action. Larval exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan was sufficient to cause adverse effects in adults and their offspring. TCS exposure delays metamorphosis and impairs fecundity and fertility. Offspring from TCS-exposed fish show decreased survival and delayed maturation, but their reproductive capacity is not altered. Delays in metamorphosis in conjunction with morphological indicators suggest that toxicity may result from lowered thyroid hormones in parental fish. This work illustrates the importance of evaluating the latent effects of early exposure to environmental contaminants, and that further studies to evaluate the effects of triclosan on the thyroid axis are warranted."

A systematic review of literature and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102706,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"Numerous studies have indicated that non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) of the cerebellum could modulate corticospinal excitability (CSE) in young healthy individuals. However, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis that clarifies the effects of cerebellar NIBS on CSE. The aim of this study was to provide a meta-analytic summary of the effects of cerebellar NIBS on CSE. Seven search engines were used to identify any trial evaluating CSE before and after one session of cerebellar NIBS in healthy individuals up to June 2018. Twenty-six studies investigating the corticospinal responses following cerebellar NIBS were included. Meta-analysis was used to pool the findings from included studies. Effects were expressed as mean differences (MD) and the standard deviation (SD). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool. Meta-analysis found that paired associative stimulation (PAS) with 2 ms interval, a combination of PAS with 21.5 ms interval and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with a frequency of < 5 Hz increase CSE (P PAS2 < 0.00001, P PAS21.5 +a-tDCS = 0.02, P rTMS = 0.04). However, continuous theta burst stimulation, a combination of PAS with 25 ms interval and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, and PAS with a 6 ms interval decreased CSE (P PAS6 < 0.00001, P cTBS < 0.00001, P PAS25 +a-tDCS = 0.003).

In this study, we assessed the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in mediating sevoflurane activation and whether the TRPV1 antagonist could prevent anesthesia-induced cell death. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of TRPV1 was increased after sevoflurane treatment, and pretreatment with TRPV1 antagonist SB366791 could attenuate the effect of sevoflurane on TRPV1 expression. Moreover, the inhibition of TRPV1 could prevent sevoflurane-induced cell death.

It is widely known that low Vitamin D can lead to increased renal renin and angiotensin II production, consequently elevating blood pressure or development of essential hypertension (EH). We have conducted an investigation on hypertensives and controls to evaluate the association of the gene variant, CYP24A1 rs2762939 and 25(OH)D in an Indian population with EH. On gender-based stratification, with multivariate logistic analysis after adjustment for covariates, the CYP24A1 rs2762939 CC variant showed a higher risk of EH in males (aOR = 3.141, CI 1.164-8.478, P = .024) while females illustrated an inverse association with EH (aOR = 0.398, CI 0.172-0.092, P = .031). The 25(OH)D levels among the three genotypes of hypertensives substantiate these results.

Recent use of nerve agents in Syria and the UK illustrate their continuous threat to the modern world. Epigenetic and autophagy studies are useful to address the issues related to regulation of gene and protein expression by which nerve agents could impact on human health. These studies help to understand molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple neurotoxic effects of nerve agents. In the present study, changes in epigenetic (global DNA methylation and histone acetylation) and autophagic marker proteins were studied in the nerve agent sensitive rat brain areas (piriform cortex and hippocampus) after soman (1xLD50) exposure. Global DNA methylation analysis revealed that nerve agent induced hypomethylation in the brain regions at 1 and 7 days post exposure. In contrast, DNA hypermethylation was observed at 30 days post soman exposure, demonstrating a possible compensatory mechanism. Western blot analysis showed significant increase in the histone acetylation levels after soman exposure in the piriform cortex and hippocampus. The present study observed the changes in autophagic proteins of nerve agent poisoning for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Immunoreactivity levels of autophagic proteins (LC3-II, ATG-5 and p62) were transiently increased in the rat piriform cortex and hippocampus after soman exposure. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the epigenetic and autophagic changes in the brain following soman exposure and their possible role in the neuronal damage and development of multiple neurological effects."

The structural properties were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, and 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy, which demonstrated that EMSC exhibited new ester linkages from citric acid in NMS. The in vitro digestibility results showed that EMSC had the significantly lower rapidly digestible starch contents and higher resistant starch contents compared to NMS. The properties of O/W pickering emulsion stabilized with NMS and EMSC were evaluated by microscopy, particle size, and zeta-potential. The results showed that the emulsion formed with EMSC had smaller particle size and improved stability than that formed with NMS.

Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) are somehow involved in Golgi stacking, which is relevant for its proper function, and also in unconventional protein secretion. However, the structural details on how GRASPs accomplish those tasks are still elusive. Here, we have explored the biochemical and biophysical properties of human full-length GRASP55 in solution. Sequence-based analyses and circular dichroism spectroscopy suggest that GRASP55 presents multiple intrinsically disordered sites, although keeping considerable contents of regular secondary structure. Size exclusion chromatography and multiple-angle light scattering show that GRASP55 are monomers in solution. Urea denaturation of GRASP55 suggests the transition to the unfolded state is a cooperative process. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis displays two endothermic transitions for GRASP55, indicating the existence of an intermediate state prior to unfolding. Thioflavin T fluorescence suggests GRASP55 intermediate can be aggregates/fibrils. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy prove GRASP55 forms large amorphous aggregates but not amyloid-like fibrils in the intermediate state. These results could be helpful in discussing the proper function of human GRASP55 in the Golgi organization as well as unconventional secretion of proteins.",In-situ fast gelling formulation for oral sustained drug delivery of paracetamol to dysphagic patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102679,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 15,"Evaluation of the potential for oral sustained drug delivery of formulations with in-situ gelling properties is the main objective of the present investigation.

This work investigated a nanocellulose fibrils reinforced CMCS composite hydrogel with giant network structure and quick gelation formability. The microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) with diameter in nano scale and length in sub-micron scale was obtained through high-pressure homogenization. The hydroxyl groups on the MFC nanofibrils surface were partly oxidized into aldehyde groups. The dialdehyde MFC (DAMFC), remaining the fibril morphology and fine three-dimensional network structure, was mixed with CMCS. Due to the Schiff-base reaction between the aldehyde groups on DAMFC surface and amino groups on CMCS chains, a giant network was formed in DAMFC/CMCS. As a result, CMCS composite hydrogel could be formed in short time, although pure CMCS could not form hydrogel. In the composite, DAMFC acted as a reinforcing agent as well as a macroscopical crosslinking agent. The structure and properties of the composite hydrogels were investigated. The compression strength and the work of fracture of the hydrogel was increased dramatically as the DAMFC content increasing from 5 to 15 wt%, an increase of 330% and 338%, respectively.

Acrylamide, furan and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed as heat-induced compounds produced mainly during thermal processing of foods. Dietary exposure was assessed for 705 representative children using food consumptions recorded through a 3-consecutive-days record. As all calculated margins of exposure (MOE) for PAHs exceeded 10 000, dietary exposure of the infant and toddler population was deemed tolerable with regard to the carcinogenic risk. Conversely, the exposure levels to acrylamide and furan were considered as of concern, requiring management measures to reduce the exposure essentially by reducing the formation of heat-induced compounds during food production or preparation processes. Efforts should mainly focus on major contributors to the exposure, i.e. sweet and savoury biscuits and bars, and potatoes and potato products for acrylamide, baby jars of vegetables, with or without meat or fish for acrylamide and furan."

The present study illustrated that during serum deprivation, Beclin1, a crucial gene that is essential for autophagosome formation in autophagy, gets controlled post-transcriptionally in breast cancer cell-line MCF-7. RNA affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the association of HuR with 3'-UTR of beclin1 mRNA. After cytosolic translocation, HuR enhances beclin1 protein synthesis in response to serum starvation by enhancing the association of beclin1 mRNA to the polysomes. Partial silencing of HuR resulted in reduction of beclin1 expression both at mRNA and protein levels, which in turn decreased starvation-induced autophagic flux. Thus, in conclusion, fine-tuning of beclin1 gene expression at post-transcriptional level by HuR is one of the key regulatory mechanisms of starvation induced autophagy in breast cancer cell-line, MCF-7.",In vitro and in vivo studies of the metabolic activation of chelidonine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102647,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 16,"Chelidonium majus L. is a herbal medicine widely employed in Europe and Western Asia. Chelidonine (CHE) is a major constituent of the herb and has been reported to be an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). The major objective of the present study was to study the metabolic pathways of CHE in order to identify potential reactive metabolites responsible for the enzyme inhibition. Three oxidative metabolites (M1-M3) were detected in human liver microsomal incubations after exposure to CHE. M1 and M2 were two isomers of catechol derivatives, and M3 was a dicatechol compound. The M1-M3 metabolites were also observed in bile of rats given CHE. A total of five glutathione (GSH) conjugates (M4-M8) were detected in microsomes containing CHE, GSH, and NADPH. Moreover, M4 and M6 originated from M1, M5 and M7 resulted from M2, and M8 was a M3-derived GSH conjugate. Three biliary CHE-derived GSH conjugates (M4, M5 and M8) were found in CHE-treated rats. This indicates that CHE was bioactivated to ortho-quinone derivatives both in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant P450 enzyme incubations demonstrated that the CYPs3A4, 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 were mainly involved in metabolic activation of CHE. This study generated data that may be useful in understanding possible mechanisms of CHE-induced P450 inhibition.",Impact of moderate versus deep sedation on adenoma detection rate in index average-risk screening colonoscopies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102644,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 05 18,"The debate between moderate sedation versus deep sedation for index average-risk screening colonoscopies is well known to gastroenterologists.

Nevertheless, and although some evidence exists about the effects of aerobic training on oxidative stress, there is scarce information concerning the effects of combined exercise training (aerobic and strength training) in oxidative stress. Considering this, the aim of this study was to verify the effects of a combined exercise training in oxidative stress parameters of women over 40 years of age. At baseline, 67 women enrolled in the study and were divided into three groups: younger group (YG, n = 28: 40 to 49 years), middle-aged group (MAG, n = 21: 50 to 59 years) and oldest group (OG, n = 18: above 60 years). These women engaged in a combined exercise training program for 16 weeks, 3 sessions of 60 min per week. At the end of the program, only 31 women (YG: 15; MAG: 8 and OG: 8) were remained in the study and were considered for analysis. Physical assessments (weight, height, body mass index and waist circumference), health and functional parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fitness tests: supine, latissimus, squat jump, 8 foot up and go test, 30 second chair stand test, and 6 min walk test) and measures of DNA damage (DNA SBs, DNA netFPG), lipid peroxidation (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and catalase activity (CAT) were performed before and after the 16-week intervention with combined exercise. The results showed an improvement of overall physical and functional performance as well as a significant decrease in waist perimeter and systolic blood pressure after the exercise program intervention. Regarding the biochemical measures, the exercise training induced a significant decrease in oxidative damage, and a significant increase in the TAC (p < 0.05). The results indicate that combined exercise training induces benefits in functional capacity and reduce damage caused by oxidative stress.",2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias: Executive summary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102616,Heart rhythm,2019 05 18,"Ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and come in a variety of forms, from single premature ventricular complexes to sustained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Rapid developments have taken place over the past decade in our understanding of these arrhythmias and in our ability to diagnose and treat them. The field of catheter ablation has progressed with the development of new methods and tools, and with the publication of large clinical trials. Therefore, global cardiac electrophysiology professional societies undertook to outline recommendations and best practices for these procedures in a document that will update and replace the 2009 EHRA/HRS Expert Consensus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias. An expert writing group, after reviewing and discussing the literature, including a systematic review and meta-analysis published in conjunction with this document, and drawing on their own experience, drafted and voted on recommendations and summarized current knowledge and practice in the field. Each recommendation is presented in knowledge byte format and is accompanied by supportive text and references. Further sections provide a practical synopsis of the various techniques and of the specific ventricular arrhythmia sites and substrates encountered in the electrophysiology lab.

To study the causes and progression of these diseases, multi-centre (MC) studies are conducted, with images acquired and analyzed from multiple institutions. Due to differences in acquisition software and hardware, there is variability in image properties, which creates challenges for automated algorithms. This work explores this variability, known as the MC effect, by analyzing nearly 5000 MC FLAIR volumes and proposes an intensity standardization framework to normalize intensity non-standardness in FLAIR MRI, while ensuring the appearance of WML. Results show that original image characteristics varied significantly between scanner vendors and centres, and that this variability was reduced with standardization. To further highlight the utility of intensity standardization, a threshold-based brain extraction algorithm is implemented and compared with a classifier-based approach. A competitive Dice Similarity Coefficient of 81% was achieved on 183 volumes, demonstrating that optimized pre-processing can effectively reduce the variability in MC studies, allowing for simplified algorithms to be applied on large datasets robustly."

As extinguished conditioned responding is prone to relapse under certain conditions, the necessity of memory consolidation for recovery phenomena to occur has been highlighted recently. Several studies have demonstrated that both acquisition and extinction training need to be properly consolidated for a relapse of the original acquired memory trace to occur. Does this imply that extinguished responses cannot relapse before memory consolidation? To answer this question, we investigated the renewal effect subsequent to an immediate or a delayed (24 h) extinction in a discriminative operant conditioning paradigm. In three different experiments, we could show (1) that acquisition learning does not need to be long-term consolidated for the occurrence of renewal, (2) that the offset of extinction training is a reliable marker for extinction recall in a free-operant extinction learning paradigm where organisms undergo consecutive acquisition training, extinction training as well as testing of conditioned responding and (3), that immediate and long-term consolidated renewal do not demonstrate any qualitative difference in terms of the behavioral output. Our results indicate on the behavioral level that the inhibitory nature of extinction is already present in free-operant learning paradigms and that it does not seem to be affected by the absence of long-term memory consolidation.",Social context influences sensorimotor gating in female African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102599,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 09,"Disruption in prepulse inhibition (PPI), a sensorimotor gating phenomenon found in many species, has been associated with various psychiatric disorders in humans. Social defeat has been identified as a mediator of naturally evoked reductions of PPI in African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni where males reversibly alter social status and their sensorimotor gating abilities. Here we investigated A. burtoni females, which establish a male-like social hierarchy with dominant (DOM) and subordinate (SUB) individuals when housed in communities without males. We asked if DOM and SUB females demonstrate socially induced PPI differences comparable to their male DOM and SUB counterparts. Results suggest that social defeat reduced PPI in SUB females as compared to DOM females (p = 0.033) and mixed-sex community female controls (p = 0.017). However, socially defeated females in same-sex communities remained proactive when engaging in antagonistic behaviors, which appears beneficial in avoiding substantial reductions in PPI as seen in reactive, socially defeated males. In open field swimming tests, SUB females exhibited increased anxiety-related behavior (thigmotaxis) as compared to females from mixed-sex communities (COM). Taken together, our results emphasize social defeat is a reliable modulator of PPI independent of sex, and anxiety related to social defeat might be a factor in mediating PPI plasticity.",Differential parietal activations for spatial remapping and saccadic control in a visual memory task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102598,Neuropsychologia,2019 06 16,"Remapping is a process that updates visual information in internal spatial representations across eye movements, allowing for stable perception of the environment. Previous work has demonstrated visual remapping activity in parietal cortex during saccades, but it remains unclear whether remapping is triggered by overt saccades only (or by attentional shifts also), and whether it engages parietal areas only (or other cortical areas). Here, we used fMRI to investigate spatial remapping during two visuospatial memory tasks requiring either overt (accompanied by a saccade) or covert (with central fixation) attention shifts to peripheral distracters. Participants had to remember the position and color of a lateralized dot during a saccade or attention shift, requiring them to update the dot position in memory, and then indicate if a second dot matched the first. Differential activation patterns were observed within parietal cortex as a function of the different visual, motor, and interhemispheric remapping demands in the saccade task, presumably mediating the maintenance of spatial position in perceptual and motor maps. Remapping engaged parietal areas adjacent to, but not overlapping with, those activated by saccade execution, while it did not engage the frontal eye fields, pointing to distinct neural substrates for ocular motor and spatial updating processes. No differential activation related to remapping was found during the covert attention shift task, suggesting that this condition did not necessitate the same remapping as the saccade condition. Overall these results further elucidate the mechanisms of spatial remapping in human parietal cortex and their relationship with attention processing and ocular motor behavior, with implications for understanding visuospatial attention deficits in hemispatial neglect.",Is sauna bathing protective of sudden cardiac death? A review of the evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102597,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2019 05 29,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a global public health burden accounting for 15-20% of all deaths. Though established atherosclerotic risk factors explain a large proportion of the risk of SCD, these factors are often absent in a large proportion of SCD victims and the pathogenesis of SCD is still not fully established. It therefore appears that additional factors may be involved. Sauna bathing is a traditional Finnish activity that is mainly used for the purposes of relaxation and pleasure. Beyond its use for these purposes, sauna bathing has been linked with several health benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that sauna bathing is associated with reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) and non-CVD outcomes as well as mortality. A number of reports have linked sauna bathing with reduced or increased risk of SCD, but the evidence is uncertain. This review summarizes available studies linking sauna bathing with SCD, the postulated mechanistic pathways underlying these associations, outlines areas of outstanding uncertainty, and the implications for prevention. We employed a comprehensive search for observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and non-RCTs from MEDLINE and Embase since their inception until March 2019. Observational data suggest that regular sauna bathing is associated with a substantial risk reduction in SCD. Furthermore, the data suggest that a combination of regular physical activity and sauna baths confers substantial risk reduction for SCD compared with either modality alone. Few reports have linked sauna baths with SCDs, but these single case incidents have been attributed to the effects of dehydration, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias due to a combination of sauna exposure and alcohol consumption. Sauna bathing is generally safe for most healthy people and even among patients with stable CVD, if used sensibly and with caution. Plausible pathways underlying the protective effect of sauna bathing on SCD may be linked to the impact on CV function via reduced arterial stiffness, decreases in inflammation and oxidative stress, stabilization of the autonomic nervous system, beneficial changes in circulating lipid profiles and other CVD risk markers, and lowering of systemic blood pressure. Sauna is a potential novel tool to promote SCD prevention in addition to other known means, being an enjoyable way to take care of general health and well-being.",Untargeted metabolic profiling of dogs with a suspected toxic mitochondrial myopathy using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102596,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 10,"'Go Slow myopathy' (GSM) is a suspected toxic myopathy in dogs that primarily occurs in the North Island of New Zealand, and affected dogs usually have a history of consuming meat, offal or bones from wild pigs (including previously frozen and/or cooked meat). Previous epidemiological and pathological studies on GSM have demonstrated that changes in mitochondrial structure and function are most likely caused by an environmental toxin that dogs are exposed to through the ingestion of wild pig. The disease has clinical, histological and biochemical similarities to poisoning in people and animals from the plant Ageratina altissima (white snakeroot). Aqueous and lipid extracts were prepared from liver samples of 24 clinically normal dogs and 15 dogs with GSM for untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Group-wise comparisons of mass spectral data revealed 38 features that were significantly different (FDR<0.05) between normal dogs and those with GSM in aqueous extracts, and 316 significantly different features in lipid extracts. No definitive cause of the myopathy was identified, but alkaloids derived from several plant species were among the possible identities of features that were more abundant in liver samples from affected dogs compared to normal dogs. Mass spectral data also revealed that dogs with GSM have reduced hepatic phospholipid and sphingolipid concentrations relative to normal dogs. In addition, affected dogs had changes in the abundance of kynurenic acid, various dicarboxylic acids and N-acetylated branch chain amino acids, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction.",Destination and consequences of Panx1 and mutant expression in polarized MDCK cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102595,Experimental cell research,2019 06 10,"The channel-forming membrane glycoprotein pannexin 1 (Panx1) is best characterized as an ATP release channel. To investigate the trafficking and sorting of Panx1, we used polarized MDCK cells and non-polarized BICR-M1Rk cells to track the fate of GFP-tagged Panx1. In non-polarized cells, Panx1 was found throughout the plasma membrane, including the lamellipodia of the tumor cells and the cell surface-targeting domain was mapped to residues 307-379. Panx1 was preferentially enriched at the apical membrane domain of polarized MDCK cells grown as monolayer sheets or as spheroids. Residual Panx1 localized within basolateral membranes of polarized MDCK cells was independent of a putative dileucine sorting motif LL365/6 found within the C-terminal of Panx1. Unexpectedly, stable expression of a Panx1 mutant, where a putative tyrosine-based basolateral sorting motif (YxxØ) was mutated (Y308F), or a truncated Δ379 Panx1 mutant, caused MDCK cells to lose cell-cell contacts and their ability to polarize as they underwent a switch to a more fibroblast-like phenotype. We conclude that Panx1 is preferentially delivered to the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells, and Panx1 mutants drive phenotypic changes to MDCK cells preventing their polarization.",The human Bcl-2 family member Bcl-rambo and voltage-dependent anion channels manifest a genetic interaction in Drosophila and cooperatively promote the activation of effector caspases in human cultured cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102594,Experimental cell research,2019 06 10,"We previously reported that the Bcl-2 family member human Bcl-rambo, also known as BCL2L13, induces apoptosis in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Mouse Bcl-rambo has recently been reported to mediate mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. In the present study, we showed that the transfection of human Bcl-rambo and its microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-interacting region motif mutant (W276A/I279A) caused mitochondrial fragmentation and the perinuclear accumulation of fragmented mitochondria in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. In comprehensive screening using the Drosophila model in which human Bcl-rambo was ectopically expressed in eye imaginal discs, voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), also known as mitochondrial porin, were found to manifest a genetic interaction with human Bcl-rambo. In addition to human adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) 1 and ANT2, the human Bcl-rambo protein bound to human VDAC1, albeit to a lesser extent than ANT2. Moreover, human VDAC1 and human VDAC2 in particular promoted the activation of effector caspases only when they were co-expressed with human Bcl-rambo in 293T cells. Bcl-rambo induced the perinuclear accumulation of fragmented mitochondria by the knockdown of VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 in A549 cells. Thus, the present study revealed that human Bcl-rambo and VDAC cooperatively promote the activation of effector caspases in human cultured cells.",Glucocorticoid receptor expression in the stress-limbic circuitry is differentially affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and adolescent stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102593,Brain research,2019 06 10,"The dense expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) within the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) mediates many aspects of emotional and stress regulation. Importantly, both prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and adolescent stress are known to induce emotional and stress dysregulation. Little is known, however, about how PAE and/or adolescent stress may alter the expression of GR in the amygdala, mPFC, and PVN. To fill this gap, we exposed PAE and control adolescent male and female rats to chronic mild stress (CMS) and assessed GR mRNA expression in the amygdala, mPFC, and PVN immediately following stress or in adulthood. We found that the effects of PAE on GR expression were more prevalent in the amygdala, while effects of adolescent stress on GR expression were more prevalent in the mPFC. Moreover, PAE effects in the amygdala were more pronounced during adolescence and adolescent stress effects in the mPFC were more pronounced in adulthood. GR expression in the PVN was affected by both PAE and adolescent stress. Finally, PAE and/or adolescent stress effects were distinct between males and females. Together, these results suggest that PAE and adolescent CMS induce dynamic alterations in GR expression in the amygdala, mPFC, and PVN, which manifest differently depending on the brain area, age, and sex of the animal. Additionally, these data indicate that PAE-induced hyperresponsiveness to stress and increased vulnerability to mental health problems may be mediated by different neural mechanisms depending on the sex and age of the animal.",Renal ischemia/reperfusion induced learning and memory deficit in the rat: insights into underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102592,Brain research,2019 05 18,"Distance organ dysfunction is the major cause of death in the patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the neurobiological basis of AKI-induced brain disorders and their mediators are poorly understood. This study was aimed to find out the links between AKI and brain injury and also the underlying cellular and electrophysiological mechanisms of memory deficit following induction of AKI via different experimental models of renal ischemia with or without uremia and uremia without renal ischemia. Fifty four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups that underwent 1-h bilateral or 2-h unilateral renal ischemia followed by 1-day reperfusion (BIR and UIR, respectively), and 1-day following bilateral nephrectomy (BNX) or sham-operation. There were 2 subgroups in each group, which blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity was evaluated in one subgroup. The other subgroup was used for recordings electrophysiological activities of the hippocampus; and after blood sampling and sacrificing animal, the cerebral hemispheres were removed and preserved for performing stereological study and Western-blotting of caspase-3 in the left and right hippocampus, respectively. Plasma urea and creatinine and CA1 neuronal loss were largely increased by BNX and BIR, but slightly by UIR. Apoptosis was stimulated in the hippocampus intensively by BIR but moderately by UIR and BNX. However, BIR and UIR were associated with profoundly disturbed BBB, increased CA1 neuronal excitability, impaired LTP induction and memory deficit. Therefore, AKI most likely through inflammatory mediators leads to hippocampal apoptosis and electrophysiological impairments, BBB disruption and memory loss, whereas uremia may contribute to necrotic neuronal death.",Multicolor lineage tracing using in vivo time-lapse imaging reveals coordinated death of clonally related cells in the developing vertebrate brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102591,Developmental biology,2019 05 27,"The global mechanisms that regulate and potentially coordinate cell proliferation & death in developing neural regions are not well understood. In particular, it is not clear how or whether clonal relationships between neural progenitor cells and their progeny influence the growing brain. We have developed an approach using Brainbow in the developing zebrafish to visualize and follow multiple clones of related cells in vivo over time. This allows for clear visualization of many dividing clones of cells, deep in proliferating brain regions. As expected, in addition to undergoing interkinetic nuclear migration and cell division, cells also periodically undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, cell death occurs in a non-random manner: clonally related cells are more likely to die in a progressive fashion than cells from different clones. Multiple members of an individual clone die while neighboring clones appear healthy and continue to divide. Our results suggest that clonal relationships can influence cellular fitness and survival in the developing nervous system, perhaps through a competitive mechanism whereby clones of cells are competing with other clones. Clonal cell competition may help regulate neuronal proliferation in the vertebrate brain."

We recorded a new population of Liolaemus eleodori, a lizard endemic to Argentina, parasitized by the hard tick Amblyomma parvitarsum. Hence, the objective of this study is to report this new association and enhance knowledge about its parasitism on reptiles of Argentina. To do this, we researched ectoparasitic loads. We determined different ecological predictors:
intensity, mean intensity and prevalence. Our results provide the first data on the parasitism of nymphal stages on this lizard. We found a tick prevalence of 91.6% and a mean intensity of 2.45. Considering sexes, mean intensity was higher in females than in males. The gular region and lower ventral abdomen were the highest parasitized anatomical regions. This new record of the host-parasite association suggests that this relationship is not accidental, with this lizard species being central to the tick’s life cycle. Probably, the microhabitat of this lizard species is essential for the tick to reach
high prevalence.

It is the core component of elastic fibers, which enable connective tissues such as those of the skin, lungs or blood vessels to stretch and recoil. This function is provided by elastin's exceptional properties, which mainly derive from a unique covalent cross-linking between hydrophilic lysine-rich motifs of units of the monomeric precursor tropoelastin. To date, elastin's cross-linking is poorly investigated. Here, we purified elastin from human tissue and cleaved it into soluble peptides using proteases with different specificities. We then analyzed elastin's molecular structure by identifying unmodified residues, post-translational modifications and cross-linked peptides by high-resolution mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The data revealed the presence of multiple isoforms in parallel and a complex and heterogeneous molecular interconnection. We discovered that the same lysine residues in different monomers were simultaneously involved in various cross-link types or remained unmodified. Furthermore, both types of cross-linking domains, Lys-Pro and Lys-Ala domains, participate not only in bifunctional inter- but also in intra-domain cross-links. We elucidated the sequences of several desmosine-containing peptides and the contribution of distinct domains such as 6, 14 and 25. In contrast to earlier assumptions proposing that desmosine cross-links are formed solely between two domains, we elucidated the structure of a peptide that proves a desmosine formation with participation of three Lys-Ala domains. In summary, these results provide new and detailed insights into the cross-linking process, which takes place within and between human tropoelastin units in a stochastic manner.",Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging prior to radical prostatectomy identifies intraductal and cribriform growth pattern of prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102571,BJU international,2019 05 18,"To evaluate the diagnostic value of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) prior to radical prostatectomy with curative intent for detection of cribriform architecture (CA) and intraductal prostate cancer (IDC), which have recently been demonstrated to be adverse pathologic factors.",Structure-dependent Activation of Gene Expression by Bis-indole and Quinoline-derived Activators of Nuclear Receptor 4A2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102570,Chemical biology & drug design,2019 06 10,"Bis-indole derivatives including 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)methane (DIM-C-pPhCl) and substituted quinolines such as chloroquine (CQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) are nuclear receptor 4A2 (NR4A2, Nurr1) ligands and they exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in mouse and rat models of Parkinson's disease, respectively. However, computational modeling demonstrates that the quinoline derivatives interact with the ligand binding domain whereas the bis-indoles preferentially interact with a C-terminal cofactor binding site of NR4A2. In this study, the effects of DIM-C-pPhCl and related analogs were compared to CQ/AQ as inducers of NR4A2-responsive genes including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), osteopontin (OPN), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropilin 1 (NRP1) in Panc1 and Panc28 pancreatic cancer cells. The results demonstrate that, among the bis-indole analogs, their relative potencies as inducers were structure-gene and cell context dependent. In contrast, CQ and AQ were significantly less potent than the bis-indole derivatives and, for some of the NR4A2-regulated genes, CQ and AQ were inactive as inducers. These results demonstrate that, although bis-indole and quinoline derivatives have been characterized as activators of NR4A2-dependent gene expression, these two classes of compounds exhibit different activities, indicating that they are selective NR4A2 modulators.

The nematode colonies are surrounded by nutritive tissues with promeristematic cells, capable of originating new emergences facing the larval chamber, and providing indeterminate growth to these galls. Considering enzyme activity as essential for the translocation of energetic molecules from the common storage tissue (CST) to the typical nutritive tissue (TNT), and the major occurrence of carbohydrates in nematode galls, it was expected that hormones mediate sink-strength relationships by activating enzymes in indeterminate-growth regions of the galls. (2) Histochemical, immunocytochemical and quantitative analyses were made in order to demonstrate sites of enzyme activity and hormones, and comparative levels of total soluble sugars, water soluble polysaccharides and starch. (3) The source-sink status, via carbohydrate metabolism, is controlled by the major accumulation of cytokinins in totipotent nutritive cells and new emergences. Thus, reducing sugars, as glucose and fructose, accumulate in the TNT, where they supply the energy for successive cycles of cell division and for nematodes feeding. The histochemical detection of phosphorylases and invertases activities indicate the occurrence of starch catabolism and sucrose transformation into reducing sugars, respectively, in the establishment of a gradient from the CST towards the TNT. Reducing sugars in the TNT are important for the production of new cell walls during the indeterminate growth of the galls, which have increased levels of water-soluble polysaccharides that corroborate such hypothesis. (4) Functional relationship between plant hormones accumulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell differentiation in D. gallaeformans induced-galls is attested, providing new insights on cell development and plant metabolism.

Even Pan Drug Resistant strains have been reported in some countries. The ICU mortality rate ranged from 45.6% to 60.9% and it is as high as 84.3% when ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was caused by XDR (Extensively drug-resistant) A. baumannii. A. baumannii constituted 9.4% of all gram-negative organisms throughout the hospital and 22.6% in the ICUs according to a study carried out in an Indian hospital. One of the major factors contributing to drug resistance in A. baumannii infections is biofilm development. Quorum sensing facilitates biofilm formation and therefore search for 'quorum quenchers' has increased recently. Such compounds are expected to inhibit biofilm formation and hence reduce/prevent development of drug resistance in the bacteria. Some of these compounds also target synthesis of some virulence factors. Several candidate drugs have been identified and are at various stages of drug development. Since quorum quenching, inhibition of biofilm formation and inhibition of virulence factors synthesis do not pose any threat to the DNA replication, cell division of the bacteria, chances of resistance development to such compounds is presumably rare. Thus these compounds ideally qualify as adjunct therapeutics and could be administered along with an antibiotic to reduce chances of resistance development and also to increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. This review describes the state-of-art in quorum sensing process in gram negative bacteria in general and in A. baumannii in particular. This article elaborates the nature of quorum sensing mediators, their characteristics, and the methods for their detection and quantitation. Various potential sites in the quorum sensing pathway have been highlighted as drug targets and the candidate quorum quenchers which inhibit the mediator's synthesis or function are enlisted.

EF deficits in obesity are associated with overeating and impulsive consumption of high calorie foods leading to excess weight gain and to problems with metabolic regulation and low-grade inflammation that detrimentally affect the structure and function of prefrontal cortex. Here, we test a complementary explanation for the relation between EF and body mass index (BMI) grounded in the energy demand of the developing brain. Recent work shows that the brain accounts for a lifetime peak of 66% of resting metabolic rate in childhood and that developmental changes in brain energetics and normative changes in body weight gain are closely inversely related. This finding suggests a trade-off in early childhood between energy used to support brain development versus energy used to support physical growth and fat deposition. To test this theorized energetic trade-off, we analyzed data from a large longitudinal sample (N = 1,292) and found that change in EF from age 3 to 5 years, as a proxy for brain development in energetically costly prefrontal cortex, is inversely related to change in BMI from age 2 to 5 years. Greater linear decline in BMI predicted greater linear increase in EF. We interpret this finding as tentative support for a brain-body energetic trade-off in early childhood with implications for lifetime obesity risk.",Intra-abdominal infections in solid organ transplant recipients: Guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102546,Clinical transplantation,2019 05 18,"This new guideline from the AST IDCOP reviews intra-abdominal infections (IAI), which cause substantial morbidity and mortality among abdominal SOT recipients. Each transplant type carries unique risks for IAI, though peritonitis occurs in all abdominal transplant recipients. Biliary infections, bilomas, and intraabdominal and intrahepatic abscesses are common after liver transplantation and are associated with the type of biliary anastomosis, the presence of vascular thrombosis or ischemia, and biliary leaks or strictures. IAI after kidney transplantation include renal and perinephric abscesses and graft-site candidiasis, which is uncommon but may require allograft nephrectomy. Among pancreas transplant recipients, duodenal anastomotic leaks can have catastrophic consequences, and polymicrobial abscesses can lead to graft loss and death. Intestinal transplant recipients are at the highest risk for sepsis, infection due to multidrug-resistant organisms, and death from IAI, as the transplanted intestine is a contaminated, highly immunological, pathogen-rich organ. Source control and antibiotics are the cornerstone of the management of IAIs. Empiric antimicrobial regimens should be tailored to local susceptibility patterns and pathogens which the patient is known to be colonized, with subsequent optimization once the results of cultures are reported.

Fourteen amphibian skin peptides and twelve analogues of temporin-1DRa were studied for their antimicrobial activities against clinically relevant human or animal skin infection-associated pathogens. For comparison, antimicrobial potencies of frog skin peptides against a range of probiotic lactobacilli were determined. We used the VITEK 2 system to define a profile of antibiotic susceptibility for the bacterial panel. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the naturally occurring temporin-1DRa, CPF-AM1, alyteserin-1c, hymenochirin-2B, and hymenochirin-4B for pathogenic bacteria were 3- to 9-fold lower than the values for the tested probiotic strains. Similarly, temporin-1DRa and its [Lys4 ], [Lys5 ] and [Aib8 ] analogues showed 5- to 6.5-fold greater potency against the pathogens. In the case of PGLa-AM1, XT-7, temporin-1DRa and its [D-Lys8 ] and [Aib13 ] analogues, no apoptosis or necrosis was detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at concentrations below or above the MIC.

Given inconsistencies in modes of assessment and difficulties in attribution to SLE, the reported prevalence of CD ranges from 5-80%. While clinical studies of SLE-related CD have been hampered by heterogeneous subject populations and a lack of sensitive and standardized cognitive batteries or other validated objective biomarkers for CD, there are nonetheless strong data from mouse models and from the clinical arena that CD is related to known disease mechanisms. Several cytokines, inflammatory molecules and antibodies have been associated with CD. Proposed mechanisms for antibody and cytokine-mediated neuronal injury include abrogation of blood-brain barrier integrity with direct access of soluble molecules in the circulation to the brain and ensuing neurotoxicity and microglial activation. No treatments for SLE-mediated CD exist, but potential candidates include agents that inhibit microglial activation such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or protect blood brain barrier integrity such as C5a receptor blockers. Structural and functional neuroimaging data have shown a range of regional abnormalities in metabolism and white matter microstructural integrity in SLE patients that correlate with CD and could in the future become diagnostic tools, as well as outcome measures in clinical trials aimed at preserving cognitive function in SLE.

This paper describes CF practices in 2034 children aged 6-23 months, and investigates their relationships with length-for-age z-score (LAZ) and stunting, using cross-sectional data collected from May to July 2014 in rural northern Togo. The WHO Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) indicators were computed, along with ancillary indicators on feeding style and timing of introduction of complementary foods. The associations between those indicators and children's LAZ and stunting were assessed using linear and logistic regressions, after stratification by age group and adjustment for children, maternal and household characteristics. CF practices were suboptimal and their associations with child's growth varied across indicators and age groups. In children aged 6-11 months, reaching the Minimum Dietary Diversity and the Minimum Acceptable Diet was associated with higher LAZ (p<0.05). In 18-23 month-old children, only the consumption of iron-rich food was associated with both LAZ (p=0.02) and stunting (p=0.05). The late introduction of family foods was associated with higher odds of being stunted and lower LAZ in children aged 12-17 months (p<0.001). The untimely introduction of porridge was associated with higher odds of stunting in children aged 9-23 months (p<0.05). Unexpectedly, helping the child to eat was negatively associated with linear growth in all age groups.

The appearance of triggers of DIC, such as damage-associated molecular patterns, inflammatory cytokines, and adrenaline, is associated with platelet activation, marked thrombin generation and fibrin formation, insufficient anticoagulation pathways, and increased fibrinolysis by tissue-type plasminogen activator, followed by the suppression of fibrinolysis by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, in patients with cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Simultaneous neutrophil activation and endothelial injury associated with glycocalyx perturbation have been observed in these patients. The degree of these changes is more severe in patients with prolonged precardiac arrest hypoxia and long no-flow and low-flow times, patients without return of spontaneous circulation, and non-survivors. Animal and clinical studies have confirmed decreased cerebral blood flow and microvascular fibrin thrombosis in vital organs, including the brain. The clinical diagnosis of DIC in patients with cardiac arrest and resuscitation is associated with multiple organ dysfunction, as assessed with the sequential organ failure assessment score, and increased mortality. This review confirms that the coagulofibrinolytic changes in cardiac arrest and resuscitation meet the definition of DIC proposed by the ISTH, and that DIC is associated with organ dysfunction and poor patient outcomes. This evidence implies that established DIC should be considered to be one of the main therapeutic targets in post-cardiac arrest syndrome.",Inhibition of mTOR by Rapamycin Aggravates Corneal Epithelial Stem Cell Deficiency by Upregulating Inflammatory Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102490,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2019 05 30,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is critical to the regulation of stem cell maintenance and function in a cell-type and context-dependent manner. However, the effects of mTOR signaling on corneal epithelial stem cells (CESCs) under inflammatory conditions are not clear. Here, we demonstrate that mTOR inhibition with rapamycin promotes apoptosis of CESCs in a mouse model of sterile inflammation-induced CESC deficiency, and thereby aggravates the disease. Apoptosis induction in CESCs by rapamycin is not due to direct effect of rapamycin on the cells, but mediated by increase in neutrophilic inflammation. The interleukin (IL)-10/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 anti-inflammatory pathway was downregulated in a Toll-like receptor 2-independent manner after rapamycin treatment and IL-10 replenishment abrogated the effects of rapamycin on inflammation and CESC apoptosis. Hence, our data reveal that the mTOR signaling is implicated in the control of the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory balance in the cornea and that mTOR inhibition with rapamycin is detrimental to CESCs by accelerating inflammation-induced collateral damage to the cells.

Accelerometers capture mechanical work, while oxygen uptake captures the energy cost of this work. Frequency filtering needs to be considered when processing acceleration data. A too restrictive filter attenuates the acceleration signal for walking and, to a higher degree, for running. This measurement error affects shorter (children) more than taller (adults) individuals due to their higher movement frequency. Less restrictive filtering includes more movement-related signals and provides measures that better capture mechanical work, but may include more noise. An optimal filter cut-point is determined where most relevant acceleration signals are included. Further, accelerometer placement affects what part of mechanical work being captured. While the waist placement captures total mechanical work and therefore contributes to measures of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature, the thigh and wrist placements capture more internal work and do not provide equivalent measures. Value calibration of accelerometer measures is usually performed using measured oxygen uptake with the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) as reference measure of activity intensity. However, the use of MET is not stringent and is not a measure of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature. A candidate measure is the mass-specific net oxygen uptake, VO2 net (VO2 tot - VO2 stand). To improve measurement of physical activity intensity using accelerometers, research developments are suggested concerning the processing of accelerometer data, use of energy expenditure as reference for activity intensity, and calibration procedure with absolute versus relative intensity.",An in vitro investigation into the effects of 10 Hz cyclic loading on tenocyte metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102473,Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2019 06 03,"Tendinopathy is a prevalent, highly debilitating condition, with poorly defined etiology. A wide range of clinical treatments has been proposed, with systematic reviews largely supporting shock wave therapy or eccentric exercise. Characterizing these treatments have demonstrated both generate perturbations within tendon at a frequency of approximately 8-12 Hz. Consequently, it is hypothesized that loading in this frequency range initiates increased anabolic tenocyte behavior, promoting tendon repair. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 10 Hz perturbations on tenocyte metabolism, comparing gene expression in response to a 10 Hz and 1 Hz loading profile. Tenocytes from healthy and tendinopathic human tendons were seeded into 3D collagen gels and subjected to 15 minutes cyclic strain at 10 Hz or 1 Hz. Tenocytes from healthy tendon showed increased expression of all analyzed genes in response to loading, with significantly increased expression of inflammatory and degradative genes with 10 Hz, relative to 1 Hz loading. By contrast, whilst the response of tenocytes from tendinopathy tendon also increased with 10 Hz loading, the overall response profile was more varied and less intense, possibly indicative of an altered healing response. Through inhibition of the pathway, IL1 was shown to be involved in the degradative and catabolic response of cells to high-frequency loading, abrogating the loading response. This study has demonstrated for the first time that loading at a frequency of 10 Hz may enhance the metabolic response of tenocytes by initiating an immediate degradatory and inflammatory cell response through the IL1 pathway, perhaps as an initial stage of tendon healing.",Cardiorespiratory fitness as a predictor of short-term and lifetime estimated cardiovascular disease risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102472,Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2019 06 07,"Development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a public health concern for young to middle-aged adults, now exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) improves the reclassification of short-term (10-year) CVD risk, but has not been uniformly defined across studies. This study evaluated cross-sectional differences in short-term and lifetime CVD risk scores, across both absolute metabolic equivalent (MET) and sex- and age-standardized CRF categories in 805 apparently healthy young to middle-aged adults (68% male; 47.4 ± 7.2 years). CVD risk factors were evaluated, and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measurements (METS and peak VO2 ) were derived from a submaximal Bruce treadmill test. CRF measures also included post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) data. Consistent trends showing more favorable risk factor profiles and lower short-term CVD (QRISK2), and CVD mortality (SCORE) scores, associated with higher levels of CRF were evident in both sexes. Lifetime CVD risk (Q-Lifetime) was highest in the lowest CRF categories. Peak VO2 and HRR following submaximal exercise testing contributed to the variability in short-term and lifetime CVD risk. Global CVD risk predictions were examined across different contemporary CRF classifications with inconsistent findings. Recommended absolute MET and sex- and age-standardized CRF categories were significantly associated with both short-term and lifetime risk of CVD outcomes. However, compared to internationally derived normative CRF standards, cohort-specific CRF categories resulted in markedly different proportion of individuals classified in the ""poor"" CRF category at higher CVD risk.",Lecanicillium aphanocladii: snake venom phospholipases A2 and proteases as tools to prospect enzymatic inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102470,Letters in applied microbiology,2019 05 18,"Natural enzyme inhibitors have been widely described in literature because of its pharmacological and cosmetic applications. Fungi found in caves represent a promising source of bioactive substances that are still little explored scientifically. Thus, the present work evaluated the presence of enzymatic modulators in a filtrate obtained from the cultivation of the cave fungus Lecanicillium aphanocladii (Family: Cordycipitaceae). Snake venoms from Bothrops alternatus and Bothrops atrox were used as an enzymatic source for the induction of the phospholipase, proteolytic, thrombolytic, cytotoxic, and coagulant activities. Compounds present in the fungal filtrate inhibited 50%, 23·8%, 26·6%, 50·9%, and 52·5% of the proteolytic, phospholipase, hemolytic, thrombolytic, and coagulant activities, respectively. The filtrate was not cytotoxic on erythrocytes, but induced partial dissolution of thrombi. Fungal enzyme inhibitors that have low or no toxicity and can be obtained on a large scale and at low cost are relevant in the medical-scientific context. Therefore, the inhibition of phospholipases A2 and proteases observed in the present work highlights the potential of fungal metabolites for the development of drugs that can be used in the treatment of hemostasis and inflammation-related disorders.

Emergence of genetic structure and loss of allelic variation in natural populations is not as evident as expected from demographic trends. Restored populations show genetic variation comparable to their source populations and, in general, to the wild ones. Genetic homogeneity is observed in regeneration trials, although some alleles not captured in source populations are detected. We infer that polyploidy, longevity and clonal reproduction have provided P. vulgaris with the standing genetic variation necessary to make the species resilient to the effects of demographic decline, suggesting that the use of multiple sources for reintroduction may be beneficial to mimic natural gene flow and the availability of multiple allele copies typical of polyploid species.",Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis of Treatment Interruptions in HIV-1 Infected Patients Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy: Implications for Future HIV Cure Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102444,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 05 18,Safety and tolerability of analytical treatment interruptions (ATIs) as a vital part of HIV-1 cure studies are discussed.

Three mtDNA haplotypes were identified from South China tigers sampled in this study, including a unique P. t. amoyensis AMO1 haplotype not found in other subspecies, a COR1 haplotype that is widespread in Indochinese tigers (P. t. corbetti), and an ALT haplotype that is characteristic of Amur tigers (P. t. altaica).

This parallel double blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial was comprised of 15 transcranial direct current stimulation visits and 7 follow-up visits. Participants were over the age of 18, had a burn injury that occurred at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment, and reported having pain and/or itch that was moderate to severe in intensity. A total of 31 subjects were randomized into either an active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, race, education, baseline depression, or anxiety. The median dropout time was at visit 19 [visit 16 (SE=1.98) for the sham group and visit 19 (SE=1.98) for the active group].

Since near 50% of burn victims test positive for blood-alcohol-levels at hospital admission and have inferior outcomes compared to non-intoxicated burn-patients; we hypothesized that the gastrointestinal hormone secretion is compromised in intoxicated burn victims. To test our theory, we quantified gastrointestinal hormones serum levels in a combine ethanol-intoxication and burn injury mouse model. Thus, mice received a daily dose of ethanol for three days, rested four days, and were given ethanol three additional days. Mice underwent fifteen-percent total-body-surface-area (TBSA) scald burn thirty minutes after their last ethanol dose. Serum samples were collected 24 hours after burn injury. Non-intoxicated burned mice exhibited an increase in glucose, insulin, ghrelin, plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), leptin and resistin by 1.4-, 3-, 13.5-, 6.2-, 9.4-, and 2.4-fold respectively compared to sham vehicle mice (p<0.05). Burn injury also reduced serum gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) by 32% compared to sham-injured, vehicle-treated mice. Leptin, resistin, glucagon-like-peptide (GLP-1), as well as insulin, were not different from sham groups when intoxication preceded burn-injury. Nevertheless, in burned mice treated with ethanol, GIP and glucagon serum levels exhibited a significant fold increase of 3.5 and 4.7 respectively. With these results, we conclude that twenty-four hours after burn injury, mice developed significant changes in gastrointestinal hormones, along with hyperglycemia. Moreover, the combined insult of burn and ethanol intoxication led to additional hormonal changes that may be attributed to a potential pancreatic dysfunction. Further multi-day studies are required to investigate the etiology, behavior and clinical significance of these hormonal changes.",Advances in Sensor Monitoring Effectiveness and Applicability: A Systematic Review and Update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102436,The Gerontologist,2019 05 18,To provide an updated review article studying the applicability and effectiveness of sensor networks in measuring and supporting activities of daily living (ADLs) among non-demented older adults.,Insulin Resistance and Renal Sodium Handling Influence Arterial Stiffness in Hypertensive Patients with Prevailing Sodium Intake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102435,American journal of hypertension,2019 05 18,Insulin resistance and renal tubular sodium handling influence arterial structure and function and play an essential role in salt-sensitive forms of hypertension.,Regulation of erythrocyte function: Multiple evolutionary solutions for respiratory gas transport and its regulation in fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102432,"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",2019 06 06,"Gas transport concepts in vertebrates have naturally been formulated based on human blood. However, the first vertebrates were aquatic, and fish and tetrapods diverged hundreds of millions years ago. Water-breathing vertebrates live in an environment with low and variable O2 levels, making environmental O2 an important evolutionary selection pressure in fishes, and various features of their gas transport differ from humans. Erythrocyte function in fish is of current interest, because current environmental changes affect gas transport, and because especially zebrafish is used as a model in biomedical studies, making it important to understand the differences in gas transport between fish and mammals to be able to carry out meaningful studies. Of the close to thirty thousand fish species, teleosts are the most species-numerous group. However, two additional radiations are discussed: agnathans and elasmobranchs. The gas transport by elasmobranchs may be closest to the ancestors of tetrapods. The major difference in their haemoglobin (Hb) function to humans is their high urea tolerance. Agnathans differ from other vertebrates by having Hbs, where cooperativity is achieved by monomer-oligomer equilibria. Their erythrocytes also lack the anion exchange pathway with profound effects on CO2 transport. Teleosts are characterized by highly pH sensitive Hbs, which can fail to become fully O2 -saturated at low pH. An adrenergically stimulated Na+ /H+ exchanger has evolved in their erythrocyte membrane, and plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase can be differentially distributed among their tissues. Together, and differing from other vertebrates, these features can maximize O2 unloading in muscle while ensuring O2 loading in gills."

To investigate the impact of TP53 on the metabolic activation of 1-HMP, a panel of isogenic human colorectal HCT116 cells having TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-), or TP53(-/-) were treated with 10 μM 1-HMP for 24 hr. 1-HMP-DNA adduct formation was determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, which quantified two nucleoside adducts N2 -(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine and N6 -(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine. 1-HMP treatment resulted in significantly (~40-fold) higher DNA adduct levels in TP53(+/+) cells than in the other cell lines. Higher levels of 1-HMP-induced DNA adducts in TP53(+/+) cells correlated with higher basal expression of SULT1A1/3 in this cell line, but 1-HMP treatment showed no effect on the expression of this protein.

Previous studies showed that rat OATP1A1 (rOATP1A1) has a PDZ consensus binding motif at its C-terminus and binds to PDZK1 which is required for its cell surface localization. PDZK1 associates with rOATP1A1-containing endocytic vesicles within cells, mediating recruitment of motor proteins required for microtubule-based trafficking to the plasma membrane. rOATP1A4 also traffics to the plasma membrane although it lacks a PDZ binding consensus sequence. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that trafficking of rOATP1A4 to the plasma membrane requires its direct interaction with rOATP1A1 resulting in a complex that traffics through the cell in common subcellular vesicles in which the cytosolic tail of rOATP1A1 is bound to PDZK1. We found that 74% of rOATP1A4-containing rat liver endocytic vesicles (n=12,044) also contained rOATP1A1. Studies in transfected HEK293 cells showed surface localization of rOATP1A1 only when coexpressed with PDZK1 while rOATP1A4 required coexpression with rOATP1A1 and PDZK1. Studies in stably transfected HeLa cells that constitutively expressed PDZK1 showed that co-expression of rOATP1A4 with rOATP1A1 resulted in more rapid appearance of rOATP1A4 on the plasma membrane and faster maturation to its fully glycosylated form. Similar results were seen on immunofluorescence analysis of single cells. Immunoprecipitation of rat liver or transfected HeLa cell lysates with rOATP1A1 antibody specifically co-immunoprecipitated rOATP1A4 as determined by Western blot. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that optimal rOATP1A4 trafficking to the cell surface is dependent upon co-expression and interaction with rOATP1A1. As rOATP1A1 binds to the chaperone protein PDZK1, rOATP1A4 functionally hitchhikes through the cell with this complex. This article is protected by copyright.

However, most research on SD suffers theoretical and methodological problems that fail to account for how its cognitive and linguistic aspects can be reconciled. We know little about SD as it occurs in interactional settings. Utilizing a conversation analytic (CA) perspective that brackets cognitive explanations for linguistic phenomena, this paper draws on more than 100 hours of transcribed recordings of interactions from diverse settings to systematically examine the form and function of a common class of SD: critical comments by a speaker on their current talk or actions (self-deprecatory meta-comments; SDMCs). Analyses demonstrate that SDMCs are used in environments of possible or actual interactional trouble, and manage this trouble in different sequential positions. The paper shows that SDs can be treated as a communication practice. Rigorous analysis of SDMCs can enrich understanding of the construction of 'identities' in talk. It advances a CA understanding of the ascription of social actions, and the preference for self-criticism over criticism by others. Findings suggest that widespread advice to self-deprecate less may be invalid.",Effects of trisodium phosphate treatment after harvest on storage quality and sucrose metabolism in jujube fruit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102411,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 05 18,"Trisodium phosphate (TSP), a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substance, could control postharvest diseases and maintain fruit quality.

Gluteal augmentation is designed to increase the volume and contour of the gluteal region. Intramuscular lipoinjection has been linked to multiple reports of severe complications, including death due to macro fat embolism (MAFE). The authors present the first reported case of survival and successful recovery after MAFE secondary to gluteal augmentation with fat. A 41-year-old woman, ASA II, was scheduled to have augmentation mammaplasty, liposuction, and gluteal augmentation with fat. The patient was operated under general anesthesia with a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique. A total of 3.5 liters of fat were liposuctioned with no complications. The patient was then positioned in a lateral decubitus position for gluteal augmentation with fat. Right after the last injection, the anesthesiologist noticed a sudden change in capnography followed by hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoxemia. The first reaction in the operating room was to consider that the patient was experiencing a severe episode of fat embolism. She was then resuscitated and transferred to a tertiary facility for intensive care management. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of successful resuscitation in a patient experiencing severe MAFE after gluteal augmentation with fat. We believe that this patient survived the event due to early detection, aggressive management, and proper transfer to an intensive care unit.","Contribution of congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) to permanent hearing loss in a highly seropositive population: ""The BraCHS study"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102409,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 05 18,The exact contribution of congenital CMV infection (cCMV) to congenital and early-onset permanent hearing loss in highly seropositive populations is unknown.,Serum metabolic signatures of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102408,European heart journal,2019 05 18,To characterize serum metabolic signatures associated with atherosclerosis in the coronary or carotid arteries and subsequently their association with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods:Escherichia coli (E. coli) was inoculated into uterine cervix of pregnant rats with gestation of 15 d to establish the intrauterine infection model, and the effect on the delivery of pregnant rats was observed. The neonatal rat brain tissue was stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin and the cerebral white matter damage was assessed. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and neurofilament (NF) in pup brains. Birth weight and early growth development indices were monitored,and neurobehavioral tests were performed to access the change of neurobehavioral development in neonatal rats. Results:The white blood cell count increased significantly in the uterus and placenta of the pregnant rats after intrauterine E. coli infection and no significant impact was observed on the delivery of pregnant rats. Weak staining and focal rarefaction of cerebral white matter from rats at P7 in intrauterine infection group were observed. The expression of GFAP markedly increased (P<0.05) in infection group, while the level of CNPase and NF in pup brains at P7 significantly decreased (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Previous research has begun to examine the relationship between verbal abilities and emotional and behavioral problems (EBP). The current study compared parent-reported EBP in children of differing language levels on two instruments commonly used in ASD research and clinical practice, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). The study consisted of 1,937 6-18 years old children with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection. Children were divided into three language groups, by ADOS module (Module 1 = MV, 2 = phrase speech (PS), and 3 = verbally fluent (VF)) and then compared on CBCL and ABC subscales. The ABC and CBCL showed different patterns of elevations across the language groups. MV children were reported to have more impairment than VF children on the ABC irritability, lethargy, and hyperactivity scales. Children with less language (MV and PS) exhibited less impairment on the CBCL internalizing domain than VF children, but did not differ on the externalizing domain. Post hoc comparisons showed that internalizing differences were driven by fewer children with less language exhibiting clinically elevated anxious/depressed scores compared to VF children. The present study underscores the significance of considering language when assessing EBP. Results have implications for the psychiatric screening of children with ASD, particularly those with language impairments. Researchers should exercise caution when applying EBP instruments designed for use with different populations and purposes to broad samples of children.

The present study found that there was a tendency for children with language impairment to have lower internalizing scores on the Child Behavior Checklist, but higher scores lethargy and irritability scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, relative to verbally fluent children.

This paper describes a 3D navigation system for the accurate targeting of the fenestration site, then reports results of an ex-vivo study to assess whether the laser operative conditions, which ensure the fabric fenestration, are harmless for the biological tissue surrounding the endoprosthesis. 225 samples of human aorta, including healthy specimens and abdominal aortic aneurysm samples, were irradiated ex-vivo using a 810 nm diode laser. Energy and pulse duration were varied. Irradiated tissues were fixed in formaldehyde, sectioned and subjected to histological examination. Only 7.5% of the irradiated samples exhibited a thermal damage, which was always confined to the contact point between the laser fiber tip and the aortic wall.

In this review, we describe how developmental processes associated with stem-cell-driven growth of tissue in both the embryonic and adult nervous system can be modeled using cellular automata (CA). A cellular automaton is defined by its discrete nature in time, space, and state. The discrete space is represented by a uniform grid or lattice containing agents that interact with other agents within their local neighborhood. This possibility of local interactions of agents makes the cellular automata approach particularly well suited for studying through modeling how complex patterns at the tissue level emerge from fundamental developmental processes (such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death) at the single-cell level. As part of this review, we provide a primer for how to define biologically inspired rules governing these processes so that they can be implemented into a CA model. We then demonstrate the power of the CA approach by presenting simulations (in the form of figures and movies) based on building models of three developmental systems: the formation of the enteric nervous system through invasion by neural crest cells; the growth of normal and tumorous neurospheres induced by proliferation of adult neural stem/progenitor cells; and the neural fate specification through lateral inhibition of embryonic stem cells in the neurogenic region of Drosophila.",Increased Cthrc1 expression in primary biliary cholangitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102333,Journal of digestive diseases,2019 05 18,"Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (Cthrc1) is a highly conserved extracellular matrix glycoprotein that overexpresses in two murine models of cholestatic liver fibrosis.

To attain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis for this switch, we performed untargeted lipidomic and proteomic liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on eggs and larvae from three sea urchin species: the lecithotroph Heliocidaris erythrogramma, the closely related planktotroph Heliocidaris tuberculata, and the distantly related planktotroph Lytechinus variegatus. We identify numerous molecular-level changes possibly associated with the evolution of lecithotrophy in H. erythrogramma. We find the massive lipid stores of H. erythrogramma eggs are largely composed of low-density, diacylglycerol ether lipids that, contrary to expectations, appear to support postmetamorphic development and survivorship. Rapid premetamorphic development in this species may instead be powered by upregulated carbohydrate metabolism or triacylglycerol metabolism. We also find proteins involved in oxidative stress regulation are upregulated in H. erythrogramma eggs, and apoB-like lipid transfer proteins may be important for echinoid oogenic nutrient provisioning. These results demonstrate how mass spectrometry can enrich our understanding of life history evolution and organismal diversity by identifying specific molecules associated with distinct life history strategies and prompt new hypotheses about how and why these adaptations evolve.",Meiotic gene activation in somatic and germ cell tumours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102330,Andrology,2019 05 18,"Germ cell tumours are uniquely associated with the gametogenic tissues of males and females.

For many of these compounds, the specific bioactivities are unknown. One common challenge in natural product research when trying to prioritize research efforts is the rediscovery of identical (or highly similar) compounds from different strains. Linking genome sequence to metabolite production can help in overcoming this problem. However, sequences are typically not available for entire collections of organisms. Here, we perform a comprehensive metabolic screening using HPLC-MS data associated with a 114-strain collection (58 Photorhabdus and 56 Xenorhabdus) across Thailand and explore the metabolic variation among the strains, matched with several abiotic factors. We utilize machine learning in order to rank the importance of individual metabolites in determining all given metadata. With this approach, we were able to prioritize metabolites in the context of natural product investigations, leading to the identification of previously unknown compounds. The top three highest ranking features were associated with Xenorhabdus and attributed to the same chemical entity, cyclo(tetrahydroxybutyrate). This work also addresses the need for prioritization in high-throughput metabolomic studies and demonstrates the viability of such an approach in future research.","Gender differences among medical students, house staff, and faculty physicians at high risk for suicide: A HEAR report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102314,Depression and anxiety,2019 05 18,"In comparison with the general population, physicians, and physicians-in-training are at greater risk for suicide.

Felids are capable of serving as both intermediate and definite hosts for T. gondii infection. However, there is no direct evidence to prove that servals are the intermediate host of T. gondii. In this study, T. gondii antibodies were detected in a serval by a modified agglutination test (titer, 1:200). Viable T. gondii was isolated from the striated muscles of the serval. This strain was further propagated in cell culture and designated as TgServalCHn1. Genetic characterization of DNA derived from cell culture was performed by RFLP-PCR of 10 markers, as well as polymorphic ROP5 and ROP18 genes. Results showed that this strain of T. gondii belonged to the genotype ToxoDB#20. The ROP5 allele 4 and ROP18 allele 3 suggested that this strain was avirulent, which was further supported by infection in mice. Encephalitis, immune organ necrosis and focal mononuclear cell infiltration in multiple organs were the main pathology characteristics observed in BALB/C mice infected with the TgServalCHn1 strain. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the isolation of T. gondii from a serval, which gives direct evidence for servals serving as an intermediate host of T. gondii.

Dehydration proteins (dehydrins) are intrinsically disordered stress proteins that are found in almost all land plants. They consist of a variable number of the short, semi-conserved, Y-, S-, and K-segments, with longer stretches of poorly conserved sequences in between. Previous studies have provided conflicting views on the details of the dehydrin cryoprotective mechanism of enzymes. Experiments with polyethylene glycol (PEG) have shown that PEG cryoprotective efficiency is the same as dehydrins of the same hydrodynamic radius, suggesting that the protein's disordered and polar nature is important, rather than the specific order of the residues. To further elucidate the mechanism, we created scrambled variants of the wild grape dehydrins K2 and YSK2 and tested their ability to protect lactate dehydrogenase and yeast frataxin homolog-1 from freeze/thaw damage. The results show that for preventing aggregation, it is the sequence composition and the size of the dehydrin that is the most important factor in protection, while for freeze/thaw damage causing loss of secondary structure, it is the sequence composition that is most significant.",On the development of equivalent medium for active implantable device radiofrequency safety assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102308,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 06 11,To develop the equivalent medium theorem that can be used to perform accurate evaluation of implantable device safety under MRI exposure.,IL-1RA suppresses esophageal cancer cell growth by blocking IL-1α.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102307,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,2019 05 18,Interleukin-1 promotes tumor angiogenesis through VEGF production.

Much recent evidence has shown that the extrinsic innervation of striatal interneurons is not indiscriminate but rather very specific, and that striatal interneurons are themselves interconnected in a cell type-specific manner. This suggests that the ultimate effect of extrinsic inputs on striatal neuronal activity depends critically on synaptic interactions within interneuronal circuitry. Here, we compared the cortical and thalamic input to two recently described subtypes of striatal GABAergic interneurons, tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing interneurons (THINS), and spontaneously active bursty interneurons (SABIs) using transgenic TH-Cre and Htr3a-Cre mice of both sexes. Our results show that both THINs and SABIs receive strong excitatory input from the motor cortex and the thalamic parafascicular nucleus. Cortical optogenetic stimulation also evokes disynaptic inhibitory GABAergic responses in THINs but not in SABIs. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation of the parafascicular nucleus induces disynaptic inhibitory responses in both interneuron populations. However, the short-term plasticity of these disynaptic inhibitory responses is different suggesting the involvement of different intrastriatal microcircuits. Altogether, our results point to highly specific interneuronal circuits that are selectively engaged by different excitatory inputs.",Repair of bileaflet prolapse in Barlow syndrome: The 4-chord technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102304,Journal of cardiac surgery,2019 05 18,"Barlow syndrome is a form of degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease found in a subset of patients with bileaflet prolapse. The hallmark of Barlow's disease includes excessive and billowing leaflet tissue caused by myxomatous tissue proliferation, elongated chordae, and pronounced annular dilatation.

Several techniques have been described to repair Barlow's MV including currently popular ""non-resectional"" approaches. Repair with neochordae has been associated with excellent results and includes the advantage of preserved leaflet mobility and a large surface of coaptation. We describe a simple approach to the use of neochordae to repair bileaflet prolapse in patients with Barlow syndrome and avoid systolic anterior motion."

Here, we found that the NF-κB signaling pathway is activated in adult sensory neurons through peripheral axotomy. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB in peripheral sensory neurons attenuated their axon growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results also showed that NF-κB modulated axon growth by repressing the phosphorylation of STAT3. Furthermore, activation of STAT3 significantly promoted adult optic nerve regeneration.

Residues of tiamulin in tissues of broiler chicken were also assessed. Plasma and tissue concentrations of tiamulin were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Plasma concentration-time data were described by the non-compartmental model for all three routes, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in pharmacokinetic parameters and mean plasma concentrations of tiamulin between three routes tested (crop, water, and feed), indicating equal efficacy. Tiamulin residues in edible tissues (muscles, skin, and fat) were lower than the advocated maximum residue limit (MRL of 0.1 µg/g and that of liver was 1 µg/g) on the 3rd day. No traces were found on the 5th day after drug administration. This indicated that the withdrawal period (less than 5 days) is very short, which makes it safer.

We generated active NF-κB mice and found that antral follicular numbers were higher than wild-type ovaries. Activation of NF-κB signaling could enhance granulosa cell proliferation and regress granulosa cell apoptosis of mouse ovarian follicles. Higher follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor expressions were observed in active NF-κB ovaries compared to wild type. Furthermore, we confirmed that NF-κB signaling was indeed involved in the granulosa cell viability and proliferation through FSHR using COV434 cell line. This is the first experimental evidence that NF-κB signaling is implicated in the control of follicular development through FSHR and its corresponding target molecules, which might be achieved by targeting proliferation and apoptosis in follicular granulosa cells.",Progranulin serum levels and gene expression in subcutaneous vs visceral adipose tissue of severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102282,Clinical endocrinology,2019 06 07,"Progranulin represents an adipokine putatively mediating insulin resistance and inflammation.

The MBF was administered intramuscularly (IM) at 2 mg kg-1  day-1 for 5 days. Plasma concentrations of MBF were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and PK parameters were obtained using noncompartmental analysis. The MBF concentrations peaked at 1 hr, and peak concentration (Cmax ) was 1.760 µg/ml on day 1 and 1.817 µg/ml on day 5. Repeated dosing of MBF caused no significant change in PK parameters except area under curve (AUC) between day 1 (AUC0-∞ D1 = 7.67 ± 0.719 µg × hr/ml) and day 5 (AUC0-∞ D5 = 8.70 ± 0.857 µg × hr/ml). A slight difference in mean residence time between 1st and 5th day of administration and accumulation index (AI = 1.13 ± 0.017) suggested lack of drug accumulation following repeated IM administration up to 5 days. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) demonstrated that Escherichia coli (MIC = 0.04 µg/ml) and Pasturella multocida (MIC = 0.05 µg/ml) were highly sensitive to MBF. Time-kill kinetics demonstrated rapid and concentration-dependent activity of MBF against these pathogens. PK/PD integration of data for E. coli and P. multocida, using efficacy indices: Cmax /MIC and AUC0-24hr /MIC, suggested that IM administration of MBF at a dose of 2 mg kg-1  day-1 is appropriate to treat infections caused by E. coli. However, a dose of 5 mg kg-1  day-1 is recommended to treat pneumonia caused by P. multocida in goats.

To overcome these limitations, after poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold establishment and incubation of uHSCs with fucosyltransferase-VI and GDP-fucose, ex vivo expansion of these cells on selectin-coated scaffold was done. The characteristics of the cultured fucosylated and nonfucosylated cells on a two-dimensional culture system, PLLA, and a selectin-coated scaffold were evaluated by flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, and CXCR4 expression at the messenger RNA and protein levels. According to the findings of this study, optimized attachment to the scaffold in scanning electron microscopy micrograph, maximum count of CFU, and the highest 570 nm absorption were observed in fucosylated cells expanded on selectin-coated scaffolds. Furthermore, real-time polymerase chain reaction showed the highest expression of the CXCR4 gene, and immunocytochemistry data confirmed that the CXCR4 protein was functional in this group compared with the other groups. Considered together, the results showed that selectin-coated scaffold could be a supportive structure for fucosylated uHSC expansion and homing by nanotopography. Fucosylated cells placed on the selectin-coated scaffold serve as a basal surface for cell-cell interaction and more homing potential of uHSCs. Accordingly, this procedure can also be considered as a promising technique for the hematological disorder treatment and tissue engineering applications.","The effect of subchronic oral exposure to zearalenone on hematologic and biochemical analytes, and the blood redox status of adult rabbit bucks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102279,Veterinary clinical pathology,2019 05 18,"Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycoestrogen with a ubiquitous presence in animal feeds, which also has hematotoxic, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, and immunotoxic properties.

Meanwhile, IGF1R expression was detected and the association between miR-7 and IGF1R was confirmed. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression was tested by immunohistochemical staining, and the lung metastasis was observed by H&E staining. miR-7 expression was decreased and methylation state of miR-7 was increased in OS tissues and cells. Upregulated miR-7 inhibited proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion,and migration, while inducing apoptosis of OS cells and the tumor growth as well as PCNA expression in nude mice. Expression of IGF1R was downregulated in OS cells with overexpression of miR-7. Experiments verified the binding site between miR-7 and IGF1R.

The present study advances empirical work on the topic by examining SAM-HPA co-activation during both the reactivity and recovery phases of the stress response following acute stress exposure. Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls (N = 149) provided cortisol and alpha-amylase via saliva at seven times throughout a 95-min assessment in which they were administered the modified Trier Social Stress Test. Parents reported on adolescents' life stress, pubertal development, medication use, and externalizing problems. Adolescents reported their own internalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regressions tested both direct and interactive effects of SAM and HPA reactivity and recovery on internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from these analyses showed that whereas SAM and HPA reactivity interacted to predict internalizing symptoms, it was their interaction during the recovery phase that predicted externalizing. Concurrent high SAM and HPA reactivity scores predicted high levels of internalizing and concurrently low SAM and HPA recovery scores predicted high levels of externalizing.

Growing evidence suggested that a new lncRNA, FAM83H-AS1, played important roles in several cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms of FAM83H-AS1-regulating functions in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) have yet to be explained. Thus study examined the role of lncRNA FAM83H-AS1 in progression of IDD. First, we proved that expression level of FAM83H-AS1 was expressed in nondegenerated nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues and degenerative NP samples. Moreover, we studied the expression level of FAM83H-AS1 relationship of the clinical disc degeneration grade. Our data suggested that FAM83H-AS1 expression was downregulated in normal NP samples compared with in the degenerated NP samples. FAM83H-AS1 expression was positively correlated with degree of disc degeneration grade. The expression of FAM83H-AS1 was positively correlated with scores of Pfirrmann grade. FAM83H-AS1 expression was increased by IL-1β and TNF-αtreatment in NP cells. Ectopic expression of FAM83H-AS1 induced cell growth and modulated extracellular matrix (ECM) expression in the NP cell. Elevated expression of FAM83H-AS1 promoted Notch1 and Hes1 expression in NP cells. Furthermore, FAM83H-AS1 induced NP cell growth and modulated ECM expression through targeting Notch 1. To conclude, dysregulated expression of FAM83H-AS1 played a crucial role in progression of IDD.",Silencing of long noncoding RNA RP11-476D10.1 enhances apoptosis and autophagy while inhibiting proliferation of papillary thyroid carcinoma cells via microRNA-138-5p-dependent inhibition of LRRK2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102261,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 05 18,"The distant metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a major threat for PTC patients. Moreover, the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of PTC progression has been extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to underscore whether lncRNA RP11-476D10.1 affects the proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy of PTC cells. Initially, we determined that lncRNA RP11-476D10.1 and LRRK2 were highly expressed in PTC cells. Meanwhile, through experimentation, miR-138-5p was confirmed to bind with lncRNA RP11-476D10.1 and LRRK2. It was also revealed that lncRNA RP11-476D10.1 downregulated the miR-138-5p expression, thereby upregulating the LRRK2 expression. After that, PTC cells were transfected with siRNA against RP11-476D10.1, or inhibitor or mimic of miR-138-5p to evaluate the influence of lncRNA RP11-476D10.1 on the PTC cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy in vitro and on the tumor formation ability in vivo. The results showed that silenced lncRNA RP11-476D10.1 or overexpressed miR-138-5p enhanced the apoptosis and autophagy of PTC cells while reducing cell proliferation, with increased levels of Bax, LC3B, and Beclin1 and decreased Bcl-2 level were observed.

To overcome this, we have developed a general computational strategy for de novo design of protein binding helical d-peptides. A d-helical fragment library was established and used in generating flexible d-helical conformations, which were then used to generate suitable sequences with the required structural and binding properties. Using this strategy, we successfully de novo designed d-helical peptides that bind to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), inhibit TNFα-TNFR1 binding, reduce TNFα activity in cellular assays, and are stable against protease digestion. Our strategy of helical d-peptide design is generally applicable for discovering d-peptide modulators against protein-protein interactions.","Secukinumab dosing optimization in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: Results from the randomised, open-label OPTIMISE study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102257,The British journal of dermatology,2019 05 18,Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises interleukin-17A.,Detection of cell-free circulating BRAFV600E by droplet digital PCR in melanoma and non-melanoma patients under dermatological surveillance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102256,The British journal of dermatology,2019 05 18,The p.V600E mutation in the BRAF gene (BRAFV600E ) is the most frequent mutation in cutaneous melanoma and is a recurrent alteration found in common benign naevi.

After synthesis by membrane-bound chitin synthases, it is extensively remodeled before incorporation into divergent matrices with wide-ranging physical and biological properties. This chapter discusses the properties of a variety of insect enzymes and proteins involved in this process. Chitin remodeling involves chitin synthases, which make the nascent chitin chains, and chitin deacetylases that partially deacetylate some of the N-acetylglucosamine residues either randomly or sequentially to yield local chitosan-like regions. Other proteins secreted into the procuticle or the midgut help in the assembly of single chitin chains into larger crystalline aggregates that measure in a few 100 nanometers. They are further embedded in a complex matrix of cuticular proteins or become associated with proteins containing chitin-binding domains to constitute the laminar procuticle or the lattice-like peritrophic matrix. During molting, previously formed laminar cuticle or PM are decrystallized/depolymerized to unmask the chitin chains, which then are degraded by a mixture of chitinolytic enzymes consisting of chitinases and N-acetylglucosaminidases present in molting fluid or in gut secretions. Some of the degradation products may be recycled for the synthesis of new matrices. We present a model of chitin synthesis, assembly, and degradation and the roles of these chitin-remodeling enzymes in this overall process.",Immune Responses of Mammals and Plants to Chitin-Containing Pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102242,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 18,"Chitin-containing organisms, such as fungi and arthropods, use chitin as a structural component to protect themselves from harsh environmental conditions. Hosts such as mammals and plants, however, sense chitin to initiate innate and adaptive immunity and exclude chitin-containing organisms. A number of protein factors are then expressed, and several signaling pathways are triggered. In this chapter, we focus on the responses and signal transduction pathways that are activated in mammals and plants upon invasion by chitin-containing organisms. As host chitinases play important roles in the glycolytic processing of chitin, which is then recognized by pattern-recognition receptors, we also pay special attention to the chitinases that are involved in immune recognition.","Chitin Prevalence and Function in Bacteria, Fungi and Protists.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102241,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 18,"Chitin is an important structural polysaccharide, which supports and organizes extracellular matrices in a variety of taxonomic groups including bacteria, fungi, protists, and animals.

In this paper, the thickening performance of a modified silicone on liquid CO2 is measured, and a rheology was investigated according to the consistency coefficient K and rheological index n. Meanwhile, a reservoir model was established to evaluate the fracturing property. Results showed that the modified silicone contributes to improve the apparent viscosity of liquid CO2 and decrease the rheology of liquid CO2. With the thickener content or pressure increase, the apparent viscosity of liquid CO2 increases, and the rheological index n decreased obviously. A reduced apparent viscosity is shown as the flow rate or temperature rises, but the rheology increased gradually. The fracturing simulation herein shows that thickened CO2 fracturing fluid could improve obviously the fracture property. This modified thickener possesses the potential as a thickener and could be a reliable alternative to the thickener in CO2 fracturing technology, and the large contact angle improved the backflow property of this CO2 thickener from rock surfaces.

However, phosphate rock reserves are depleting rapidly due to population growth. At the same time, several countries have imposed legislative regulations on P-release into surface waters due to eutrophication. Nutrient recovery from wastewater can facilitate a sustainable, cost-effective and environment-friendly source of phosphorus. Although P-recovery as struvite from wastewater has been widely studied for a long time, there still exists a lot of challenges for widespread full-scale implementation. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the technologies for phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite. Fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) are widely used compared to continuously stirred reactors for P-recovery as struvite because of different solid and liquid retention time. Commercially available technologies were reported to accomplish about 80% P-removal efficiencies with a reasonable P-recovery for the most of the cases. The struvite production rate of various technologies varies from 0.89 to 13.7 kg/kg influent P. Nevertheless, these technologies are associated with several shortcomings such as high operational costs, high energy consumption, and large footprint. Increasing efforts focusing on the development of sustainable and commercially feasible technologies are expected in this sector as P-recovery is considered to be the future of wastewater engineering.","Phytoplankton functional groups in a monomictic reservoir: seasonal succession, ecological preferences, and relationships with environmental variables.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102217,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 18,"The seasonal succession of phytoplankton functional groups (PFGs), their ecological preferences, relationships between environmental variables and PFGs, and ecological status were investigated in the Batman Dam Reservoir, a warm monomictic reservoir, located in the Tigris River basin of Turkey.

Centric diatoms Cyclotella ocellata (group B) and Aulacoseira granulata (group P) were dominant in the spring, with water mixing and low temperature. Groups F (Elakatothrix gelatinosa, Elakatothrix gelatinosa, and Sphaerocystis schroeteri), J (Pediastrum simplex and Coelastrum reticulatum), G (Eudorina elegans and Volvox aureus), LM (Ceratium and Microcystis), and H1 (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena spiroides) dominated the phytoplankton community from summer to mid-autumn, with thermal stratification.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) and concentration of primary pollutants (SOx, NOx, and PM2.5) were determined in rice and wheat crop season, for burning and non-burning periods. During crop residue burning periods, concentrations of SOx, NOx, and PM2.5 were exceeded the NAAQS values by 78%, 71%, and 53%, respectively. A significant increase in SOx (4.5 times), NOx (3.8 times), and PM2.5 concentration (3.5 times) was observed in stubble burning periods as compared to pre-burning (p < 0.05).

SEM analysis showed that TiO2 particles were successfully embedded and well distributed on the AC surface. The elemental composition analysis found that the TiO2/AC composite contained titanium (Ti), oxygen (O) and carbon (C) atoms. Meanwhile, the appearance of new band at about 960 cm-1 which assigned to the Ti-O stretching was observed in the FTIR spectra when the AC was incorporated into TiO2. TGA analysis showed that the weight loss of 32 wt.% from 150 to 550 °C was due to the decomposition of amorphous carbon layers and loss of hydroxyl groups on TiO2. It was found that the TiO2/AC composite had better performance in the sonocatalytic degradation of malachite green as compared to the individual AC and TiO2 because the TiO2/AC composite had dual functionality and huge number of active sites which could promote the mass transfer of dye molecules towards catalyst surface. By using 1.5 g/L of TiO2/AC composite which calcined at 700 °C on 100 mL of 200 mg/L of malachite green at solution pH of 7, a degradation efficiency of 87.11% had been achieved after 30 min of ultrasonic irradiation. A lower chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (81.75%) was observed because the structured dye molecules underwent mineralisation process during the sonocatalytic degradation to generate intermediate compounds. The TiO2/AC composite was able to be recycled and still achieved a high degradation efficiency of 76.78% after second catalytic cycle as compared to the fresh TiO2/AC composite with degradation efficiency of 87.11%. In conclusion, the TiO2/AC composite had high reusability and promising for practical applications in textile industry.",The expansion process of a Stellera chamaejasme population in a degraded alpine meadow of Northwest China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102213,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 18,"The expansion of poisonous plants can change vegetation community structures and affect grassland ecosystem service values. Stellera chamaejasme is one of the most important poisonous plants and has rapidly expanded in the arid areas of Northwest China in recent decades.

Therefore, we classified the S. chamaejasme population into five classes based on coverage: 31-40%, 41-50%, 51-60%, 61-70% and 71-80%. We investigated the spatial distribution patterns and the size compositions of S. chamaejasme under different coverages. The results show that the spatial distribution pattern of S. chamaejasme under low coverage (31-40%) at all study scales (0-100 cm) was random; the spatial distribution pattern translated to a clumped distribution from a random distribution at some scales, and the clumped distributions gradually became obvious, with coverage increasing from 41-50% to 61-70%; the spatial distribution tended to be random at all study scales when coverage was increased further (71-80%). However, the spatial distribution patterns were closely related to the size composition of the S. chamaejasme population. In particular, the quantity of older individuals had a significant impact on the variation of the spatial distribution patterns of S. chamaejasme. The spatial distribution pattern varied from a random distribution to a clumped distribution and then returned to a random distribution with increasing coverage (from 31-40% to 71-80%), and this may indicate that the S. chamaejasme patches experienced patch formation and extension and merged with each other."

However, diagnosing these cancers can be challenging, especially for kidney cancer, as many of the symptoms are non-specific and occur commonly in patients without cancer. Furthermore, the recognition and evaluation of these symptoms may differ because of the lack of supporting high-quality evidence to inform management, a problem also reflected in currently ambiguous guidelines. The majority of these two cancers are diagnosed following a referral from a general practitioner. In this article, we summarise current UK and United States (US) guidelines for investigating common symptoms of bladder and kidney cancer-visible haematuria, non-visible haematuria and urinary tract infections. Our article aims to support clinicians in recognising and investigating patients with symptoms of possible bladder and kidney cancer in a timely fashion. We discuss challenges during the diagnostic process and possible future interventions for improvement.",Frustrated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102200,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most useful cell resources for clinical application in regenerative medicine. However, standardization and quality assurance of MSCs are still essential problems because the stemness of MSCs depends on such factors as the collection method, individual differences associated with the source, and cell culture history. As such, the establishment of culture techniques which assure the stemness of MSCs is of vital importance. One important factor affecting MSCs during culture is the effect of the mechanobiological memory of cultured MSCs built up by their encounter with particular mechanical properties of the extracellular mechanical milieu. How can we guarantee that MSCs will remain in an undifferentiated state? Procedures capable of eliminating effects related to the history of the mechanical dose for cultured MSCs are required. For this problem, we have tried to establish the design of microelastically patterned cell-culture matrix which can effectively induce mechanical oscillations during the period of nomadic migration of cells among different regions of the matrix. We have previously observed before that the MSCs exposed to such a growth regimen during nomadic culture keep their undifferentiated state-with this maintenance of stemness believed due to lack of a particular regular mechanical dosage that is likely to determine a specific lineage. We have termed this situation as ""frustrated differentiation"". In this minireview, I introduce the concept of frustrated differentiation of MSCs and show possibility of purposeful regulation of this phenomenon.",Function-related conformational dynamics of G protein-coupled receptors revealed by NMR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102199,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) function as receptors for various neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and metabolites. GPCR ligands impart differing degrees of signaling in the G protein and arrestin pathways, in phenomena called biased signaling, and each ligand for a given GPCR has a characteristic level of ability to activate or deactivate its target, which is referred to as its efficacy. The ligand efficacies and biased signaling of GPCRs remarkably affect the therapeutic properties of the ligands. However, these features of GPCRs can only be partially understood from the crystallography data, although numerous GPCR structures have been solved. NMR analyses have revealed that GPCRs have multiple interconverting substates, exchanging on various timescales, and that the exchange rates are related to the ligand efficacies and biased signaling. In addition, NMR analyses of GPCRs in the lipid bilayer environment of rHDLs revealed that the exchange rates are modulated by the lipid bilayer environment, highlighting the importance of the function-related dynamics in the lipid bilayer. In this review, we will describe several solution NMR studies that have clarified the conformational dynamics related to the ligand efficacy and biased signaling of GPCRs.",Inorganic nanomaterials for chemo/photothermal therapy: a promising horizon on effective cancer treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102198,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"During the last few decades, nanotechnology has established many essential applications in the biomedical field and in particular for cancer therapy. Not only can nanodelivery systems address the shortcomings of conventional chemotherapy such as limited stability, non-specific biodistribution and targeting, poor water solubility, low therapeutic indices, and severe toxic side effects, but some of them can also provide simultaneous combination of therapies and diagnostics. Among the various therapies, the combination of chemo- and photothermal therapy (CT-PTT) has demonstrated synergistic therapeutic efficacies with minimal side effects in several preclinical studies. In this regard, inorganic nanostructures have been of special interest for CT-PTT, owing to their high thermal conversion efficiency, application in bio-imaging, versatility, and ease of synthesis and surface modification. In addition to being used as the first type of CT-PTT agents, they also include the most novel CT-PTT systems as the potentials of new inorganic nanomaterials are being more and more discovered. Considering the variety of inorganic nanostructures introduced for CT-PTT applications, enormous effort is needed to perform translational research on the most promising nanomaterials and to comprehensively evaluate the potentials of newly introduced ones in preclinical studies. This review provides an overview of most novel strategies used to employ inorganic nanostructures for cancer CT-PTT as well as cancer imaging and discusses current challenges and future perspectives in this area.",Differences in Cognition and Behaviour in Multiplex and Simplex Autism: Does Prior Experience Raising a Child with Autism Matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102196,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 18,"Previous research has found multiplex (MPX) children have an advantage in cognition compared to simplex (SPX) children. However, MPX parent's previous experience with older diagnosed siblings has not been considered. We used a large database sample to investigate the MPX advantage and contribution of birth order. Children from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) were stratified into first- (MPX1, n  = 152) and second-affected MPX (MPX2, n  = 143), SPX (n  = 111), and only-child SPX (SPXOC, n  = 23) groups. Both MPX groups had higher cognitive scores compared to SPX groups, with no differences between MPX1 and MPX2 groups. No differences were found for autism symptoms or adaptive behaviour. These results suggest parent experience due to birth order is an unlikely contributor to the MPX cognitive advantage.",Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder's Lying is Correlated with Their Working Memory But Not Theory of Mind.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102195,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 18,"The present study examined the role of executive function in lying for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The temptation resistance paradigm was used to elicit children's self-protective lies and the Hide-and-seek task was used to elicit children's self-benefiting lies. Results showed that children with ASD told fewer lies in the two deception tasks compared to children with intellectual disability (ID) and typically developing (TD) children. Furthermore, children with ASD's lying were positively correlated with their working memory, but not with their theory of mind. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying deception for children with ASD are distinct from that of TD children.",Vestibular Function in Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102194,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 18,"This review was performed to investigate the characteristics of vestibular dysfunctions in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The majority of the included studies reported central and/or peripheral vestibular aberrations in a subset of these children. These alterations may result in symptoms of distorted motor coordination or postural instability, and might explain some of the balance problems observed in this population. However, high-quality studies with an extensive vestibular test battery are required to further characterize the vestibular function in NDDs since current findings are ambiguous and mainly based on evaluation of the horizontal semicircular canals alone. Importantly, since vestibular dysfunctions may result in comparable characteristics as found in NDDs, clinicians should be aware of these similarities when establishing the NDD diagnosis.",Efficacy of Group-Based Organised Physical Activity Participation for Social Outcomes in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102193,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 18,"The aim of this novel review and meta-analysis was to clarify the effects of group-based organised physical activity (OPA) for social and communicative outcomes in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

More specifically, we studied the predictive power of such models at early vs. late stages of word recognition by using eye-tracking during two tasks. The tasks included a standard lexical decision task and a word recognition task that assumedly places less emphasis on postlexical reanalysis and decision processes. The lexical decision results showed good performance of Morfessor models based on the Minimum Description Length optimization principle. Models which segment words at some morpheme boundaries and keep other boundaries unsegmented performed well both at early and late stages of word recognition, supporting dual- or multiple-route cognitive models of morphological processing. Statistical models based on full forms fared better in late than early measures. The results of the second, multi-word recognition task showed that early and late stages of processing often involve accessing morphological constituents, with the exception of short complex words. Late stages of word recognition additionally involve predicting upcoming morphemes on the basis of previous ones in multimorphemic words. The statistical models based fully on whole words did not fare well in this task. Thus, we assume that the good performance of such models in global measures such as gaze durations or reaction times in lexical decision largely stems from postlexical reanalysis or decision processes. This finding highlights the importance of considering task demands in the study of morphological processing."

Life sciences,2019 05 18,"Several potential oxidative agents have damaging effects on mammalian reproductive systems. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) supplementation on antioxidant enzymes and immune defense systems in the outer scrotum of boars injected with H2O2. A total of 24 healthy boars were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups: control (basal diet, saline-treated), H2O2 (basal diet, H2O2-challenged outer scrotum (1 mL kg-1 BW)), Glu (basal diet +2% Glu, H2O2-challenged), and Asp (basal diet+2% Asp, H2O2-challenged). Our results showed that both Glu and Asp supplementation improved testicular morphology and decreased the genital index in the H2O2-treated boars. Glu and Asp administration increased the antioxidant enzyme activities and affected the testicular inflammatory cytokine secretion but had no effect on sex hormone levels. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of CAT, CuZnSOD, and GPx4 was altered in the testes and epididymis of boars treated with Asp and Glu. Glu and Asp supplementation also modulated the expression of TGF-β1, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in the testis and epididymis. These results indicate that dietary Glu and Asp supplementation might enhance antioxidant capacity and regulate the secretion and expression of inflammatory cytokines to protect the testes and epididymis of boars against oxidative stress.",Preliminary study of the urinary proteome in Li and Han ethnic individuals from Hainan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102176,Science China. Life sciences,2019 05 18,"Biomarkers indicate changes associated with disease. Blood is relatively stable due to the homeostatic mechanisms of the body; however, urine accumulates metabolites from changes in the body, making it a better source for early biomarker discovery. The Li ethnic group is a unique minority ethnic group that has only lived on Hainan Island for approximately 5,000 years. Studies have shown that various specific genetic variations are different between the Li and Han ethnic groups. However, whether the urinary proteome between these two ethnic groups is significantly different remains unknown. In this study, differential urinary proteins were identified in the Li and Han ethnic groups using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In total, 1,555 urinary proteins were identified. Twenty-five of the urinary proteins were statistically significantly different, 16 of which have been previously reported to be biomarkers of many diseases, and that these significantly different proteins were caused by ethnic differences rather than random differences. Ethnic group differences may be an influencing factor in urine proteome studies and should be considered when human urine samples are used for biomarker discovery.",The Ethics of the Societal Entrenchment-approach and the case of live uterus transplantation-IVF.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102175,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy",2019 05 18,"In 2014, the first child in the world was born after live uterus transplantation and IVF (UTx-IVF). Before and after this event, ethical aspects of UTx-IVF have been discussed in the medical and bioethical debate as well as, with varying intensity, in Swedish media and political fora. This article examines what comes to be identified as important ethical problems and solutions in the media debate of UTx-IVF in Sweden, showing specifically how problems, target groups, goals, benefits, risks and stakes are delineated and positioned. It also demonstrates how specific assumptions, norms and values are expressed and used to underpin specific positions within this debate, and how certain subjects, desires and risks become shrouded or simply omitted from it. This approach-which we label the Ethics of the Societal Entrenchment-approach, inspired by Koch and Stemerding (1994)-allows us to discuss how the identification of something as the problem helps to shape what gets to be described as a solution, and how specific solutions provide frameworks within which problems can be stated and emphasised.

In experiment 1, two masked Chinese words of the same or different categories (""orange apple"" or ""grape hammer"") were simultaneously presented in the prime, followed by two Chinese words also of same or different categories in the target. We examined possible prime/target visual feature priming, semantic category priming and motor response priming effects. Moreover, two ISI intervals (53, 163 ms) between the prime and the target words were used to examine the positive and negative priming. The results revealed a negative motor response priming and a positive semantic category priming effect independent of the ISI when the target words were of the same category. Experiment 2 eliminated an alternative interpretation of the effect based on different number of category words changed across the prime and the target. Experiment 3 eliminated a potential confound of unequal numbers of trials for motor congruent and incongruent conditions in Experiment 1. Overall, these results indicated an integration between the meanings of the two subliminally perceived words in the prime. The difference between simultaneous and sequential presentations, and the reason why positive priming was not observed when the interval between the prime and the target was short were discussed in the context of unconscious semantic integration.",Effects of Ketoconazole on ACTH-Producing and Non-ACTH-Producing Neuroendocrine Tumor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102172,Hormones & cancer,2019 06 10,"Prolonged remission of hypercortisolism with steroidogenesis inhibitors has been described in patients with ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome. The anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of ketoconazole in human cancer cells was previously suggested. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of ketoconazole on ACTH-producing and non-ACTH-producing neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cell lines. The effects of ketoconazole alone, and in combination with somatostatin analogs, were evaluated in two human cell lines: DMS-79 (ectopic ACTH-producing small cell lung carcinoma) and BON-1 (human pancreatic NET). Total DNA measurement, apoptosis, cell cycle, chromogranin A (CgA)/proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression by qRT-PCR, serotonin, CgA, and ACTH secretion assays were performed. In both cell lines, ketoconazole significantly suppressed cell growth and colony formation in a dose and time-dependent manner. The effect in DMS-79 was primarily cytotoxic, while it was more apoptotic in BON-1 cells. Ketoconazole also induced increase in G0/G1 phase in both cell lines and arrest in phase G2/M of BON-1 cells. Ketoconazole did not affect the secretion of serotonin, CgA, ACTH, or the mRNA expression of CgA and POMC. Decreased serotonin secretion was observed after the combination treatment with pasireotide. These results suggest a direct effect of ketoconazole on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle in both ACTH- and non-ACTH-producing NET cells.",MicroRNA Expression and Correlation with mRNA Levels of Colorectal Cancer-Related Genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102171,Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,2019 05 18,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as a family of non-coding RNAs, have opened a new window in cancer biology and transcriptome.

However, the neural mechanisms of working memory dysfunction in MCI have not been clearly understood. In this study, we used proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-fMRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand the underlying neurobiology of working memory deficits in patients with MCI. We aimed at detecting the changes in the concentration of glutamate and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity using 1H-fMRS and fMRI respectively during a low load verbal (0 back and 1 back) working memory in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) between patients with MCI and healthy controls. Fifteen patients with amnestic MCI and twenty two age, gender and education matched healthy controls underwent a low load verbal working memory 1H-fMRS and fMRI. We observed significant increase in glutamate during working memory task (both 0 back and 1 back) in healthy controls and such changes were absent in patients with MCI. However, percent signal changes representing BOLD activity during both 0 back and 1 back was not significantly different between two groups. Our findings suggest that 1H-fMRS complements fMRI in understanding the working memory mechanism in the left DLPFC.","Resting-state functional connectivity, cognition, and fatigue in response to cognitive exertion: a novel study in adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102168,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 18,"Emerging evidence suggests that central nervous system dysfunction may underlie the core symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in adults, such as cognitive disturbance, fatigue and post-exertional malaise. Research into brain dysfunction in the pediatric CFS/ME context, however, is severely lacking. It is unclear whether the adolescent CFS/ME brain functions differently compared with healthy peers, particularly in situations where significant mental effort is required. This study used resting-state functional MRI in a novel repeated-measures design to evaluate intrinsic connectivity, cognitive function, and subjective fatigue, before and after a period of cognitive exertion in 48 adolescents (25 CFS/ME, 23 healthy controls). Results revealed little evidence for a differential effect of cognitive exertion in CFS/ME compared with controls. Both groups demonstrated a similar rate of reduced intrinsic functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), reduced sustained attentional performance, slower processing speed, and increased subjective fatigue as a result of cognitive exertion. However, CFS/ME adolescents consistently displayed higher subjective fatigue, and controls outperformed the CFS/ME group overall on cognitive measures of processing speed, sustained attention and new learning. No brain-behavior relationships were observed between DMN connectivity, cognitive function, and fatigue over time. These findings suggest that effortful cognitive tasks may elicit similar levels of energy expenditure across all individuals in the form of reduced brain functioning and associated fatigue. However, CFS/ME may confer a lower starting threshold from which to access energy reserves and cognitive resources when cognitive effort is required.",Gender differences in cortical morphological networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102167,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 18,"Cortical morphological networks (CMN), where each network models the relationship in morphology between different cortical brain regions quantified using a specific measurement (e.g., cortical thickness), have not been investigated with respect to gender differences in the human brain.

Hence, by leveraging machine learning techniques with the potential to highlight multivariate interacting effects, we found that the most discriminative CMN connections between males and females were derived from the left hemisphere using the mean sulcal depth as measurement. However, for both left and right hemispheres, the first most discriminative morphological connection revealed across all cortical attributes involved (entorhinal cortex ↔ caudal anterior cingulate cortex) and (entorhinal cortex ↔ transverse temporal cortex) respectively, which gives us new insights into behavioral gender differences from an omics perspective and might explain why males and females learn differently.",Autobiographical memory in epileptic patients after temporal lobe resection or bitemporal hippocampal sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102166,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 18,"The human hippocampus is believed to be a crucial node in the neural network supporting autobiographical memory retrieval. Structural mesial temporal damage associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) provides an opportunity to systematically investigate and better understand the local and distal functional consequences of mesial temporal damage in the engagement of the autobiographical memory network. We examined 19 TLE patients (49.21 ± 11.55 years; 12 females) with unilateral mesial TLE (MTLE; 12 with anterior temporal lobe resection: 6 right MTLE, 6 left MTLE) or bilateral mesial TLE (7 BMTLE) and 18 matched healthy subjects. We used functional MRI (fMRI) with an adapted autobiographical memory paradigm and a specific neuropsychological test (Autobiographical Memory Interview, AMI). While engaged in the fMRI autobiographical memory paradigm, all groups activated a large fronto-temporo-parietal network. However, while this network was left lateralized for healthy participants and right MTLE patients, left MTLE and patients with BMTLE also showed strong activation in right temporal and frontal regions. Moreover, BMTLE and left MTLE patients also showed significant mild deficits in episodic autobiographical memory performance measured with the AMI test. The right temporal and extra-temporal fMRI activation, along with the impairment in autobiographical memory retrieval found in left MTLE and BMTLE patients suggest that alternate brain areas-other than the hippocampus-may also support this process, possibly due to neuroplastic effects."

Further, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis identified pathways associated with diseases, organismal systems, and antigen processing and presentation. Additionally, the pathways known to involve Hspa1a and Hspa1b were also activated in the S19T group. On the other hand, after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, cell viability and IgM production were significantly decreased in Sirt1 KO B cells, while expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were increased. In summary, our study reveals that Sirt1 may maintain the quiescent state in resting B cells by suppressing the increase of Hspa1a and Hspa1b. This work provides a foundation for further studies on the functional roles of Sirt1 in B cells.",Genotyping and phenotyping CYP3A4\CYP3A5: no association with antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102151,Molecular biology reports,2019 05 18,"The objective of this study was to determine the impact of polymorphism of CYP3A subfamily isoenzymes (allelic variants of CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3) on the efficacy clopidogrel in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Platelet activity was determined on a VerifyNow P2Y12 test system in 81 patients with ACS aged 37-91 who had PCI. The activity of CYP3A4/5 was expressed as the ratio of the concentrations of cortisol and 6β-hydroxycortisol was performed by using high performance liquid chromatography. Genotyping was performed by using real-time polymerase real-time chain reaction. The frequencies for the CYP3A5 gene, rs 776746, were identified as follows: 77 (95.1%)-CC, 4 (4.9%)-CT; the allele frequencies by loci for the CYP3A4, rs rs35599367, were as follows: 78 (96.3%)-GG, 3 (3.7%)-AG. There was no statistically significant genotype-dependent difference between the presence of a minor T and G alleles and the presence of clopidogrel resistance (OR 3.53; 95% CI 0.46-26.94; p = 0.233 and p = 0.443, respectively). The average level of the metabolic relationship (6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol) between the clopidogrel-resistant group and the normal platelet reactivity group was not statistically significantly different: 3.3 ± 2.8 versus 3.2 ± 3.2; p = 0.947. So, the activity of CYP3A4/5 was not related to platelet aggregation rates in this model. Genotyping and phenotyping CYP3A4\CYP3A5 does not predict the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. More extensive research is required to establish their clinical relevance.",Vector-free in vivo trans-determination of adult hepatic stem cells to insulin-producing cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102150,Molecular biology reports,2019 05 18,"A reduction in the number of functional β-cells is the central pathological event in diabetes. Liver and ventral pancreas differentiates simultaneously in the same general domain of cells within embryonic endoderm. In addition, the precursor cell population being bi-potential may be targeted for either pancreas or liver development. Hepatic stem cells were redirected in vivo to functional insulin producing cells in a acetylaminofluorene-partial hepatectomy (AAF/PH) adult male rat model with/without GLP-1 treatment. In routine H&E histology and immunohistochemistry, stem cells resembled β cells in GLP-1 injected rats. Immunoblots revealed involvement of adenylate cyclase, TLR4 and PDX1 in insulin synthesis. Expression of genes (GLP-1R, MAFA, PDX1, INS1 and INS2) augmented in the GLP-1 treated regenerated liver. Results strongly indicated the key role of GLP-1 in the induction of insulin secretion in trans-determined reprogrammed cell in vivo. The present method being vector free poses no risk of vector spillover in the host and holds promise.","Anti-angiogenic activity of Gracilaria coronopifolia J.G. Agardh extract by lowering the levels of trace metals (iron, zinc and copper) in duck chorioallantoic membrane and in vitro activation of AMP-kinase.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102149,Molecular biology reports,2019 05 18,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an intracellular energy sensor important in metabolic regulation, cell growth, and survival. However, the specific role of AMPK signaling pathway in the inhibition of angiogenesis remains unclear. The study highlights the activity on AMP activated protein kinase signaling pathways of a marine algae, Gracilaria coronopifolia, and its effects on angiogenesis. It was found that the most potent extract, GCD, inhibited angiogenesis significantly in the duck chorioallantoic membrane assay and also activated the enzyme AMP-kinase, in vitro. The dichloromethane extract was found most active in inhibiting angiogenesis in the duck chorioallantoic membrane (IC50 = 1.21 μg/mL) followed by GCH (IC50 = 3.08 μg/mL) (p = 0.479) and GCM (IC50 = 8.93 μg/mL) (p = 0.042). Benferroni post hoc analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the percent inhibitions of GCH and GCM extracts (p = 0.479). Consequently, angiogenic inhibition caused lowering of iron, zinc, and copper levels in the duck CAM. Thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the components of each extracts. Notably, this is the first report on the kinase activity of a red algae G. coronopifolia extracts and a colorimetric-based quantification of angiogenesis based on metal content of CAM. Our data also suggest a novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting angiogenesis through the AMPK pathway.",Conus striatus venom exhibits non-hepatotoxic and non-nephrotoxic potent analgesic activity in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102148,Molecular biology reports,2019 05 18,"Constant research into the pharmaceutical properties of marine natural products has led to the discovery of many potentially active agents considered worthy of medical applications. Genus Conus, which approximately comprises 700 species, is currently under every researcher's interest because of the conopeptides in their crude venom. Conopeptides have a wide range of pharmacological classes and properties. This research focused on the crude venom of Conus striatus to assess its analgesic activity, mutagenicity, nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity in mice. The crude venom was extracted from the conus snails and the protein concentration was determined using Bradford's method. The analgesic activity of the venom was determined using the hot-plate method and standard IFCC method was used to determine the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Evaluation of mutagenicity was done using micronucleus assay and the nephrotoxicity of the venom was determined using Kidney Coefficient and serum creatinine concentration. The maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of the crude venom was found to be 75 ppm. The venom exhibited potent analgesic activity even higher than the positive control (Ibuprofen). Most of the analgesic drugs can usually impact damage in the liver and kidneys. However, AST and ALT results revealed that the venom has no adverse effects on the liver. Although the venom increased the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes, making it mutagenic, with MTD concentration's mutagenicity comparable to the positive control methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The kidney coefficients, on the other hand, showed no significant difference between the treated groups and that of the untreated group. The serum creatinine also showed a concentration-dependent increase; with MTD treated mice got the highest creatinine concentration. However, MTD/2 and MTD/4 showed no significant difference in creatinine levels with respect to the untreated groups. Hence, the nephrotoxicity of the venom was only evident when used at higher concentration. The venom exhibited potent analgesic activity indicated that the C. striatus crude venom extract could have a potential therapeutic component as analgesic drugs that displayed no hepatic damage. This study also suggests that for this venom to be utilized for future medical applications, their usage must be regulated and properly monitored to avoid nephrotoxic effect.",Use of Initial Noninvasive Cardiac Testing and Association with Downstream Healthcare Resource: A Retrospective Review of Resources Used Across a 12-Month Window for Probable Type I Myocardial Infarction Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102147,PharmacoEconomics - open,2019 05 18,"Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with substantial discretion in the use of noninvasive cardiac testing for patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Repeat testing, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, and increases in other cardiac-related procedures can be a burden on patients and payers and can complicate treatment planning.

In Latin America (LatAm, composed of the many nations of Central America, South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean), access to healthcare, pain management, and opioid analgesics can vary. Despite an international U.S.-led trend toward greater control in opioid prescribing, the role of opioids in the management of severe pain in LatAm is probably smaller than it should be, as opioid consumption in LatAm overall is low. Buprenorphine is a strong opioidwith certain characteristics that make it a potentially useful analgesic agent in LatAm: it has a unique pharmacology that allows for transdermal administration and a favorable safety profile with a ceiling effect for respiratory depression. It has a well-studied low risk potential for misuse, and there is strong evidence for its safety and efficacy in managing both cancer and noncancer pain in adults. Caregivers and policy makers in LatAm may learn from the U.S. experience with opioids in order to develop protocols to better and safely manage pain, and it is possible that buprenorphine will play a key role.",Stromal organization as predictive biomarker for the treatment of colon cancer with adjuvant bevacizumab; a post-hoc analysis of the AVANT trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102145,Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),2019 05 18,"Intra-tumoral stroma has become increasingly important in understanding tumor biology, tumor progression and clinical outcome.

This study estimated the I. ricinus tick density, prevalence of infection with Borrelia species and the diversity of these bacteria in a green urban area (Olsztyn) of north-eastern Poland, an endemic region of tick-borne diseases. The ticks were collected during spring and autumn of 2015, at sites differing in the degree of human pressure and habitat. Borrelia species detection, typing and a molecular phylogenetic analysis were carried out based on the sequenced flaB gene. The overall mean abundance of I. ricinus was 2.0 ± 1.55 ticks per 100 m2. The density of I. ricinus did not vary significantly between sites. According to semi-qualitative tick abundance categories, the collection sites were classified as 'very low' and 'low' tick abundance category. The overall infection rate of I. ricinus with Borrelia spirochaetes was 27.4%. The infection rate of adult ticks (42.0%) was three times higher than with nymphs (14.3%).

This review examines the evidence for use of the GFD in patients without celiac disease who self-report intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms (non-celiac gluten sensitivity), as well as for enhancement of athletic performance and treatment of autism, rheumatoid arthritis, and psychiatric disorders. Overall, the evidence for use of GFDs in conditions other than celiac disease is poor. Though non-celiac gluten sensitivity may ultimately emerge as a biomarker-defined condition, a large proportion of patients with apparent non-celiac gluten sensitivity have, after careful investigation, an alternative diagnosis. In light of this, and coupled with the potential physical and psychological harms associated with the avoidance of gluten, initiating a GFD should not be encouraged for people who have these other conditions or are seeking physical/athletic enhancement.",Hypoxic Macrophage-Derived VEGF Promotes Proliferation and Invasion of Gastric Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102128,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019 05 18,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death.

When it is hydrolyzed by a protease, subtilisin A from Bacillus licheniformis, it possesses Cu2+-chelating activity. In the present work, we demonstrate that the resulting OVM hydrolysates bind to reverse-phase chromatography media in pipette tips and can be applied to remove Cu2+ within microdroplets. 1.4 nmol of purified OVM was digested in the presence of 17 pmol of subtilisin A at 55 °C for 3 h. The OVM hydrolysates efficiently removed 2.1 and 2.4 nmol of Cu2+ in the droplets by binding to the C4 and C18 chromatography media, respectively. Conversely, 0.6 and 1.0 nmol of Cu2+ were removed by the non-digested OVM bound to the C4 and C18 media, respectively. The removal ratio of Cu2+ increased as more OVM was digested by subtilisin A. The digested OVM polypeptides were stained with Cu2+ after they were separated by non-denaturing electrophoresis. These results indicate that OVM hydrolysates bound to chromatography media in a pipette tip can be applied to remove Cu2+ within microdroplets of biological samples.",Co-Nanoencapsulation of Vitamin D3 and Curcumin Regulates Inflammation and Purine Metabolism in a Model of Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102126,Inflammation,2019 05 18,"We analyzed the effects of a nanoencapsulated association of curcumin and vitamin D3 on purine metabolism enzymes in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets in a model of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. Following AIA induction, the animals were treated for 15 days with free and nanoencapsulated curcumin (4 mg/kg), nanocapsules of vitamin D3 (VD3) (15.84 IU/day), a nanoencapsulated combination of curcumin and VD3, vehicle, or blank nanocapsules. The animals were euthanized, and blood was collected to evaluate the activities of E-NTPDase, adenosine deaminase (ADA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO), as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and biochemical parameters. Also, the liver and kidney were collected for histological analysis. The changes in the activities of purinergic enzymes indicated that inflammation was significantly reverted by vitamin D3 and curcumin co-nanoencapsulation treatments in the arthritic rats. The reduction of inflammation was confirmed by the reduction in the signs and symptoms of AIA, as well as in MPO activity by all formulations. The treatments with nanocapsules reverted histological alterations in the kidney. Serum parameters were not altered by the induction or treatments. Our results suggest that co-nanoencapsulation of vitamin D3 and curcumin is an efficient alternative adjuvant treatment for rheumatoid arthritis as it reverts the changes in the purine metabolism and reduces arthritis-associated inflammation.",Cellular Inflammatory Response of the Spleen After Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102125,Inflammation,2019 05 18,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) involves both primary and secondary damages. After the phase of primary injury, a series of inflammatory responses initiate, which belong to the secondary injury. There has been little investigation into the cellular inflammatory response of the spleen to SCI. To disclose the impact of SCI on the spleen, we examined the inflammatory reactions of the spleen during the acute phase of SCI in rat. Adult rats were used as experimental animals and divided into un-injured, sham, and SCI groups (n = 36). Contusion injuries were produced at the T3 vertebral level. Spinal cords were harvested 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 120 h, and 168 h after surgery and were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Spleen wet weight was measured. Blood and spleens were prepared for quantitative analyses. The spleen index was significantly decreased in the SCI groups. Immunohistochemical results showed an increase of the infiltrating cells in the spinal cord tissues from SCI rats at all time points, peaking in 72 h post injury. In the blood, T and B lymphocytes significantly decreased in the SCI group as compared with the sham group, while monocyte increased. Surprisingly, in the SCI group, neutrophil initially decreased and subsequently tended to return toward baseline levels, then remained elevated until the end of the study. Spleen analyses revealed a significant increase in monocyte and neutrophil but a minor (not statistically significant) reduction in T and B lymphocytes. Our data show that the four most prevalent inflammatory cells infiltrate the spinal cord after injury. Increased levels of inflammatory cells (monocyte and neutrophil) in the blood and spleen appear to be very sensitive to SCI. The spleen plays a critical role in the acute phase of SCI.",Autotaxin-Lysophosphatidic Acid Axis Blockade Improves Inflammation by Regulating Th17 Cell Differentiation in DSS-Induced Chronic Colitis Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102124,Inflammation,2019 05 18,"Autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid (ATX-LPA) axis is closely associated with several inflammation-related diseases. In the colonic mucosa of patients with chronic ulcerative colitis (UC), the expression of ATX and the percentage of Th17 cells are found to increase. However, it is unclear whether ATX-LPA axis affects the differentiation of Th17 cells in chronic UC. To investigate whether ATX-LPA axis contributes to Th17 cell differentiation, a mouse model of chronic UC was established by drinking water with DSS at intervals. ATX inhibitor was used as an intervention. The disease active index (DAI), colonic weight to length ratio, colon length, colon histopathology, and MAdCAM-1 were observed. Additionally, the expression of ATX, LPA receptor, CD34, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-6, ROR-γt, STAT3 in colonic tissue, and the percentage of Th17 cells in spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were measured using different methods. ATX blockade was able to relieve symptoms and inflammatory response of DSS-induced chronic colitis. The DAI and colonic weight to length ratio were apparently decreased, while the colon length was increased. The pathological damage and colitis severity were lighter in the inhibitor group than that in the DSS group. Inhibiting ATX reduced the expression of ATX, LPA receptor, and CD34 and also decreased the percentages of Th17 cells in spleens and MLNs and the expressions of IL-17A and IL-21, as well as the factors in Th17 cell signaling pathway including IL-6, ROR-γt, and STAT3 in colonic tissue. ATX-LPA axis blockade could alleviate inflammation by suppressing Th17 cell differentiation in chronic UC.",Puerarin Protects Against LPS-Induced Vascular Endothelial Cell Hyperpermeability via Preventing Downregulation of Endothelial Cadherin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102123,Inflammation,2019 05 18,"In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of puerarin on the hyperpermeability of vascular endothelial cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its underlying mechanisms. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-incubated with puerarin (25, 50, and 100 μM) for 1 h, and then exposed to LPS (1 μg/mL). The monolayer permeability of endothelial cells was assessed by measuring the paracellular flux of FITC-dextran 40,000 (FD40). The expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) in HUVECs was examined by Western blotting analysis. A total of 18 mice were randomly assigned into three groups as follows: control group, LPS group, and puerarin group. The pulmonary W/D ratio (wet-to-dry weight ratios) was calculated, and the lung morphology was examined. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in cell supernatant and mouse serum were determined by ELISA. Compared with the control group, LPS obviously increased the flux of FD40 and the monolayer permeability, raised the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in cell supernatant, and reduced the VE-cadherin expression in HUVECs. However, puerarin (25, 50, and 100 μM) was able to relieve such LPS-induced increase in flux of FD40 and then reduce the hyperpermeability. Puerarin decreased the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in cell supernatant and increased the VE-cadherin expression in HUVECs (P < 0.05). Moreover, LPS obviously increased the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in mouse serum and elevated the pulmonary W/D ratios, resulting in lung injury. However, all of above-mentioned LPS-induced changes were improved by puerarin pre-treatment. Puerarin could alleviate LPS-induced hyperpermeability in endothelial cells via preventing downregulation of endothelial cadherin."

In this study, we demonstrate that AuNPs synthesized by a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally compatible method can be easily conjugated with the antibodies anti-COX-2, anti-MIF, and Alexa Fluor® 488 (ALEXA) to perform immunofluorescence staining in inflamed tissues. Moreover, we showed that primary antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be used to target M2 macrophages by flow cytometry. We designed three immunofluorescence staining protocols of tissue section with AuNPs for 30 min and overnight incubation, as well as one flow cytometry protocol of M2 macrophage labeling with AuNPs for 30 min. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry results suggest that conjugation was achieved by direct adsorption of antibodies on the AuNPs surface. When compared to the standard ALEXA protocol in immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry (FC), our 30-min incubation protocol using AuNPs instead of ALEXA decreased from approximately 23 h to 5 h for IF and from 4 h to 1 h for FC, proving to be less laborious, which makes the method eligible for inflammation-induced cancer diagnostic.",The Effects of Sleep Loss on Military Physical Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102110,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 05 18,"As part of both training and active service, military members can be exposed to prolonged periods of sleep loss. Given the extent of physical and cognitive performances viewed as critical to successful military performance, such sleep disruption may present risk to health and performance. The primary aim of this narrative review was to investigate evidence on the effect of inadequate sleep on measures of aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, muscular strength and muscular endurance in military personnel. Sleep loss appears to have the greatest negative impact on aerobic capacity, muscular endurance and military-specific performance in military populations. The findings showed varied results for handgrip strength and anaerobic capacity, with sleep loss inducing a decrease in mean power of the upper body. In comparison to other measures of performance, lower-body muscular strength appeared to be resilient to sleep restriction. However, due to the limited evidence and inter-individual variability in results there is no clear consensus on the specific volume of sleep loss that induces significant or meaningful performance decrements. The difficulties of conducting well-designed and -controlled interventions in military populations are appreciated. However, due to the low quality of reporting and lack of control for confounders (i.e. physical activity, load carriage, prior sleep debt, motivation and energy intake) in the majority of studies, it is difficult to establish the relationship between sleep loss and physical performance in military populations.",Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Pharmacist-Led Transitions of Care Services on the 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Rate of Patients with Congestive Heart Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102109,Clinical drug investigation,2019 05 18,A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the cumulative effect of pharmacist-led transitions of care on the 30-day all-cause readmission rates of patients with congestive heart failure with the objective to isolate and assess the effect of pharmacy intervention to a condition-specific service.

Among the 5220 individuals who completed the survey, 55.6% were men and the median age was 24 years [IQR: 20-31]. Among the participants, 2751 (52.7%) reported PSU at least once in their life. Ascending hierarchical clustering identified seven distinct profiles of participants based on their PSU. This study shows a high prevalence of PSU and alcohol consumption in this young population. Moreover, subgroup analysis allowed identifying groups of psychoactive substance users who presented specific risks or vulnerabilities and who should be priority targets for interventions, particularly sexual minority groups.","Sex, race, and the role of relationships in diabetes health: intersectionality matters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102104,Journal of behavioral medicine,2019 05 18,"Previous research has seldom used an intersectionality framework to consider how sex and race affect diabetes health, nor has it examined the role of sex and race in the well-established link between romantic relationship quality and health. This study targeted 200 adults with type 2 diabetes (46% Black; 45% female) and examined whether sex, race, and the interaction between sex and race predicted behavioral and psychological health, or moderated the link between relationship quality and health outcomes. Black women reported poorer diabetes self-care and lower self-efficacy compared to other groups. Relationship quality was associated with better self-care, increased self-efficacy, and lower depressive symptoms. The association between relationship quality and medication adherence was stronger for Black women, and the association between relationship quality and self-efficacy was stronger for both Black women and White men. Results suggest that Black women with diabetes experience more health disadvantages than other groups, but some of these disadvantages might be attenuated by supportive romantic relationships.",Degradation of azo dyes by Alcaligenes aquatilis 3c and its potential use in the wastewater treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102103,AMB Express,2019 06 10,"In the present study, Alcaligenes aquatilis was found to decolorize 82% Synazol red 6HBN after incubation of 4 days at 37 °C and pH 7. Maximum decolorization was found under static conditions by using saw dust and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen source. It also showed promising potential to decolorize mixture of multiple dyes at a rate of more than 86% in 5 days. Decolorization of dye had positive influence on the growth of bacterium as growth rate was increased along with decolorization. The cleavage of azo bond was confirmed through TLC, HPLC and GC-MS analysis. The dye metabolites produced during bacterial treatment are linked to various pathways including ATP synthesis process. The absence of peaks of wavelength 1612/cm and 1532/cm in bacterially treated FTIR sample demonstrated the cleavage of azo bond. Microbial growth in decolorized dye wastewater shows that bacterially decolorized wastewater is unharmful for the growth of micro-flora. The high decolorization ability of A. aquatilis 3c to convert toxic azo dyes into useful end products may find potential applications in the environmental biotechnology.","Differences in Breast Cancer Stage at Diagnosis by Ethnicity, Insurance Status, and Family Income in Young Women in the USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102102,Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2019 05 18,"Describe the clinical and epidemiological data from young women with breast cancer and determine the association between ethnicity, insurance status, family income, and breast cancer stage at the diagnosis in this population.","Worry Among Latinx Young Adults: Relations to Pain Experience, Pain-Related Anxiety, and Perceived Health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102101,Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2019 05 18,"Latinx are one of the largest and most rapidly growing segments of the United States (U.S.) population that is significantly impacted by health disparities, including somatic health problems. Young Latinx adults (ages 18-25 years) are at a greater risk for being affected by such health inequalities and there is a need to understand individual-based differences that may contribute to and maintain somatic symptoms, including pain experience, pain beliefs, and perceptions of health. Thus, the current study investigated the explanatory role of worry in association between pain intensity, pain disability, pain-related anxiety, and perceived health among Latinx college students. Participants included 401 (Mage = 21 years; SD = 2.02; 83% female) Latinx students at a large, southwestern university. Results indicated that greater levels of worry were related to increased levels of pain intensity, pain disability, pain-related anxiety, and lower levels of perceived health. These findings were evident above and beyond variance accounted for by gender, age, physical functioning, and subjective social status. Overall, the results from the present investigation suggest that there is greater risk for more severe pain experiences, maladaptive beliefs regarding pain, and worse perceptions of health status among Latinx young adults who experience elevated levels of worry.",Regulation of growth performance and lipid metabolism in juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) with honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) extract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102099,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 05 18,"This study investigated the effects of honeysuckle extract (Lonicera japonica, HE) on the growth performance and lipid metabolism of juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). HE at doses of 10 g kg-1 (LHE), 20 g kg-1 (MHE), and 40 g kg-1 (HHE) were individually mixed with the basal diet and fed to grass carp for 10 weeks, and ginseng extract (20 g kg-1, GSE) was used as a positive control. The results showed that HE administration exerted no effect on growth performance, but the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and muscle and liver lipid contents were significantly decreased in the LHE and MHE groups. The serum levels of LDL-c, total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) also declined in the HE-treated groups. Moreover, the disordered vacuolization and nucleus migration in the liver were alleviated in the MHE and HHE groups, and mRNA expressions of lipogenesis-related genes, such as acc1, fas, srebp1, and pparγ decreased. Similarly, the expression of genes related to lipolysis, such as cpt1, atgl, lpl, and pparα, was found to be significantly increased in the MHE and HHE groups compared with the control. Taken together, HE can effectively improve the lipid metabolism and ameliorate the lipid deposition of grass carp and thus may be a promising feed additive in aquaculture."

Some of these so-called active material properties are generally characterised using isometric contraction experiments at various muscle lengths. In this context, experimental observations revealed that unlike the widespread assumption in muscle modelling, reaction forces indeed depend on so-called history effects, which can be classified into force enhancement and force depression. For the experimental settings of force enhancement, two subsequent isometric contractions are interrupted by an isokinetic extension. The isometric reaction force is increased after the isokinetic extension with respect to a reference measurement, while in the case of force depression, isokinetic shortening is responsible for forces below a certain isometric reference measurement. Most theoretical investigations of force enhancement and force depression use one-dimensional models to simulate the force response considering muscle deformation to be homogeneous. In contrast, the aim of the present study is to analyse history effects in skeletal muscle tissue using a three-dimensional geometry model of the whole muscle-tendon unit. Therefore, a purely phenomenological approach is presented. The model is implemented in the finite element framework to analyse history effects for the boundary value problem of the entire three-dimensional muscle-tendon geometry. The constitutive model shows good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, the simulations reveal information about the inhomogeneous stretch distributions within the muscle tissues.",On mechanically driven biological stimulus for bone remodeling as a diffusive phenomenon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102081,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2019 05 18,"In the past years, many attempts have been made in order to model the process of bone remodeling. This process is complex, as it is governed by not yet completely understood biomechanical coupled phenomena. It is well known that bone tissue is able to self-adapt to different environmental demands of both mechanical and biological origin. The mechanical aspects are related to the functional purpose of the bone tissue, i.e., to provide support to the body and protection for the vitally important organs in response to the external loads. The many biological aspects include the process of oxygen and nutrients supply. To describe the biomechanical process of functional adaptation of bone tissue, the approach commonly adopted is to consider it as a 'feedback' control regulated by the bone cells, namely osteoblasts and osteoclasts. They are responsible for bone synthesis and resorption, respectively, while osteocytes are in charge of 'sensing' the mechanical status of the tissue. Within this framework, in  Lekszycki and dell'Isola (ZAMM - Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 92(6):426-444, 2012), a model based on a system of integro-differential equations was introduced aiming to predict the evolution of the process of remodeling in surgically reconstructed bones. The main idea in the aforementioned model was to introduce a scalar field, describing the biological stimulus regulating the interaction among all kinds of bone cells at a macroscale. This biological field was assumed to depend locally on certain deformation measures of the (reconstructed) bone tissue. However, biological knowledge suggests that this stimulus, after having been produced, 'diffuses' in bone tissue, so controlling in a complex way its remodeling. This means that the cells which are target of the stimulus may not be located in the same place occupied by the cells producing it. In this paper, we propose a model which intends to explain the diffusive nature of the biological stimulus to encompass the time-dependent and space-time displaced effects involved in bone reconstruction process. Preliminary numerical simulations performed in typical cases are presented. These numerical case studies suggest that the 'diffusive' model of stimulus is promising: we plan to continue these kinds of studies in further investigations.",Usefulness of platelet-rich fibrin as a hemostatic agent after dental extractions in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy with factor Xa inhibitors: a case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102080,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 05 18,To evaluate the clinical outcomes of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) application for hemostasis after dental extraction in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy with factor Xa inhibitors.,The use of a poster to reduce expectations to receive antibiotics for a common cold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102079,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 05 18,"Many doctors prescribe antibiotics for a cold, to meet patient's expectations. As a result, patient's education about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance forms a major component of the WHO's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance. However, it is not known whether simple educational material can change a person's attitudes about antibiotic therapy. We designed three posters about antibiotic treatment for ""cold and flu"". Hospital inpatients answered a baseline survey and then were asked to look at one of three randomly selected posters. The posters highlighted the futility of antibiotic treatment for colds (futility), the risk of adverse drug reactions from antibiotics (harm), and the issue of antimicrobial resistance (resistance). Participants then completed a follow-up survey. Participants' expectations to receive antibiotics for a ""bad cold"" reduced significantly after viewing a poster (82/299, 27% expected antibiotics in the baseline survey compared with 13% in the follow-up survey, P < 0.01). Continuing expectation to receive antibiotics after viewing one of the posters was associated with expectation to receive antibiotics in the baseline survey and the strong belief that colds were caused by bacteria. Participants who viewed the resistance poster were more likely to continue to expect antibiotics than participants who viewed the futility poster (OR 2.46, 95%CI 1.16-5.20, P = 0.02). Following discussion of the study, viewing a poster reduced participants' expectations to receive antibiotics for a hypothetical cold.

Autophagy has been shown to play a role in HBV replication and the course of disease. More than 190 host genes have been identified that modify the process of autophagy, but which of these genes are involved in chronicity of HBV infection and how this occurs remains unclear. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were recruited to investigate the expression of autophagy-modulating genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). mRNA prepared from PBMCs from members of two families with clustering HBV infection, including 11 CHB patients and nine healthy spouses, was hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Immunoblot analysis was used to determine the level of autophagy. Of the 192 autophagy-modulating genes, 18 were found to be differently expressed. Of these, 11 displayed decreased expression in CHB patients, while seven displayed increased expression compared to those in healthy controls. Functional analysis showed that these genes are closely involved in initiation, nucleation, elongation of phagophores, formation of autophagosomes, transportation to lysosomes, and the process of degradation. Western blot analysis revealed inhibited autophagy in PBMCs based on decreased lipidation of LC3II. A differential expression profile of autophagy-modulating genes was observed, and decreased autophagy in PBMCs could be closely associated with chronicity of HBV infection, suggesting a novel strategy for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.",An isolate of sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus from Brazil with a distinct genome organization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102051,Archives of virology,2019 05 18,"Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; genus Crinivirus, family Closteroviridae), is an economically important pathogen of sweet potato.

A comparative analysis of the genome organization of SPCSV-UNB-01 and other SPCSV sequences showed that RNA1 was lacking p22, and p5.1 and that p5.2. was absent in RNA2, indicating a unique genomic pattern. SPCSV-UNB-01 contained longer p6 and p5 regions, with little similarity to orthologous sequences. Sequence comparison did not reveal any previously identified functional domains within these open reading frames (ORFs). No recombination or rearrangement events were detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the possibility of separate entries of SPCSV into South America based on the genetic distance between SPCSV-UNB-01 and the Peruvian isolate m2-47.

Several other metabolic disorders, stress, and inflammation generate free radicals and oxidative stress. It is essential to study whether oxidative stress independently enhances protein glycation leading to rapid establishment of secondary complications. Oxidative stress was experimentally induced using rotenone and Fenton reagent for in vivo and in vitro studies, respectively. Results showed significant increase in the rate of modification of BSA in the form of fructosamine and protein-bound carbonyls in the presence of fenton reagent. Circular dichroism studies revealed gross structural changes in the reduction of alpha helix structure and decreased protein surface charge was confirmed by zeta potential studies. Use of rotenone demonstrated enhanced AGE formation, ROS generation, and liver and kidney tissue glycation through fluorescence measurement. Similar findings were also observed in cell culture studies. Use of aminoguanidine, a protein glycation inhibitor, demonstrated reduction in these changes; however, a combination of aminoguanidine along with vitamin E demonstrated better amelioration. Thus, oxidative stress accelerates the process of protein glycation causing gross structural changes and tissue glycation in insulin-independent tissues. Use of antioxidants and protein glycation inhibitors in combination are more effective in preventing such changes and could be an effective therapeutic option for preventing establishment of secondary complications of diabetes.","Isolation of a 3-hydroxypyridine degrading bacterium, Agrobacterium sp. DW-1, and its proposed degradation pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102032,AMB Express,2019 06 10,"A 3-hydroxypyridine degrading bacterium, designated strain DW-1, was isolated from petroleum contaminated soil in Liao River China. 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicates that strain DW-1 belongs to genus Agrobacterium. The optimal cultivation temperature and pH for strain DW-1 with 3-hydroxypyridine were 30 °C and 8.0, respectively. Under optimal conditions, strain DW-1 could completely degrade up to 1500 mg/L of 3-hydroxypyridine in 66 h. The 3-hydroxypyridine degradation pathway of strain DW-1 was suggested by HPLC and LC-MS analysis. The first reaction of 3-hydroxypyridine degradation in strain DW-1 was α-hydroxylation so that the major metabolite 2,5-dihydroxypyridine was produced, and then 2,5-dihydroxypyridine was transformed by a Fe2+-dependent dioxygenase to form N-formylmaleamic acid. N-Formylmaleamic acid will be transformed to maleic acid and fumaric acid through maleamic acid. This is the first report of the 3-hydroxypyridine degradation pathway and the utilization of 3-hydroxypyridine by a Agrobacterium sp. It may be potentially used for the bioremediation of environments polluted with 3-hydroxypyridine.",Surveying the efficiency of Platanus orientalis bark as biosorbent for Ni and Cr(VI) removal from plating wastewater as a real sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102030,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 05 21,"Heavy metals make up one of the most important pollutants in industrial wastewater. For wastewater, adsorbent materials developed from suitable biomass can be effective in removing the heavy metal ions. In this study, the powder of the bark of Platanus orientalis was used as a biosorbent to remove Cr(VI) and Ni from a nickel-chromium plating wastewater as a real sample for the first time. Two different adsorbents were used in analyzing the data: modified and non-modified bark. The extent of adsorption was dependent on the pH (in the range of 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 9), the time of contact (in the range of 30, 60, 90, 120 min), and the adsorbent dosage (different doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 g L-1). The concentration of unabsorbed metals was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Model Thermo iCAP 6000). The maximum removal of Cr(VI) was obtained 89.6% for non-modified bark and 90.7% for modified bark both at pH of 5 in 2 g L-1 of adsorbent dosage in 300 min. While, the maximum Ni removal was obtained 74.5 and 56.5% for non-modified and modified bark, respectively, at pH 3 in 2 g L-1 adsorbent dosage in 90 min. Based on the results, Freundlich isotherm appears better fitted in adsorption with a better correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.998) than that of Langmuir model with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.996. The qmax for Ni1 and Ni2 were 126.58 and 285.714 mg g-1 and the qmax for Cr1 and Cr2 were 13.423 and 19.920 mg g-1, respectively. The FTIR studies indicated that S-O stretching group from sulfonate, surface O=H stretching, and also aliphatic C-H stretching are responsible for the adsorption. The SEM results obviously show the difference between the biomass surface before and after loading of ions. Ultimately, the present study concluded that P. orientalis could be a cheap and efficient biosorbent to adsorb and remove Cr(VI) and Ni from the plating wastewater; however, it seems more efficient for Cr(VI) with an average removal power of 90.15% than Ni with an average removal power of 65.75%.","Spatial Distribution of Perfluorinated Compounds in Atmosphere of the Pearl River Delta, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102029,Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 05 18,"Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are of special concern due to their environmental persistence and biotoxicity. In the present study, spatial distribution of PFCs in atmosphere of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of Southern China was investigated from November 2013 to January 2014. Forty-two air samples were collected using passive air samplers to determine the 13 target analytes, including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, C5-14) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs, C4, C6, and C8). Results showed that the total concentrations of PFCs (ΣPFCs) ranged from 53.7 to 225 pg m-3 with an average level of 122 ± 41.5 pg m-3, indicating a wide variation on ΣPFCs in atmosphere of the PRD. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant PFCs, followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA). PFOS, PFOA, PFPeA, and PFHpA accounted for 26%, 22%, 21%, and 19% of ΣPFCs, respectively. A general decline in ΣPFCs was observed in the atmosphere from south PRD to north PRD. It was likely related to the industrial distribution, population density, and wind direction. In addition, the same order of magnitude of PFOS and lower level of PFOA were observed in this study compared with those in atmosphere sampled in other regions. The lifetime risk indexes on the PFOS and PFOA concentrations were much less than unity, suggesting a lower nononcogenic risk to residents in the PRD.",Cognitive Assessment of Individuals with Multiple Sclerosis in the Arab World: a Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102028,Neuropsychology review,2019 05 18,"The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is on the rise globally, and recent epidemiological studies have observed increased rates in the Arab world (i.e., countries of North Africa and the Middle East where Arabic is the primary language). However, assessment of cognitive impairment and its relevant covariates (e.g., fatigue and depressive symptomatology) in the Arab world has not been rigorously reviewed. Thus, the objective of the present study was to systematically review the current use of cognitive assessment measures in observational and interventional studies of individuals with MS in the Arab world. A systematic review of studies that assessed cognitive function in adults with MS in the Arab world was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and Ovid Global Health. Studies that featured at least one objective cognitive measure were included. Eligible studies were reviewed for bias and study quality using the QUADAS-2 and NIH QAT. Study characteristics and finding were extracted by two independent reviewers, with results confirmed by a third reviewer. A total of 13 (N = 846) studies met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias and included measures varied across studies. Results demonstrated inconsistent availability and use of MS cognitive assessment tools across the Arab world. An Arabic version of the BICAMS was the only cognitive battery that was evaluated with regard to psychometric properties. The most common individual test include in reviewed studies was the SDMT. However, validation studies are still needed for this and a number of other measures. Other measures are still in the early stages of translation and cultural-linguistic norming. This review of cognitive assessment of individuals with MS in the Arab world was limited by variable study quality and measure selection. The present review provides a summary of the tests most commonly used in this region and recommendations for future investigation.",The effect of resistance training interventions on fundamental movement skills in youth: a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102027,Sports medicine - open,2019 06 10,"Fundamental movement skills (FMS) are strongly related to physical activity (PA) in childhood and beyond.

Silibinin, a natural flavonoid derived from milk thistle of Silybum marianum, has been reported to exert neuroprotective effect. In this study, rats were subjected to overtraining exercise, and the protective effects of silibinin were investigated in these models. Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests showed that silibinin significantly attenuated memory defects in overtrained rats. At the same time, the results of Nissl, TUNEL and SA-β-gal staining showed that silibinin reversed neuronal loss caused by apoptosis, and delayed cell senescence of the hippocampus in the overtrained rats, respectively. In addition, silibinin decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels which is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Silibinin prevented impairment of learning and memory caused by excessive physical exercise in rats, accompanied by reduced apoptosis and senescence in hippocampus cells."

So far, it is unclear whether GLUT5-mediated fructose utilization is important for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here, we demonstrated that GLUT5 was highly expressed in a panel of ccRCC cell lines. High GLUT5 expression exacerbated the neoplastic phenotypes of ccRCC cells, including cell proliferation and colony formation. On the other hand, deletion of the GLUT5-encoding gene SLC2A5 dramatically attenuated cellular malignancy via activating the apoptotic pathway. Moreover, administration of 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (2,5-AM), a competitive inhibitor of fructose uptake, could markedly suppress ccRCC cell growth. Together, we provide a new mechanistic insight for GLUT5-mediated fructose utilization in ccRCC cells and highlight the therapeutic potential for targeting this metabolic pathway against ccRCC.",Investigating the Effect of Cochlear Synaptopathy on Envelope Following Responses Using a Model of the Auditory Nerve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102010,Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology : JARO,2019 05 18,"The healthy auditory system enables communication in challenging situations with high levels of background noise. Yet, despite normal sensitivity to pure tones, many listeners complain about having difficulties in such situations. Recent animal studies demonstrated that noise overexposure that produces temporary threshold shifts can cause the loss of auditory nerve (AN) fiber synapses (i.e., cochlear synaptopathy, CS), which appears to predominantly affect medium- and low-spontaneous rate (SR) fibers. In the present study, envelope following response (EFR) magnitude-level functions were recorded in normal hearing (NH) threshold and mildly hearing-impaired (HI) listeners with thresholds elevated above 2 kHz. EFRs were elicited by sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tones presented in quiet with a carrier frequency of 2 kHz, modulated at 93 Hz, and modulation depths of 0.85 (deep) and 0.25 (shallow). While EFR magnitude-level functions for deeply modulated tones were similar for all listeners, EFR magnitudes for shallowly modulated tones were reduced at medium stimulation levels in some NH threshold listeners and saturated in all HI listeners for the whole level range. A phenomenological model of the AN was used to investigate the extent to which hair-cell dysfunction and/or CS could explain the trends observed in the EFR data. Hair-cell dysfunction alone, including postulated elevated hearing thresholds at extended high frequencies (EHF) beyond 8 kHz, could not account for the recorded EFR data. Postulated CS led to simulations generally consistent with the recorded data, but a loss of all types of AN fibers was required within the model framework. The effects of off-frequency contributions (i.e., away from the characteristic place of the stimulus) and the differential loss of different AN fiber types on EFR magnitude-level functions were analyzed. When using SAM tones in quiet as the stimulus, model simulations suggested that (1) EFRs are dominated by the activity of high-SR fibers at all stimulus intensities, and (2) EFRs at medium-to-high stimulus levels are dominated by off-frequency contributions.","Multicenter phase II study of trastuzumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin for chemotherapy-naïve, HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102009,Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,2019 05 18,"Trastuzumab with cisplatin and fluoropyrimidines improves overall survival (OS) in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (AGC).

On post-bleed day 20, a distal right anterior cerebral artery pseudoaneurysm along the EVD tract ruptured, which was successfully treated via clip-wrapping. Although EVD-associated pseudoaneurysms are rare, they have a high propensity for rupture.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has multiple effects on immune cells, inflammation and cancer. Besides, in previous studies, contradictory and uncertain results have been presented on the implication of Th17 cytokine profile in BC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma levels of MIF and the Th17 cytokine profile in BC and their association with their molecular subtypes and clinical stage. A total of 150 women with BC of Ella Binational Breast Cancer Study and 60 healthy women (HW) were evaluated in cross-sectional study. The molecular subtypes were identified by immunohistochemistry. The plasma levels of MIF were quantified by ELISA and Th17 cytokine profile by multiplex system. MIF and IL-17 were significantly increased in BC versus HW (11.1 vs. 5.2 ng/mL and 14.8 pg/mL vs. 2.5 pg/mL p < 0.001, respectively). Our analysis showed that both MIF and IL-17A were associated with increased risk of breast cancer (OR 3.85 CI 95% 1.98-7.50 and OR 4.51 95% 1.83-11.15, respectively), higher in aggressive subtypes Luminal B, HER2 and TN. Likewise, we observed positive correlation between MIF and IL-17A (p < 0.001). In addition, IL-17E was lower in BC versus HW (p <0.001). Likewise, we observed a positive correlation between MIF and IL-17A (p < 0.001). In conclusion, both MIF and IL-17A were associated with high risk for breast cancer and aggressive molecular subtypes.",Prediction of future weight change with dopamine transporter in patients with Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102003,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2019 06 10,"Fluctuating body weight is a commonly reported nonmotor feature in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesised that striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) density at the time of diagnosis might play an important role in weight regulation in patients with PD. DAT density was measured from 123I-FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography. Region-of-interest analyses were performed to measure the specific binding of 123I-FP-CIT to DAT, and the putamen-to-caudate nucleus ratio (PCR) was calculated. Body weight was measured at baseline (W0) and at 48 months (W48). We classified subjects into three groups: weight loss, stable, and weight gain. In final analyses, 163 patients (106 men, 57 women) were included. PCR significantly differed by group in men, but not in women or across all patients. In men, PCR was slightly negatively associated with the percentage change in weight. No such correlation was found across all patients or in women. In univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, low PCR was associated with future weight gain in men with PD but not in women. In conclusion, striatal DAT availability at the time of diagnosis could predict subsequent weight change in men with PD.",Laser-assisted endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy for failed back surgery syndrome in elderly patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102002,Lasers in medical science,2019 05 18,"Elderly patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) or post-laminectomy foraminal stenosis have a higher risk of perioperative morbidity with extensive revision surgery. Thus, there is a need for safer and less invasive surgical options, such as laser-assisted endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy (ELF). A pin-point laser beam can allow precise tissue ablation and dissection in fibrotic adhesion tissues while preventing normal tissue injury. The present study aimed to describe the surgical technique of laser-assisted ELF and to evaluate the clinical outcomes of elderly patients with FBSS. Two-year follow-up data were collected from 26 consecutive patients aged 65 years or older who were treated with laser-assisted ELF for FBSS. Full-endoscopic foraminal decompression was performed using a side-firing laser and mechanical instruments. The average age of the patients was 70.2 years (range, 65-83 years). The mean visual analog pain score for leg pain improved from 8.58 at baseline to 3.35 at 6 weeks, 2.19 at 1 year, and 2.35 at 2 years after ELF (P < 0.001). The mean Oswestry disability index improved from 65.93 at baseline to 31.41 at 6 weeks, 21.77 at 1 year, and 20.64 at 2 years after ELF (P < 0.001). Based on the modified Macnab criteria, excellent or good results were obtained in 84.6% patients and symptomatic improvements were obtained in 92.3%. Extensive revision surgery in elderly patients might cause significant surgical morbidities. Laser-assisted ELF under local anesthesia could be a safe and effective surgical alternative for such patients at risk."

Two insect collection sites were selected. The first site was the garden of the Faculty of Science, Moharram Bek, Alexandria University, which is considered a non-polluted site, and Khorshed district, considered as the polluted site. Percentages of heavy metals were estimated using SEM-X-ray microanalysis of soft tissues of both sexes of the two coleopteran insects. Esterase Isoenzymes were found to be overexpressed in B. Polycresta but not T. hispida. Female B. polycresta from the polluted site exhibited overexpression of the second and third loci. Furthermore, the females were found to be more affected than males, which only showed the overexpression of the second loci. T. hispida (females and males) collected from the reference site were found to have increased esterase activity compared with those sampled from the polluted site. The Snake-Skin™ Dialysis tubing technique, used for optimizing the protein extraction method, reflected the highest quantified proteins compared to other, traditional methods. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of the whole-body protein reflected definite variations between T. hispida and B. polycresta in fraction number and activity at the two sites. Varied expression levels for metallothionein (MT) heavy metal resistance proteins for B. polycresta and T. hispida were also detected in the study. Based on these results, we suggest that biochemical biomarkers could infer environmental hazards, B. polycresta and T. hispida are successful biomarkers for heavy metal pollution.",An Effective Design of Wearable Antenna with Double Flexible Substrates and Defected Ground Structure for Healthcare Monitoring System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101989,Journal of medical systems,2019 05 21,"Due to the development of modern wearable mobile devices, the need of antenna with smaller size and internally flexible to fit becomes necessary. Miniaturization of Micro Strip Patch (MSP) antenna increases its employability for communication in different aspects. The use of flexible material for the fabrication of MSP antenna still improves its use for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) which includes devices for monitoring systems in military, surveillance and medical applications.

This entity occurs commonly during and after critical care stay. Various causal factors for functional incapacity have been proposed. Among these, individual patient characteristics (such as age, comorbidities and nutritional status), acting in association with sustained bed rest and pharmacological interventions (included the metabolic support approach), seem influential in reducing muscular mass. Long-term outcomes in heterogeneous ICUAW populations include transient disability in 30% of patients and persistent disabilities that may occur even in patients with nearly complete functional recovery. Currently available tools for the assessment of skeletal muscle mass are imprecise and difficult to perform in the ICU setting. A valid alternative to these imaging modalities is muscular ultrasonography, which allows visualization and classification of muscle characteristics by cross-sectional area, muscle layer thickness, echointensity by grayscale and the pennation angle).

An allergic asthma mouse model was generated by challenging with ovalbumin (OVA); lung pathological features of mice were viewed using H&E staining; thickness of subepithelial fibrosis and smooth muscle was measured using Masson's trichrome staining. Inflammatory cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were counted based on Diff-Quik staining and morphometric analysis. Expressions of miR-943-3p, SFRP4 and Wnt signal pathway-associated proteins were detected using RT-PCR or immunoblotting, respectively. SFRP4 was downregulated in the bronchial biopsies of allergic asthma patients and represented a unique intersection between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and genes in the Wnt signal pathway. Both miR-943-3p upregulation and SFRP4 downregulation were detected in allergic asthma patients and OVA-induced mice. Besides, OVA-induced mice possessed more inflammatory cells in BALF including macrophage (mac), eosinophil (eos), lymphocyte (lym) and neutrophil (neu), higher expression of collagen, β-catenin and c-Myc as well as thicker subepithelial fibrosis and smooth muscle in lung than control mice. In vivo delivery of miR-943-3p agomir worsened these symptoms, while both miR-943-3p antagomir and Ad-SFRP4 administration effectively alleviated this disease. Taken together, miR-943-3p accelerated the progression of airway inflammation and remodeling in allergic asthma via suppressing the activity of SFRP4 through Wnt signaling pathway in asthma patients and OVA-induced mice.",Sarcoidosis and Work Participation: The Need to Develop a Disease-Specific Core Set for Assessment of Work Ability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101981,Lung,2019 05 18,"Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory multi-organ disease with a wide variety of clinical manifestations, affecting people of working age.

However, neither the ACR 2016 nor its predecessor ACR 2010 criteria have been validated in a referral setting. We hypothesized that the presence of higher comorbidities in the referral care setting may affect the performance of the ACR 2016. All patients referred to a tertiary care hospital with widespread pain for more than 3 months were screened using (1) the ACR 2016 criteria and (2) by a blinded expert physician (using ACR 1990 criteria). Using the ACR 1990 as reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Also, concomitant depression (BPHQ: Brief Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety disorder (GAD7: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and alexithymia (TAS-20: Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20) were screened for using standardized instruments. Other central sensitization syndromes were also screened clinically. Of 147 patients (132 females; median age 36 [30-45] years, median symptom duration 4 [1-6] years), 112 met the ACR 1990 criteria while 93 met the ACR 2016 criteria. There was disagreement between the two criteria in 47 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of ACR 2016 were 71% and 60%, respectively. Patients diagnosed by ACR 2016 criteria alone, had higher GAD7 scores than those diagnosed by the ACR 1990 alone. However, BPHQ and TAS-20 did not differ between the groups.

Precisely how mitochondrial dysfunction is initiated and whether it contributes to insulin resistance in this tissue remains a poorly resolved issue. Herein, we examine the contribution that an increase in proinflammatory NFkB signalling makes towards regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, morphology, and dynamics and its impact upon insulin action in skeletal muscle cells subject to chronic fuel (glucose and palmitate) overloading. We show sustained nutrient excess of L6 myotubes promotes activation of the IKKβ-NFkB pathway (as judged by a six-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA expression; an NFkB target gene) and that this was associated with a marked reduction in mitochondrial respiratory capacity (>50%), a three-fold increase in mitochondrial fragmentation and 2.5-fold increase in mitophagy. Under these circumstances, we also noted a reduction in the mRNA and protein abundance of PGC1α and that of key mitochondrial components (SDHA, ANT-1, UCP3, and MFN2) as well as an increase in cellular ROS and impaired insulin action in myotubes. Strikingly, pharmacological or genetic repression of NFkB activity ameliorated disturbances in mitochondrial respiratory function/morphology, attenuated loss of SDHA, ANT-1, UCP3, and MFN2 and mitigated the increase in ROS and the associated reduction in myotube insulin sensitivity. Our findings indicate that sustained oversupply of metabolic fuel to skeletal muscle cells induces heightened NFkB signalling and that this serves as a critical driver for disturbances in mitochondrial function and morphology, redox status, and insulin signalling.",Targeted enzyme delivery systems in lysosomal disorders: an innovative form of therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101939,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 05 18,"Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), which are inherited lysosomal storage disorders caused by the accumulation of undegraded glycosaminoglycans, can affect the central nervous system (CNS) and elicit cognitive and behavioral issues.

Three predominant types of arginine-guanidino methylation occur in Eukarya: mono (Rme1/MMA), symmetric (Rme2s/SDMA), and asymmetric (Rme2a/ADMA). Arginine methylation frequently occurs at sites of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, providing specificity for binding partners and stabilization of important biological interactions in diverse cellular processes. Each methylarginine isoform-catalyzed by members of the protein arginine methyltransferase family, Type I (PRMT1-4,6,8) and Type II (PRMT5,9)-has unique downstream consequences. Methylarginines are found in ordered domains, domains of low complexity, and in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins-the latter two of which are intimately connected with biological liquid-liquid phase separation. This review highlights discoveries illuminating how arginine methylation affects genome integrity, gene transcription, mRNA splicing and mRNP biology, protein translation and stability, and phase separation. As more proteins and processes are found to be regulated by arginine methylation, its importance for understanding cellular physiology will continue to grow.",Antiviral peptides as promising therapeutic drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101936,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 05 18,"While scientific advances have led to large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses still remain a major cause of human diseases today. The ever-increasing reports of viral resistance and the emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics pressure the health and scientific community to constantly find novel molecules with antiviral potential. This search involves numerous different approaches, and the use of antimicrobial peptides has presented itself as an interesting alternative. Even though the number of antimicrobial peptides with antiviral activity is still low, they already show immense potential to become pharmaceutically available antiviral drugs. Such peptides can originate from natural sources, such as those isolated from mammals and from animal venoms, or from artificial sources, when bioinformatics tools are used.

NPCs are highly migratory and traverse the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb, where they terminally differentiate into mature interneurons. NPCs from the SVZ are some of the few cells in the CNS that migrate long distances during adulthood. The migratory process of NPCs is highly regulated by intracellular pathway activation and signaling from the surrounding microenvironment. It involves modulation of cell volume, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and isolation from compact extracellular matrix. In malignant brain tumors including high-grade gliomas, there are cells called brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) with similar stem cell characteristics to NPCs but with uncontrolled cell proliferation and contribute to tumor initiation capacity, tumor progression, invasion, and tumor maintenance. These BTSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and their presence is believed to lead to tumor recurrence at distal sites from the original tumor location, principally due to their high migratory capacity. BTSCs are able to invade the brain parenchyma by utilizing many of the migratory mechanisms used by NPCs. However, they have an increased ability to infiltrate the tight brain parenchyma and utilize brain structures such as myelin tracts and blood vessels as migratory paths. In this article, we summarize recent findings on the mechanisms of cellular migration that overlap between NPCs and BTSCs. A better understanding of the intersection between NPCs and BTSCs will to provide a better comprehension of the BTSCs' invasive capacity and the molecular mechanisms that govern their migration and eventually lead to the development of new therapies to improve the prognosis of patients with malignant gliomas.",Implant Insertion Time and Incision Length in Breast Augmentation Surgery with the Keller Funnel: Results from a Comparative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101933,Aesthetic plastic surgery,2019 05 18,The Keller funnel is an easy-to-use mechanical device that aids breast implant insertion.

Phthalate diesters leach out of these products and ultimately enter biological systems where they are quickly metabolized to phthalate monoesters and glucuronides. As such, phthalate monoesters can serve as indicators of anthropogenic activity in wilderness areas. The Okavango Delta, an inland seasonal wetland covering 5000-12,000 km2 in Botswana, provides fresh water to many species of birds, fish, reptiles, and large mammals. Water samples (N = 46) were taken from across the Okavango water system, extracted, and analyzed for eight different phthalate monoesters using liquid chromatography and isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Seven of eight phthalate monoesters were detected from the low ng/L to low µg/L levels. Phthalate monoesters were found in samples from all five sampling regions. Sources of these contaminants are unknown, but their presence indicates encroachment of human activity on the Okavango Delta.","Research Progress of Mercury Bioaccumulation in the Aquatic Food Chain, China: A Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101929,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 05 23,"Research on mercury (Hg) in aquatic ecosystems in China has focused mainly on fish, with little research on the base of the food chain and Hg bioaccumulation mechanisms.

A comparison of fish samples in China between 2000 and 2018 indicates that their total Hg content remains at relatively safe levels. However, because current information is generally insufficient to confirm how anthropogenic activities affect transformation and bioaccumulation in the aqueous environment, Hg isotope studies should be a focus of research on aquatic food webs. Additionally, more attention should be paid to Hg transport and bioaccumulation in the basic food chain by focusing on multi-contaminant joint exposure studies and establishing Hg bio-transport models."

Recently, UdgX, an unconventional UDG with extremely tight binding to DNA containing uracil, was discovered. The structure of UdgX from Mycobacterium smegmatis in complex with DNA shows an overall similarity to that of family 4 UDGs except for a protruding loop at the entrance of the uracil-binding pocket. Surprisingly, H109 in the loop was found to make a covalent bond to the abasic site to form a stable intermediate, while the excised uracil remained in the pocket of the active site. H109 functions as a nucleophile to attack the oxocarbenium ion, substituting for the catalytic water molecule found in other UDGs. To our knowledge, this change from a catalytic water attack to a direct nucleophilic attack by the histidine residue is unprecedented. UdgX utilizes a unique mechanism of protecting cytotoxic abasic sites from exposure to the cellular environment.",Natural fumigation as a mechanism for volatile transport between flower organs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101916,Nature chemical biology,2019 05 18,"Plants synthesize volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to attract pollinators and beneficial microorganisms, to defend themselves against herbivores and pathogens, and for plant-plant communication. In general, VOCs accumulate in and are emitted from the tissue of their biosynthesis. However, using biochemical and reverse genetic approaches, we demonstrate a new physiological phenomenon: inter-organ aerial transport of VOCs via natural fumigation. Before petunia flowers open, a tube-specific terpene synthase produces sesquiterpenes, which are released inside the buds and then accumulate in the stigma, potentially defending the developing stigma from pathogens. These VOCs also affect reproductive organ development and seed yield, which are previously unknown functions of terpenoid compounds.",Suicide inactivation of the uracil DNA glycosylase UdgX by covalent complex formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101915,Nature chemical biology,2019 05 18,"A uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsmUdgX) shares sequence similarity with family 4 UDGs and forms exceedingly stable complexes with single-stranded uracil-containing DNAs (ssDNA-Us) that are resistant to denaturants. However, MsmUdgX has been reported to be inactive in excising uracil from ssDNA-Us and the underlying structural basis is unclear. Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of MsmUdgX in the free, uracil- and DNA-bound forms, respectively. The structural information, supported by mutational and biochemical analyses, indicates that the conserved residue His109 located on a characteristic loop forms an irreversible covalent linkage with the deoxyribose at the apyrimidinic site of ssDNA-U, thus rendering the enzyme unable to regenerate. By proposing the catalytic pathway and molecular mechanism for MsmUdgX, our studies provide an insight into family 4 UDGs and UDGs in general.",Analysis of extracellular vesicles generated from monocytes under conditions of lytic cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101910,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are an important class of membrane-bound structures that have been widely investigated for their roles in intercellular communication in the contexts of tumor progression, vascular function, immunity and regenerative medicine. Much of the current knowledge on the functions of EVs pertains to those derived from viable cells (e.g. exosomes and microvesicles) or apoptotic cells (e.g. apoptotic bodies) whilst the generation of EVs from dying cells under non-apoptotic conditions remains poorly characterized. Herein, the release of EVs from THP-1 monocytes under conditions of primary necrosis, secondary necrosis and pyroptosis, was investigated. A comprehensive analysis of THP-1-derived EVs revealed that cells undergoing lytic forms of cell death generated a high number of EVs compared with viable or apoptotic cells in vitro. Differential centrifugation via 16,000 g and 100,000 g revealed that dying THP-1 cells release both medium and small EVs, respectively, consistent with the known characteristics of microvesicles and/or exosomes. In addition, large EVs isolated via 2000 g centrifugation were also present in all samples. These findings suggest that lytic cell death under both sterile and non-sterile inflammatory conditions induces monocytes to generate EVs, which could potentially act as mediators of cell-to-cell communication.",Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays a pathogenic role in BSA-induced kidney injury in diabetic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101909,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is appeared to be higher risk of declining kidney function compared to non-diabetic kidney disease with same magnitude of albuminuria.

Caveolin-1 (CAV1), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and integrin β1 have shown to be involved in EMT program. Here, we found diabetic kidney is prone for albuminuria-induced TECs damage and DPP-4 plays a vital role in such parenchymal damages in diabetic mice. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) injection induced severe TECs damage and altered expression levels of DPP-4, integrin β1, CAV1, and EMT programs including relevant microRNAs in type 1 diabetic CD-1 mice when compared to non-diabetic mice; teneligliptin (TENE) ameliorated these alterations. TENE suppressed the close proximity among DPP-4, integrin β1 and CAV1 in a culture of HK-2 cells. These findings suggest that DPP-4 inhibition can be relevant for combating proteinuric DKD by targeting the EMT program induced by the crosstalk among DPP-4, integrin β1 and CAV1.",Induction of neoantigen-reactive T cells from healthy donors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101906,Nature protocols,2019 05 30,"The identification of immunogenic neoantigens and their cognate T cells represents the most crucial and rate-limiting steps in the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies that are based on vaccination or on infusion of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells. Recent advances in deep-sequencing technologies and in silico prediction algorithms have allowed rapid identification of candidate neoepitopes. However, large-scale validation of putative neoepitopes and the isolation of reactive T cells are challenging because of the limited availablity of patient material and the low frequencies of neoepitope-specific T cells. Here we describe a standardized protocol for the induction of neoepitope-reactive T cells from healthy donor T cell repertoires, unaffected by the potentially immunosuppressive environment of the tumor-bearing host. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with mRNA encoding candidate neoepitopes are used to prime autologous naive CD8+ T cells. Antigen-specific T cells that recognize endogenously processed and presented epitopes are detected using peptide-MHC (pMHC) multimers. Single multimer-positive T cells are sorted for the identification of TCR sequences, after an optional step that includes clonal expansion and functional characterization. The time required to identify neoepitope-specific T cells is 15 d, with an additional 2-4 weeks required for clonal expansion and downstream functional characterization. Identified neoepitopes and corresponding TCRs provide candidates for use in vaccination and TCR-based cancer immunotherapies, and datasets generated by this technology should be useful for improving algorithms to predict immunogenic neoantigens.",A nanostructure platform for live-cell manipulation of membrane curvature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101905,Nature protocols,2019 05 30,"Membrane curvatures are involved in essential cellular processes, such as endocytosis and exocytosis, in which they are believed to act as microdomains for protein interactions and intracellular signaling. These membrane curvatures appear and disappear dynamically, and their locations are difficult or impossible to predict. In addition, the size of these curvatures is usually below the diffraction limit of visible light, making it impossible to resolve their values using live-cell imaging. Therefore, precise manipulation of membrane curvature is important to understanding how membrane curvature is involved in intracellular processes. Recent studies show that membrane curvatures can be induced by surface topography when cells are in direct contact with engineered substrates. Here, we present detailed procedures for using nanoscale structures to manipulate membrane curvatures and probe curvature-induced phenomena in live cells. We first describe detailed procedures for the design of nanoscale structures and their fabrication using electron-beam (E-beam) lithography. The fabrication process takes 2 d, but the resultant chips can be cleaned and reused repeatedly over the course of 2 years. Then we describe how to use these nanostructures to manipulate local membrane curvatures and probe intracellular protein responses, discussing surface coating, cell plating, and fluorescence imaging in detail. Finally, we describe a procedure to characterize the nanostructure-cell membrane interface using focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). Nanotopography-based methods can induce stable membrane curvatures with well-defined curvature values and locations in live cells, which enables the generation of a library of curvatures for probing curvature-related intracellular processes.",MARS-seq2.0: an experimental and analytical pipeline for indexed sorting combined with single-cell RNA sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101904,Nature protocols,2019 05 30,"Human tissues comprise trillions of cells that populate a complex space of molecular phenotypes and functions and that vary in abundance by 4-9 orders of magnitude. Relying solely on unbiased sampling to characterize cellular niches becomes infeasible, as the marginal utility of collecting more cells diminishes quickly. Furthermore, in many clinical samples, the relevant cell types are scarce and efficient processing is critical. We developed an integrated pipeline for index sorting and massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (MARS-seq2.0) that builds on our previously published MARS-seq approach. MARS-seq2.0 is based on >1 million cells sequenced with this pipeline and allows identification of unique cell types across different tissues and diseases, as well as unique model systems and organisms. Here, we present a detailed step-by-step procedure for applying the method. In the improved procedure, we combine sub-microliter reaction volumes, optimization of enzymatic mixtures and an enhanced analytical pipeline to substantially lower the cost, improve reproducibility and reduce well-to-well contamination. Data analysis combines multiple layers of quality assessment and error detection and correction, graphically presenting key statistics for library complexity, noise distribution and sequencing saturation. Importantly, our combined FACS and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) workflow enables intuitive approaches for depletion or enrichment of cell populations in a data-driven manner that is essential to efficient sampling of complex tissues. The experimental protocol, from cell sorting to a ready-to-sequence library, takes 2-3 d. Sequencing and processing the data through the analytical pipeline take another 1-2 d.",Cyclic magma recharge pulses detected by high-precision strainmeter data: the case of 2017 inter-eruptive activity at Etna volcano.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101902,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Unprecedented ultra-small strain changes (~10-8-10-9), preceding and accompanying the 2017 explosive-effusive activity, were revealed by a high precision borehole strainmeter at Etna. No pre- or co-eruptive deformation was detected by the GPS measurements, which often fail to detect ground deformation engendered by short-term small volcanic events due to their limited accuracy (millimetres to few centimetres). Through the analysis and detection of ultra-small strain changes (few tens of nanostrain), revealed by filtering the raw data, a significant time correspondence with the eruptive activity is observed. For the first time, cyclic fast exponential strain changes, preceding the onset of eruptive events, with a timescale of about 2-7 days, were detected. These variations are attributable to the expansion of the shallow magma reservoir, which is replenished with new magma from depth during the inter-eruptive periods. Interpreting the strain changes in terms of pressurization/depressurization of the chamber due to the cyclic influx and withdrawal of magma, allows placing some constraints on the magma recharge volume rate. A Finite Element model has been developed to simulate the temporal evolution of the strain changes generated by the re-pressurization of a spheroidal magma source using a dynamical approach. An average total mass budget of about 1-2 × 109 kg, which is in the range of the erupted mass, is estimated to be accumulated within a shallow vertically elongated magma chamber during the inter-eruptive periods. Such evidence demonstrates that the near-real time analysis of strainmeter records is remarkable for its ability to record small transients and highlight recharging phases preceding eruptive activity, which would go undetected with other current methodologies. Under these conditions, the ability to simulate inter-eruptive periods offers an opportunity to estimate the magma recharge rate with important implications for volcano hazard assessment.",Misophonia is associated with altered brain activity in the auditory cortex and salience network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101901,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Misophonia is characterized by intense rage and disgust provoked by hearing specific human sounds resulting in social isolation due to avoidance. We exposed patients with symptom provoking audiovisual stimuli to investigate brain activity of emotional responses. 21 patients with misophonia and 23 matched healthy controls were recruited at the psychiatry department of the Amsterdam UMC. Participants were presented with three different conditions, misophonia related cues (video clips with e.g. lip smacking and loud breathing), aversive cues (violent or disgusting clips from movies), and neutral cues (video clips of e.g. someone meditating) during fMRI. Electrocardiography was recorded to determine physiological changes and self-report measures were used to assess emotional changes. Misophonic cues elicited anger, disgust and sadness in patients compared to controls. Emotional changes were associated with increases in heart rate. The neuroimaging data revealed increased activation of the right insula, right anterior cingulate cortex and right superior temporal cortex during viewing of the misophonic video clips compared to neutral clips. Our results demonstrate that audiovisual stimuli trigger anger and physiological arousal in patients with misophonia, associated with activation of the auditory cortex and salience network."
