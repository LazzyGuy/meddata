Dehydrins (DHNs) are abiotic stresses resistant proteins in planta, which are associated with adaptive evolution.

South African Rediviva longimanus bees exhibit elongated forelegs, a bizarre adaptation for collecting oil from floral spurs of their Diascia hosts. Furthermore, R. longimanus foreleg length (FLL) differs significantly among populations, which has been hypothesised to result from selection imposed by inter-population variation in Diascia floral spur length. Here, we used a pooled restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (pooled RAD-seq) approach to investigate the population genetic structure of R. longimanus and to test if phenotypic differences in FLL translate into increased genetic differentiation (i) between R. longimanus populations and (ii) between phenotypes across populations. We also inferred the effects of demographic processes on population genetic structure and tested for genetic markers underpinning local adaptation. RESULTS: Populations showed marked genetic differentiation (average FST = 0.165), though differentiation was not statistically associated with differences between populations in FLL. All populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and were inferred to have gone through recent bottleneck events, suggesting extremely low effective population sizes. Genetic differentiation between samples pooled by leg length (short versus long) rather than by population of origin was even higher (FST = 0.260) than between populations, suggesting reduced interbreeding between long and short-legged individuals. Signatures of selection were detected in 1119 (3.8%) of a total of 29,721 SNP markers, CONCLUSIONS: Populations of R. longimanus appear to be small, bottlenecked and isolated. Though we could not detect the effect of local adaptation (FLL in response to floral spurs of host plants) on population genetic differentiation, short and long legged bees appeared to be partially differentiated, suggesting incipient ecological speciation. To test this hypothesis, greater resolution through the use of individual-based whole-genome analyses is now needed to quantify the degree of reproductive isolation between long and short legged bees between and even within populations.",Genome-Wide Expression Profiling Unveils Autoimmune Response Signatures in the Perivascular Adipose Tissue of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567485,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 23,"Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is thought to play a role in vascular homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of large vessel diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Herein, we tested the hypothesis that locally restricted transcriptional profiles characterize PVAT surrounding AAA, indicating specific dysfunctions associated with the disease. Approach and Results- Using a paired sample design to limit the effects of interindividual variation, we performed a microarray-based investigation of the PVAT transcriptome in 30 patients with AAA, comparing the adipose layer of the dilated abdominal aorta with that of the not-dilated aortic neck in each patient. Furthermore, we used a state-of-the-art data mining procedure to remove the effect of confounders produced by high-throughput gene expression techniques. We found substantial differences in PVAT gene expression clearly distinguishing the dilated from the not-dilated aorta, which increased in number and magnitude with increasing AAA diameter. Comparisons with other adipose depots (omental or subcutaneous fat) confirmed that gene expression changes are locally restricted. We dissected putative mechanisms associated with AAA PVAT dysfunction through a functional enrichment network analysis: both innate and adaptive immune-response genes along with genes related to cell-death pathways, metabolic processes of collagen, sphingolipids, aminoglycans, and extracellular matrix degradation were strongly overrepresented in PVAT of AAA compared with PVAT of the not-dilated aorta. Conclusions- Our results support a possible function of PVAT in AAA pathogenesis and suggest that AAA is an immunologic disease with an underlying autoimmune component. Interfering with these disease-specific pathways would clarify their precise role in AAA pathogenesis.",TCF7L2 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2) Regulation of GATA6 (GATA-Binding Protein 6)-Dependent and -Independent Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Plasticity and Intimal Hyperplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567484,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 06 10,"Objective- TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) is a Wnt-regulated transcription factor that maintains stemness and promotes proliferation in embryonic tissues and adult stem cells. Mice with a coronary artery disease-linked mutation in Wnt-coreceptor LRP6 (LDL receptor-related protein 6) exhibit vascular smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation and obstructive coronary artery disease, which are paradoxically associated with reduced TCF7L2 expression. We conducted a comprehensive study to explore the role of TCF7L2 in vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation and protection against intimal hyperplasia. Approach and Results- Using multiple mouse models, we demonstrate here that TCF7L2 promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. TCF7L2 accomplishes these effects by stabilization of GATA6 (GATA-binding protein 6) and upregulation of SM-MHC (smooth muscle cell myosin heavy chain) and cell cycle inhibitors. Accordingly, TCF7L2 haploinsufficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility to injury-induced hyperplasia, while mice overexpressing TCF7L2 were protected against injury-induced intimal hyperplasia compared with wild-type littermates. Consequently, the overexpression of TCF7L2 in LRP6 mutant mice rescued the injury-induced intimal hyperplasia. Conclusions- Our novel findings imply cell type-specific functional role of TCF7L2 and provide critical insight into mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia.",Perivascular Adipocytes Store Norepinephrine by Vesicular Transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567483,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 06 10,"Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contains an independent adrenergic system that can take up, metabolize, release, and potentially synthesize the vasoactive catecholamine norepinephrine. Norepinephrine has been detected in PVAT, but the mechanism of its protection within this tissue is unknown. Here, we investigate whether PVAT adipocytes can store norepinephrine using VMAT (vesicular monoamine transporter). Approach and Results- High-performance liquid chromatography identified norepinephrine in normal male Sprague Dawley rat aortic, superior mesenteric artery, and mesenteric resistance vessel PVATs, and retroperitoneal fat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed VMAT1 and VMAT2 mRNA expression in the adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction of mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of VMAT1 and VMAT2, and the colocalization of VMAT2 with norepinephrine, in the cytoplasm of adipocytes in mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT. A protocol was developed to capture real-time uptake of Mini 202-a functional and fluorescent VMAT probe-in live rat PVAT adipocytes. Mini 202 was taken up by freshly isolated and differentiated adipocytes from mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT and adipocytes from thoracic aortic and superior mesenteric artery PVATs. In adipocytes freshly isolated from mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT, addition of rose bengal (VMAT inhibitor), nisoxetine (norepinephrine transporter inhibitor), or corticosterone (organic cation 3 transporter inhibitor) significantly reduced Mini 202 signal. Immunofluorescence supports that neither VMAT1 nor VMAT2 is present in retroperitoneal adipocytes, suggesting that PVAT adipocytes may be unique in storing norepinephrine. Conclusions- This study supports a novel function of PVAT adipocytes in storing amines in a VMAT-dependent manner. It provides a foundation for future studies exploring the purpose and mechanisms of norepinephrine storage by PVAT in normal physiology and obesity-related hypertension.",Loss of 2 Akt (Protein Kinase B) Isoforms in Hematopoietic Cells Diminished Monocyte and Macrophage Survival and Reduces Atherosclerosis in Ldl Receptor-Null Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567482,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 04 24,"Objective- Macrophages express 3 Akt (protein kinase B) isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, which display isoform-specific functions but may be redundant in terms of Akt survival signaling. We hypothesize that loss of 2 Akt isoforms in macrophages will suppress their ability to survive and modulate the development of atherosclerosis. Approach and Results- To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted male Ldlr-/- mice with double Akt2/Akt3 knockout hematopoietic cells expressing only the Akt1 isoform (Akt1only). There were no differences in body weight and plasma lipid levels between the groups after 8 weeks of the Western diet; however, Akt1only→ Ldlr-/- mice developed smaller (57.6% reduction) atherosclerotic lesions with more apoptotic macrophages than control mice transplanted with WT (wild type) cells. Next, male and female Ldlr-/- mice were reconstituted with double Akt1/Akt2 knockout hematopoietic cells expressing the Akt3 isoform (Akt3only). Female and male Akt3only→ Ldlr-/- recipients had significantly smaller (61% and 41%, respectively) lesions than the control WT→ Ldlr-/- mice. Loss of 2 Akt isoforms in hematopoietic cells resulted in markedly diminished levels of white blood cells, B cells, and monocytes and compromised viability of monocytes and peritoneal macrophages compared with WT cells. In response to lipopolysaccharides, macrophages with a single Akt isoform expressed low levels of inflammatory cytokines; however, Akt1only macrophages were distinct in expressing high levels of antiapoptotic Il10 compared with WT and Akt3only cells. Conclusions- Loss of 2 Akt isoforms in hematopoietic cells, preserving only a single Akt1 or Akt3 isoform, markedly compromises monocyte and macrophage viability and diminishes early atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice.",CD36 Enhances Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation and Development of Neointimal Hyperplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567481,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 26,"Objective- Dysregulated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) plays an essential role in neointimal hyperplasia. CD36 functions critically in atherogenesis and thrombosis. We hypothesize that CD36 regulates VSMC proliferation and contributes to the development of obstructive vascular diseases. Approach and Results- We found by immunofluorescent staining that CD36 was highly expressed in human vessels with obstructive diseases. Using guidewire-induced carotid artery injury and shear stress-induced intima thickening models, we compared neointimal hyperplasia in Apoe-/-, Cd36-/- /Apoe-/-, and CD36 specifically deleted in VSMC (VSMC cd36-/-) mice. CD36 deficiency, either global or VSMC-specific, dramatically reduced injury-induced neointimal thickening. Correspondingly, carotid artery blood flow was significantly increased in Cd36-/- /Apoe-/- compared with Apoe-/- mice. In cultured VSMCs from thoracic aorta of wild-type and Cd36-/- mice, we found that loss of CD36 significantly decreased serum-stimulated proliferation and increased cell populations in S phase, suggesting that CD36 is necessary for VSMC S/G2-M-phase transition. Treatment of VSMCs with a TSR (thrombospondin type 1 repeat) peptide significantly increased wild-type, but not Cd36-/- VSMC proliferation. TSR or serum treatment significantly increased cyclin A expression in wild-type, but not in Cd36-/- VSMCs. STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription), which reportedly enhances both VSMC differentiation and maturation, was higher in Cd36-/- VSMCs. CD36 deficiency significantly decreased expression of Col1A1 (type 1 collagen A1 chain) and TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), and increased expression of contractile proteins, including calponin 1 and smooth muscle α actin, and dramatically increased cell contraction. Conclusions- CD36 promotes VSMC proliferation via upregulation of cyclin A expression that contributes to the development of neointimal hyperplasia, collagen deposition, and obstructive vascular diseases."

Initially, they were used in education and clinical practice settings to develop them further and to determine their usefulness in those settings. Since that time, changes have been made with additional assumptions, variant characteristics of culture, and an extensive assessment guide that can be used by all health professionals.",Beauty Is in the Eye of the Beholder: The Appraisal of Facial Attractiveness and Its Relation to Conscious Awareness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567468,Perception,2019 03 20,"Previous research suggests that facial attractiveness relies on features such as symmetry, averageness and above-average sexual dimorphic characteristics. Due to the evolutionary and sociobiological value of these characteristics, it has been suggested that attractiveness can be processed in the absence of conscious awareness. This raises the possibility that attractiveness can also be appraised without conscious awareness. In this study, we addressed this hypothesis. We presented neutral and emotional faces that were rated high, medium and low for attractiveness during a pilot experimental stage. We presented these faces for 33.33 ms with backwards masking to a black and white pattern for 116.67 ms and measured face-detection and emotion-discrimination performance, and attractiveness ratings. We found that high-attractiveness faces were detected and discriminated more accurately and rated higher for attractiveness compared with other appearance types. A Bayesian analysis of signal detection performance indicated that faces were not processed significantly at-chance. Further assessment revealed that correct detection (hits) of a presented face was a necessary condition for reporting higher ratings for high-attractiveness faces. These findings suggest that the appraisal of attractiveness requires conscious awareness.",The role of Peripheral Vision in the Flashed Face Distortion Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567467,Perception,2019 03 20,"The flashed face distortion effect is a phenomenon whereby images of faces, presented at 4-5 Hz in the visual periphery, appear distorted. It has been hypothesized that the effect is driven by cortical, rather than retinal, components. Here, we investigated the role of peripheral viewing on the effect. Normally sighted participants viewed the stimulus peripherally, centrally, and centrally with a blurring lens (to match visual acuity in the peripheral location). Participants rated the level of distortion using a Visual Analogue Scale. Although optical defocus did have a significant effect on distortion ratings, peripheral viewing had a much greater effect, despite matched visual acuity. We suggest three potential mechanisms for this finding: increased positional uncertainty in the periphery, reduced deployment of attention to the visual periphery, or the visual crowding effect.","""Aha""ptics: Enjoying an Aesthetic Aha During Haptic Exploration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567466,Perception,2019 02 15,"Perceptual insight, like recognizing hidden figures, increases the appreciation of visually perceived objects. We examined this Aesthetic Aha paradigm in the haptic domain. Participants were thinking aloud during haptic exploration of 11 visually nonaccessible panels. They explored them again evaluating them on liking, pleasingness, complexity, and interestingness. Afterwards they rated photographs of the panels on the same variables. Haptic pleasingness was predictable by the strength of insight (Aha!) during free exploration and the material feel. Liking was increased when complexity was high in addition. Pleasingness and interest were negatively related to each other but predicted liking in a combined model. Personality and explorative strategies were considered, for example, strength of insight was increased for ambiguity-tolerant people, and people with high need for closure explored more globally. Evaluations of haptic and visual explorations correlated significantly, and in both modalities, complexity correlated more strongly with interest than with liking. Our study transfers the Aesthetic Aha effect to the haptic domain and reveals slight differences in its hedonic quality with a potentially higher relevance of pleasingness. We suggest that revealing a (meaningful) structure during exploration-visually or haptically-can enhance positive affect and interest hereby benefits from an increased level of complexity.","Large-scale validation of miRNAs by disease association, evolutionary conservation and pathway activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567465,RNA biology,2019 04 11,"The validation of microRNAs (miRNAs) identified by next generation sequencing involves amplification-free and hybridization-based detection of transcripts as criteria for confirming valid miRNAs. Since respective validation is frequently not performed, miRNA repositories likely still contain a substantial fraction of false positive candidates while true miRNAs are not stored in the repositories yet. Especially if downstream analyses are performed with these candidates (e.g. target or pathway prediction), the results may be misleading. In the present study, we evaluated 558 mature miRNAs from miRBase and 1,709 miRNA candidates from next generation sequencing experiments by amplification-free hybridization and investigated their distributions in patients with various disease conditions. Notably, the most significant miRNAs in diseases are often not contained in the miRBase. However, these candidates are evolutionary highly conserved. From the expression patterns, target gene and pathway analyses and evolutionary conservation analyses, we were able to shed light on the complexity of miRNAs in humans. Our data also highlight that a more thorough validation of miRNAs identified by next generation sequencing is required. The results are available in miRCarta ( https://mircarta.cs.uni-saarland.de ).",Acinetobacter species in laboratory mice: species survey and antimicrobial resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567464,Laboratory animals,2018 12 20,"The extra-hospital epidemiology of Acinetobacter infections is a subject of debate. In recent years, the prevalence of animal multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections has increased considerably. The goal of the present study was to specify Acinetobacter species isolated from laboratory mice and to test them for their antimicrobial susceptibility. During routine microbiological monitoring of laboratory mice, 12 Acinetobacter spp. were isolated. By means of 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequencing, seven of the isolates were identified as Acinetobacter radioresistens, three isolates belonged to Acinetobacter genomospecies 14BJ, one isolate was classified as Acinetobacter pitii and one as Acinetobacter sp. ANC 4051. The distribution of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values was uniform for 21 of the 23 antimicrobial agents tested, whereas a broad MIC distribution was recorded for tulathromycin and streptomycin. The MIC values recorded were low for the majority of the antibiotics tested. Nevertheless, very high MIC values, which will probably render a therapeutic approach using these substances unsuccessful, were recorded for florfenicol, tiamulin, tilmicosin and cephalothin in most of the isolates. In conclusion, we document colonization of laboratory mice with different Acinetobacter species, displaying similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles, with possible implications in the Acinetobacter epidemiology as well as in the husbandry and experimentation of the colonized animals.",Molecular network of miR-1343 regulates the pluripotency of porcine pluripotent stem cells via repressing OTX2 expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567463,RNA biology,2019 04 11,"Porcine OTX2 was found to be highly activated in porcine iPS cells (piPSCs) that were reported by different laboratories worldwide. To reveal the regulatory function of OTX2 in porcine reprogrammed cells, we screened porcine miRNA-seq databases and found two miRNAs, miR-1343 and miR-545, that could specifically bind to 3'UTR of OTX2 and suppress endogenous OTX2 expression in piPSCs. Knockdown of OTX2 by miR-1343 and miR-545 could significantly increase the expression of SOX2 and ESRRB, but did not alter the expressions of OCT4 and KLF4, and improve the pluripotency of piPSCs. The promoter-based assays showed that OTX2 potentially bound to the promoter region of SOX2 and ESRRB and suppressed their expression. On the other hand, SOX2 could interact with OTX2 promoter. Ectopic expression of SOX2 could significantly decrease OTX2 promoter activity, showing that there is a negative feedback loop between SOX2 and OTX2. Additionally, SOX2 and ESRRB significantly stimulated miR-1343 expression in piPSCs, but OTX2 down regulated the expression of miR-1343 in either direct or indirect manners. In summary, this study demonstrates that there is a regulatory network mediated by miR-1343, in which downregulation of OTX2 by miR-1343 can elevate the expression of pluripotent genes that were then sustain the pluripotency of piPSCs.",A Proof-of-Concept Evaluation of JTPc and Tp-Tec as Proarrhythmia Biomarkers in Preclinical Species: A Retrospective Analysis by an HESI-Sponsored Consortium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567462,International journal of toxicology,2019 02 22,"Based on the ICH S7B and E14 guidance documents, QT interval (QTc) is used as the primary in vivo biomarker to assess the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP).

Once delivered to the ileum and colon, probiotics must adhere and form colonies on mucus that coats the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Although an increasing amount of knowledge about the genetic and molecular level mechanisms of probiotics-mucus interactions has been accumulated, little is known about the physicochemical aspects of probiotics-mucus interactions under physiological shear in intestines. In this study, we established well-defined models of intestinal epithelial cell monolayers based on two major constituents of gut epithelia, enterocytes and goblet cells. First, the formation of a polarized cell monolayer sealed by tight junctions was monitored by transepithelial electrical resistance over time. The establishment of tight junctions and secretion of mucus proteins (mucin) was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. In the next step, we measured the elasticity of cell monolayer surfaces by indentation using particle-assisted atomic force microscopy. The effective elastic modulus of goblet cell-like cells was 30 times smaller compared to that of enterocyte-like cells, which can be attributed to the secretion of a 3 μm thick mucin layer. As probiotics, we used Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), which is one of the most widely used strains as food additives. To investigate the dynamic adhesion of LGG to the intestine model surface, we transferred the epithelial cell monolayer into a microfluidic chamber. A distinct difference in dynamic adhesion between two cell types was observed, which could be attributed to the difference in the mucin expression amount. Remarkably, we found that the dynamic LGG adhesion is enhanced by the increase in shear stress, showing a maximum binding efficiency at 0.3 Pa. Finally, we examined the persistence of LGG adhesion by a stepwise increase in the shear stress exerted on adherent LGG, demonstrating that LGG could withstand high shear stress even beyond that of physiological stress. The obtained results present a large potential to quantitatively understand the influence of engineered foods and probiotics on the homeostasis of microbiota on the surface of intestinal epithelia.",Thymol Improves Barrier Function and Attenuates Inflammatory Responses in Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells during Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567427,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 06,"It is well-known that essential oil thymol exhibits antibacterial activity. The protective effects of thymol on pig intestine during inflammation is yet to be investigated. In this study, an in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model using IPEC-J2 cells was established. Cells were pretreated with thymol for 1 h and then exposed to LPS for various assays. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion, the mRNA abundance of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nutrient transporters, and tight junction proteins was measured. The results showed that LPS stimulation increased IL-8 secretion, ROS production, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA abundance ( P < 0.05), but the mRNA abundance of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAC1), and H+/peptide cotransporter 1 (PepT1) were decreased ( P < 0.05). Thymol blocked ROS production ( P < 0.05) and tended to decrease the production of LPS-induced IL-8 secretion ( P = 0.0766). The mRNA abundance of IL-8 and TNF-α was reduced by thymol pretreatment ( P < 0.05), but thymol did not improve the gene expression of nutrient transporters ( P > 0.05). The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was reduced and cell permeability increased by LPS treatment ( P < 0.05), but these effects were attenuated by thymol ( P < 0.05). Moreover, thymol increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and actin staining in the cells. However, the mRNA abundance of ZO-1 and occludin-3 was not affected by either LPS or thymol treatments. These results indicated that thymol enhances barrier function and reduce ROS production and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the epithelial cells during inflammation. The regulation of barrier function by thymol and LPS may be at post-transcriptional or post-translational levels.",Chimeric DNA-Functionalized Titanium Carbide MXenes for Simultaneous Mapping of Dual Cancer Biomarkers in Living Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567426,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 16,"Acquiring multilayer information on diverse biomarkers with different spatial distributions at the cellular level is crucial for monitoring the progression of cancers. Herein, a dual-signal-tagged chimeric DNA-functionalized titanium carbide MXenes nanoprobe (dcDNA-Ti3C2) that responds to biomarkers with different cellular locations from plasma membrane to cytoplasm was designed toward this end. In the presence of cancer biomarkers, including transmembrane glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1) and cytoplasmic microRNA-21 (miR-21), the recognition between MUC1 and its aptamer in the dcDNA-Ti3C2 probe induces the separation of TAMRA-MUC1 aptamer from Ti3C2 MXenes, thereby resulting in an increase in red fluorescence; and the hybridization of miR-21 with the hairpin probe triggers the increase of green fluorescence. As a result, dual analysis of MUC1 and miR-21 at low-nanomolar concentrations in vitro, as well as in situ simultaneous imaging of the biomarkers within MCF-7 breast cancer cells, was achieved. The feasibility of the nanoprobe was further demonstrated by monitoring the expression changes of both the biomarkers in cancer cells under different inhibitor combinations. Therefore, this strategy allows us to acquire the expression levels and spatial distributions of different biomarkers in living cells, providing a helpful tool for reliable diagnosis of cancers and basic understanding their progression.",Development of a Fluorescently Labeled Aptamer Structure-Switching Assay for Sensitive and Rapid Detection of Gliotoxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567425,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 16,"Gliotoxin, one of the most toxic metabolites produced during the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus, can cause direct damage to the immune system and results in infection and spread of Aspergillus, or even leads to invasive aspergillosis. Accurate, rapid, and sensitive detection of the disease-specific marker gliotoxin, particularly in serum, urine, or other body fluids, is therefore an important approach to achieving early and rapid diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillus Fumigatus Infection (IAFI). In this study, aptamers that specifically bind to gliotoxin were successfully obtained using immobilization-free GO-SELEX technology. Furthermore, the performance of the aptamer, including binding affinity, targeting specificity, and structural stability, was further improved by optimizing through truncation and mutation. Finally, the optimized aptamer APT8T1M was used to develop a novel fluorescently labeled aptamer structure-switching assay (FLASSA) for the detection of gliotoxin. The method exhibited a good linear range from 0.1 nM to 100 nM of gliotoxin, with a lower detection limit of 0.05 nM. Moreover, FLASSA was applied to the detection of gliotoxin in spiked serum and urine samples. A good mean recovery of 98.76-110.85% and a low coefficient of variation (5.45-14.59%) were obtained, indicating a high degree of selectivity for gliotoxin, good reproducibility, and stability. These results show that the developed FLASSA has significant potential and offers an alternative to the traditional analytical methods for the rapid, sensitive, and efficient detection of gliotoxin, thus, providing an effective tool for the early and rapid diagnosis of IAFI.",Perylene Derivative/Luminol Nanocomposite as a Strong Electrochemiluminescence Emitter for Construction of an Ultrasensitive MicroRNA Biosensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567424,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 16,"In this work, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) biosensor was constructed on the basis of amino-modified 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride/luminol (PTC-NH2/Lu) nanocomposite as emitter and bipedal DNA walker signal amplification strategy for ultrasensitive detection of microRNA-21 (miRNA-21). The PTC-NH2/Lu nanocomposite was prepared as signal tag via π-π stacking molecular assembly, in which amino-modified 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTC-NH2) as a novel coreaction accelerator significantly enhanced the ECL emission of luminol-H2O2 system. Moreover, target miRNA-21 triggered bipedal DNA walker was powered by toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction (TSDR) for signal amplification. Consequently, the proposed ECL biosensor achieved ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-21 with a linear range from 100 aM to 100 pM and a limit of detection of 33 aM. Simultaneously, the biosensor was also successfully applied to detect target miRNA-21 in lysates from human cancer cells. As a result, this work constructed a new signal amplification platform, exhibiting great application potential in biomedical analysis and early clinical diagnostics.","Influence of Diabetes Mellitus on Surgical Outcomes in Patients with Cervical Myelopathy: A Prospective, Multicenter Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567422,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,"Multicenter, prospective study.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Observations of the Conus Medullaris in a Korean Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567421,Asian spine journal,2019 04 21,Retrospective study (level of evidence: level 3).,Elevated Levels of Serum Pentosidine Are Associated with Dropped Head Syndrome in Older Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567420,Asian spine journal,2019 02 10,A retrospective observational study was performed.,Green Fabrication of Supported Platinum Nanoparticles by Supercritical CO₂ Deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567419,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"Pt nanoparticles were successfully deposited on uncatalyzed carbon paper by the supercritical CO₂ deposition (SCD) method using platinum (II) acetylacetonate as a precursor followed by thermal conversion.

The morphological structures and surface properties of the Pt/carbon paper composite were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyzer (EDS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The results of the 2⁴ factorial design showed that Pt loading on the substrate correlated significantly with deposition time, while Pt aggregation slightly increased with the thermal reduction temperature.

One of the most promising scaffolds is decellularized allogeneic extracellular matrix (ECM) then recellularized by autologous or stem cells, in order to develop fully personalized clinical approaches. Decellularization protocols have to efficiently remove immunogenic cellular materials, maintaining the nonimmunogenic ECM, which is endowed with specific inductive/differentiating actions due to its architecture and bioactive factors. In the present paper, we review the available literature about the development of grafts from decellularized human tissues/organs. Human tissues may be obtained not only from surgery but also from cadavers, suggesting possible development of Human Tissue BioBanks from body donation programs. Many human tissues/organs have been decellularized for tissue engineering purposes, such as cartilage, bone, skeletal muscle, tendons, adipose tissue, heart, vessels, lung, dental pulp, intestine, liver, pancreas, kidney, gonads, uterus, childbirth products, cornea, and peripheral nerves. In vitro recellularizations have been reported with various cell types and procedures (seeding, injection, and perfusion). Conversely, studies about in vivo behaviour are poorly represented.

We first derived the vertical deflection of the multilayered structure as a function of pressure and voltage using equilibrium equations of the structure. The deflection derived in this work is novel in that it includes the effect of piezoelectricity as well as the external pressure on the radiating surface. Subsequently, the circuit parameters were derived from the vertical deflection. The acoustic characteristics of the structure were then analyzed using the electro-acoustical model of an ultrasonic sensor for in-air application. Using the equivalent circuit, we analyzed the effects of various structural parameters on the acoustic properties of the structure such as resonance frequency, radiated sound pressure, and beam pattern. The validity of the ECM was verified initially by comparing the results with those from the finite element analysis (FEA) of the same structure. Furthermore, experimental testing of an actual ultrasonic sensor was carried out to verify the efficacy of the ECM.

The hardware validation is performed by electrochemical experiments such as Double Step Chronoamperometry (DSC), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV); moreover, a comparison of the experimental signals between a commercial potentiostat and the EPS was done by analysis of errors on the response signal. Results illustrate that the EPS is capable of handling currents in the range of absolute values of 86.44 to 3000 nA and having control voltages in the range of ±2 V. The device can support from 50 to 2000 samples per second. The EPS capabilities were compared with other compact potentiostats.

Adjusted Cox analysis showed an association between the highest tertile of HbA1C SD (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1) and a lower risk of the renal endpoint (hazard ratio = 0.175; 95% confidence interval = 0.059⁻0.518; p = 0.002) in the patients with an HbA1C level ≥ 7% and stages 3⁻4 CKD, but not in stage 5 CKD. Further subgroup analysis showed that the highest two tertiles of HbA1C SD were associated with a lower risk of the renal endpoint in the group with a decreasing trend of HbA1C. Our results demonstrated that greater HbA1C variability and a decreasing trend of HbA1C, which may be related to intensive diabetes control, was associated with a lower risk of progression to dialysis in the patients with stages 3⁻4 CKD and poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7%).",Blood-Based Biomarkers for Predicting the Risk for Five-Year Incident Coronary Heart Disease in the Framingham Heart Study via Machine Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567402,Genes,2019 01 10,"An improved approach for predicting the risk for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) could lead to substantial improvements in cardiovascular health. Previously, we have shown that genetic and epigenetic loci could predict CHD status more sensitively than conventional risk factors. Herein, we examine whether similar machine learning approaches could be used to develop a similar panel for predicting incident CHD. Training and test sets consisted of 1180 and 524 individuals, respectively. Data mining techniques were employed to mine for predictive biosignatures in the training set. An ensemble of Random Forest models consisting of four genetic and four epigenetic loci was trained on the training set and subsequently evaluated on the test set. The test sensitivity and specificity were 0.70 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, the Framingham risk score and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimator performed with test sensitivities of 0.20 and 0.38, respectively. Notably, the integrated genetic-epigenetic model predicted risk better for both genders and very well in the three-year risk prediction window. We describe a novel DNA-based precision medicine tool capable of capturing the complex genetic and environmental relationships that contribute to the risk of CHD, and being mapped to actionable risk factors that may be leveraged to guide risk modification efforts.",Liver Regeneration: Different Sub-Populations of Parenchymal Cells at Play Choreographed by an Injury-Specific Microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567401,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"Liver regeneration is crucial for the maintenance of liver functional mass during homeostasis and diseases. In a disease context-dependent manner, liver regeneration is contributed to by hepatocytes or progenitor cells. As long as they are replicatively competent, hepatocytes are the main cell type responsible for supporting liver size homeostasisand regeneration. The concept that all hepatocytes within the lobule have the same proliferative capacity but are differentially recruited according to the localization of the wound, or whether a yet to be defined sub-population of hepatocytes supports regeneration is still debated. In a chronically or severely injured liver, hepatocytes may enter a state of replicative senescence. In such conditions, small biliary cells activate and expand, a process called ductular reaction (DR). Work in the last few decades has demonstrated that DR cells can differentiate into hepatocytes and thereby contribute to parenchymal reconstitution. In this study we will review the molecular mechanisms supporting these two processes to determine potential targets that would be amenable for therapeutic manipulation to enhance liver regeneration.",IQOSTM vs. e-Cigarette vs. Tobacco Cigarette: A Direct Comparison of Short-Term Effects after Overnight-Abstinence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567400,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 02 28,"Introduction: Research from Philip Morris International's science division on its Heat-not-Burn product IQOSTM focused on its chemical, toxicological, clinical, and behavioral aspects. Independent research on the experiences and behavioral aspects of using IQOSTM, and how it compares to e-cigarettes, is largely lacking. The current randomized, cross-over behavioral trial tried to bridge the latter gaps. Methods: Participants (n = 30) came to the lab on three consecutive days after being overnight smoking abstinent. During each session, participants used one of three products (cigarette, e-cigarette, or IQOSTM) for five minutes. Exhaled CO (eCO) measurements and questionnaires were repeatedly administered throughout the session. Results: Smoking a cigarette for five minutes resulted in a significant increase of eCO, whereas using an IQOSTM resulted in a small but reliable increase (0.3 ppm). Vaping did not affect eCO. Cigarette craving reduced significantly after product use, with the decline being stronger for smoking than for e-cigarettes or IQOSTM. Withdrawal symptoms declined immediately after smoking or using IQOSTM, and with some delay after vaping. IQOSTM scored higher in terms of subjective reward/satisfaction and was slightly preferred to the e-cigarette. Discussion: Short-term use of IQOSTM has a minimal impact on eCO, is equally effective in reducing cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms as an e-cigarette, and is slightly preferred.",Effect of Capsaicin and Other Thermo-TRP Agonists on Thermoregulatory Processes in the American Cockroach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567399,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Capsaicin is known to activate heat receptor TRPV1 and induce changes in thermoregulatory processes of mammals. However, the mechanism by which capsaicin induces thermoregulatory responses in invertebrates is unknown. Insect thermoreceptors belong to the TRP receptors family, and are known to be activated not only by temperature, but also by other stimuli. In the following study, we evaluated the effects of different ligands that have been shown to activate (allyl isothiocyanate) or inhibit (camphor) heat receptors, as well as, activate (camphor) or inhibit (menthol and thymol) cold receptors in insects. Moreover, we decided to determine the effect of agonist (capsaicin) and antagonist (capsazepine) of mammalian heat receptor on the American cockroach's thermoregulatory processes. We observed that capsaicin induced the decrease of the head temperature of immobilized cockroaches. Moreover, the examined ligands induced preference for colder environments, when insects were allowed to choose the ambient temperature. Camphor exposure resulted in a preference for warm environments, but the changes in body temperature were not observed. The results suggest that capsaicin acts on the heat receptor in cockroaches and that TRP receptors are involved in cockroaches' thermosensation."

Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) display abnormal expression during activation of immune responses, and play a role in heterochromatic regulation of gene promoters. We have measured lncRNAs MEG3, PINT and GAS5, selected for their previously described association with heterochromatin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood samples collected from 86 participants with a diagnosis of psychosis and 44 control participants. Expression was assessed in relation to diagnosis, illness acuity status, and treatment with antipsychotic medication. We observed diagnostic differences with MEG3, PINT and GAS5, and symptom acuity effect with MEG3 and GAS5. Medication effects were evident in those currently on treatment with antipsychotics when compared to drug-naïve participants. We observed that clinical diagnosis and symptom acuity predict selected lncRNA expression. Particular noteworthy is the differential expression of MEG3 in drug naïve participants compared to those treated with risperidone. Additionally, an in vitro cell model using M2tol macrophages was used to test the effects of the antipsychotic drug risperidone on the expression of these lncRNAs using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Significant but differential effects of risperidone were observed in M2tol macrophages indicating a clear ability of antipsychotic medications to modify lncRNA expression.",Application of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks to Signals Collected from a Sensor Network for Autonomous Gas Source Localization in Outdoor Environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567386,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (CNN-LSTM) are a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that can extract spatial features in addition to classifying or making predictions from sequential data. In this paper, we analyzed the use of CNN-LSTM for gas source localization (GSL) in outdoor environments using time series data from a gas sensor network and anemometer. CNN-LSTM is used to estimate the location of a gas source despite the challenges created from inconsistent airflow and gas distribution in outdoor environments. To train CNN-LSTM for GSL, we used temporal data taken from a 5 × 6 metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensor array, spaced 1.5 m apart, and an anemometer placed in the center of the sensor array in an open area outdoors. The output of the CNN-LSTM is one of thirty cells approximating the location of a gas source. We show that by using CNN-LSTM, we were able to determine the location of a gas source from sequential data. In addition, we compared several artificial neural network (ANN) architectures as well as trained them without wind vector data to estimate the complexity of the task. We found that ANN is a promising prospect for GSL tasks.",Non-Coding RNAs to Aid in Neurological Prognosis after Cardiac Arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567385,Non-coding RNA,2019 01 13,"Cardiovascular disease in general, and sudden cardiac death in particular, have an enormous socio-economic burden worldwide. Despite significant efforts to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival rates remain low. Moreover, patients who survive to hospital discharge have a high risk of developing severe physical or neurological symptoms. Being able to predict outcomes after resuscitation from cardiac arrest would make it possible to tailor healthcare approaches, thereby maximising efforts for those who would mostly benefit from aggressive therapy. However, the identification of patients at risk of poor recovery after cardiac arrest is still a challenging task which could be facilitated by novel biomarkers. Recent investigations have recognised the potential of non-coding RNAs to aid in outcome prediction after cardiac arrest. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries and propose a handful of novel perspectives for the use of non-coding RNAs to predict outcome after cardiac arrest, discussing their use for precision medicine.",Formation of Nudicaulins In Vivo and In Vitro and the Biomimetic Synthesis and Bioactivity of O-Methylated Nudicaulin Derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567384,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Nudicaulins are yellow flower pigments accounting for the color of the petals of Papaver nudicaule (Papaveraceae). These glucosidic compounds belong to the small group of indole/flavonoid hybrid alkaloids. Here we describe in vivo and in vitro experiments which substantiate the strongly pH-dependent conversion of pelargonidin glucosides to nudicaulins as the final biosynthetic step of these alkaloids. Furthermore, we report the first synthesis of nudicaulin aglycon derivatives, starting with quercetin and ending up at the biomimetic fusion of a permethylated anthocyanidin with indole. A small library of nudicaulin derivatives with differently substituted indole units was prepared, and the antimicrobial, antiproliferative and cell toxicity data of the new compounds were determined. The synthetic procedure is considered suitable for preparing nudicaulin derivatives which are structurally modified in the indole and/or the polyphenolic part of the molecule and may have optimized pharmacological activities.",Manganese Phosphatizing Coatings: The Effects of Preparation Conditions on Surface Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567383,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"Manganese phosphate coating could be used to protect the surface of steel products. However, it is essential to determine the effects which process parameters, as well as the types of additives used, have on the efficiency of coating deposition. Thus, we present here a process of phosphatization of low-alloy steel (for 15 min at 95 °C) in manganese/nickel baths followed by a passivation process with the use of a silicon and zircon compounds. The microstructure and morphology of the surface were analyzed by SEM EDX and XRD methods. The obtained results showed that the manganese phosphate could be effectively formed at 95 °C in the solution containing nickel and guanidine derivatives. Anodic polarization of manganese coating was investigated in 0.5 M KCl by the analysis of polarization resistance. The effects of the activation process on corrosion properties of the coating have been examined. It was observed that an increased concentration of activating substances in the activation bath results in the enhancement of corrosion resistance.",A Novel Approach for Partial Discharge Measurements on GIS Using HFCT Sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567382,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"This paper presents a novel measuring system for partial discharge (PD) measurements in Gas Insulated Systems (GIS) using high frequency current transformers (HFCT). The system is based on the measurement of the induced PD currents in the GIS enclosure. In opposition to the existing antenna technologies that measure the radiated energy in the very high frequency/ultra-high frequency (VHF/UHF) range, the proposed system measures the PD conducted currents in the high frequency (HF) range and below. The foundation of the measurements together with a detailed explanation of the sensor installed conveniently at the bolts of the GIS spacer are presented. An experimental study on the current distribution in the GIS enclosure is described to evaluate the impact of the sensor on the measurements. Laboratory experiments have been performed that show the suitability of this method to properly measure particle discharges caused by corona, surface and free moving particle discharges in SF₆. Discharges in the range of 1 to 4 pC have been properly measured. An analysis to evaluate the performance of the method is shown, in comparison to VHF/UHF antenna measurements. The potential benefits of this novel technique rely on the small attenuation of PD signals in the GIS components in the HF range and sample rate reductions. Finally, a discussion on the potential applicability of present cluster and charge calculation techniques to the proposed PD GIS measurement using HFCT is presented.",Synthesis and Evaluation of the 4-Substituted 2-Hydroxy-5-Iodochalcones and Their 7-Substituted 6-Iodoflavonol Derivatives for Inhibitory Effect on Cholinesterases and β-Secretase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567381,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"A series of 2-aryl-3-hydroxy-6-iodo-4H-chromen-4-ones substituted at the 7-position with a halogen atom (X = F, Cl and Br) or methoxy group and their corresponding 4-substituted 2-hydroxy-5-iodochalcone precursors were evaluated in vitro for inhibitory effect against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and β-secretase (BACE1) activities. Although moderate inhibitory effect was observed for the chalcones against AChE, derivatives 2h, 2j and 2n exhibited significant inhibitory effect against BChE and BACE-1. The 2-aryl-7-fluoro-8-iodoflavonols 3b and 3c, on the other hand, exhibited increased activity and selectivity against AChE and reduced effect on BACE-1. The flavonols 3h, 3i, 3k, 3l and 3p exhibited moderate inhibitory effect against AChE, but significant inhibition against BChE. Compounds 2j and 3l exhibited non-competitive mode of inhibition against BACE-1. Molecular docking predicted strong interactions with the protein residues in the active site of BACE-1 implying these compounds bind with the substrate. Similarly docking studies predicted interaction of the most active compounds with both CAS and PAS of either AChE or BChE with mixed type of enzyme inhibition confirmed by kinetic studies.",Adrenergic Regulation of Drp1-Driven Mitochondrial Fission in Cardiac Physio-Pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567380,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Abnormal mitochondrial morphology, especially fragmented mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction are hallmarks of a variety of human diseases including heart failure (HF). Although emerging evidence suggests a link between mitochondrial fragmentation and cardiac dysfunction, it is still not well described which cardiac signaling pathway regulates mitochondrial morphology and function under pathophysiological conditions such as HF. Mitochondria change their shape and location via the activity of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins. This mechanism is suggested as an important modulator for mitochondrial and cellular functions including bioenergetics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca2+ signaling, cell growth, and death in the mammalian cell- and tissue-specific manners. Recent reports show that a mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-like/related protein 1 (DLP1/Drp1), is post-translationally modified via cell signaling pathways, which control its subcellular localization, stability, and activity in cardiomyocytes/heart. In this review, we summarize the possible molecular mechanisms for causing post-translational modifications (PTMs) of DLP1/Drp1 in cardiomyocytes, and further discuss how these PTMs of DLP1/Drp1 mediate abnormal mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial dysfunction under adrenergic signaling activation that contributes to the development and progression of HF.","Design, Implementation and Validation of a GNSS Measurement Exclusion and Weighting Function with a Dual Polarized Antenna.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567379,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) have become a ubiquitous tool for our modern society to carry out vital tasks such as transportation, civil engineering or precision agriculture. This breath has reached the realm of safety-critical applications such as time management of critical infrastructures or autonomous vehicles, in which GNSS is an essential tool nowadays. Unfortunately, current GNSS performance is not enough to fulfill the requirements of these professional and critical applications. For this reason, the FANTASTIC project was launched to boost the adoption of these applications. The project was funded by the European GNSS agency (GSA) in order to enhance the robustness and accuracy of GNSS in harsh environments. This paper presents the part related to the development of a weighting and exclusion function with a dual circularly polarized antenna. The idea is to reduce the effects of multipath by weighting and/or excluding those measurements affected by multipath. The observables and other metrics obtained from a dual polarized antenna will be exploited to define an exclusion threshold and to provide the weights. Real-world experiments will show the improvement in the positioning solution, using all available constellations, obtained with the developed technique.",Dynamics of Axl Receptor Shedding in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Its Implication for Theranostics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567378,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"Signaling of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl and its ligand Gas6 is crucially involved in the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by activation of hepatic stellate cells and modulation of hepatocyte differentiation. Shedding of Axl's ectodomain leads to the release of soluble Axl (sAxl), which is increased in advanced fibrosis and in early-to-late stage HCC in the presence and absence of cirrhosis. Here, we focus on the dynamics of Axl receptor shedding and delineate possible scenarios how Axl signaling might act as driver of fibrosis progression and HCC development. Based on experimental and clinical data, we discuss the consequences of modifying Axl signaling by sAxl cleavage, as well as cellular strategies to escape from antagonizing effects of Axl shedding by the involvement of the hepatic microenvironment. We emphasize a correlation between free Gas6 and free sAxl levels favoring abundant Gas6/Axl signaling in advanced fibrosis and HCC. The raised scenario provides a solid basis for theranostics allowing the use of sAxl as an accurate diagnostic biomarker of liver cirrhosis and HCC, as well as Axl receptor signaling for therapeutic intervention in stratified HCC patients."

To this aim, chromatographic conditions were optimized so as to achieve the separation of major phenolic compounds already identified in paprika. Paprika samples were subjected to a sample extraction stage by sonication and centrifugation; extracting procedure and conditions were optimized to maximize the generation of enough discriminant fingerprints. Finally, chromatograms were baseline corrected, compressed employing fast Fourier transform (FFT), and then analyzed by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and LDA to carry out the classification of paprika samples.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RES) on the body weight and browning of white fat in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and the potential associated mechanism in vivo. Eight-week-old male mice were randomized to receive different treatments: (1), chow without any additional treatment (chow); (2), chow plus 0.4% resveratrol (chow-RES); (3), HFD without any additional treatment (HFD); and (4), HFD plus 0.4% resveratrol (HFD-RES). After 4 weeks of feeding, additional 8-week-old male recipient mice were randomly allocated to the following 4 treatments: (5), HFD and received feces from chow-fed mice; (6), HFD and received feces from chow-RES-fed mice; (7), HFD and received feces from HFD-fed mice; and (8), HFD and received feces from HFD-RES-fed mice. RES treatment significantly inhibited increases in fat accumulation, promoted the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice. Subsequent analyses showed that the gut microbiota remodeling induced by resveratrol had a positive role in WAT browning, and sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) signaling appears to be a key component of this process. Overall, the results show that RES may serve as a potential intervention to reduce obesity by alleviating dysbiosis of the gut microbiota.",Tilted Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor Using Chemical Plating of a Palladium Membrane for the Detection of Hydrogen Leakage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567365,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"A tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) hydrogen sensor coated with a palladium (Pd) membrane by the electroless plating method is proposed in this paper. A uniform layer of Pd metal is fabricated in aqueous solutions by the chemical coating method, which is used as the sensitive element to detect the change of the surrounding refractive index (SRI) caused by hydrogen absorption. The change in SRI causes an unsynchronized change of the cladding modes and the Bragg peak in the TFBG transmission spectrum, thereby eliminating the cross-sensitivity due to membrane expansion and is able to simultaneously monitor the presence of cracks in the pipe, as well as the hydrogen leakage. By subtracting the wavelength shift caused by fiber expansion, the change of SRI, i.e., the information from the H₂ level, can be separately obtained. The drifted wavelength is measured for the H₂ concentration below the hydrogen explosion limit between 1% and 4%. The chemical-based coating has the advantages of a low cost, a simple operation, and being suitable for coating on long fiber structures. The proposed sensor is able to detect the H₂ signal in 5 min at a 1% H₂ concentration. The proposed sensor is proved to be able to monitor the hydrogen level without the cross-sensitivity of temperature variation and expansion strains, so could be a good candidate for security applications in industry.",Investigation of the Compressibility and Compactibility of Titanate Nanotube-API Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567364,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"The present work aims to reveal the pharma-industrial benefits of the use of hydrothermally synthesised titanate nanotube (TNT) carriers in the manufacturing of nano-sized active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Based on this purpose, the compressibility and compactibility of various APIs (diltiazem hydrochloride, diclofenac sodium, atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide) and their 1:1 composites formed with TNTs were investigated in a comparative study, using a Lloyd 6000R uniaxial press instrumented with a force gauge and a linear variable differential transformer extensometer. The tablet compression was performed without the use of any excipients, thus providing the precise energetic characterisation of the materials' behaviour under pressure. In addition to the powder functionality test, the post-compressional properties of the tablets were also determined and evaluated. The results of the energetic analysis demonstrated that the use of TNTs as drug carriers is beneficial in every step of the tabletting process: besides providing better flowability and more favourable particle rearrangement, it highly decreases the elastic recovery of the APIs and results in ideal plastic deformation. Moreover, the post-compressional properties of the TNT⁻API composites were found to be exceptional (e.g., great tablet hardness and tensile strength), affirming the above results and proving the potential in the use of TNT carriers for drug manufacturing.",A Microfluidic Spheroid Culture Device with a Concentration Gradient Generator for High-Throughput Screening of Drug Efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567363,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is considered more clinically relevant in mimicking the structural and physiological conditions of tumors in vivo compared to two-dimensional cell cultures. In recent years, high-throughput screening (HTS) in 3D cell arrays has been extensively used for drug discovery because of its usability and applicability. Herein, we developed a microfluidic spheroid culture device (μFSCD) with a concentration gradient generator (CGG) that enabled cells to form spheroids and grow in the presence of cancer drug gradients. The device is composed of concave microwells with several serpentine micro-channels which generate a concentration gradient. Once the colon cancer cells (HCT116) formed a single spheroid (approximately 120 μm in diameter) in each microwell, spheroids were perfused in the presence of the cancer drug gradient irinotecan for three days. The number of spheroids, roundness, and cell viability, were inversely proportional to the drug concentration. These results suggest that the μFSCD with a CGG has the potential to become an HTS platform for screening the efficacy of cancer drugs.",Food Volume Estimation Based on Deep Learning View Synthesis from a Single Depth Map.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567362,Nutrients,2019 02 15,"An objective dietary assessment system can help users to understand their dietary behavior and enable targeted interventions to address underlying health problems. To accurately quantify dietary intake, measurement of the portion size or food volume is required. For volume estimation, previous research studies mostly focused on using model-based or stereo-based approaches which rely on manual intervention or require users to capture multiple frames from different viewing angles which can be tedious. In this paper, a view synthesis approach based on deep learning is proposed to reconstruct 3D point clouds of food items and estimate the volume from a single depth image. A distinct neural network is designed to use a depth image from one viewing angle to predict another depth image captured from the corresponding opposite viewing angle. The whole 3D point cloud map is then reconstructed by fusing the initial data points with the synthesized points of the object items through the proposed point cloud completion and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms. Furthermore, a database with depth images of food object items captured from different viewing angles is constructed with image rendering and used to validate the proposed neural network. The methodology is then evaluated by comparing the volume estimated by the synthesized 3D point cloud with the ground truth volume of the object items.",The Importance of Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Nadir after Primary Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Hormone-Naïve Prostate Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567361,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 01 08,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is currently the most useful biomarker for detection of prostate cancer (PCa). The ability to measure serum PSA levels has affected all aspects of PCa management over the past two decades. The standard initial systemic therapy for advanced PCa is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Although PCa patients with metastatic disease initially respond well to ADT, they often progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has a high mortality rate. We have demonstrated that time to PSA nadir (TTN) after primary ADT is an important early predictor of overall survival and progression-free survival for advanced PCa patients. In in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that the presence of fibroblasts in the PCa tumor microenvironment can prolong the period for serum PSA decline after ADT, and enhance the efficacy of ADT. Clarification of the mechanisms that affect TTN after ADT could be useful to guide selection of optimal PCa treatment strategies. In this review, we discuss recent in vitro and in vivo findings concerning the involvement of stromal⁻epithelial interactions in the biological mechanism of TTN after ADT to support the novel concept of ""tumor regulating fibroblasts"".","Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor, a Novel Receptor for Vegetative Insecticidal Protein Vip3Aa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567360,Toxins,2019 06 13,"Vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vips), which are secreted by some Bacillus thuringiensis strains during vegetative growth, exhibit high virulence to many pests. Vip3A proteins have been used commercially both in some bio-insecticides and in transgenic crops; however, compared with insecticidal crystal proteins, the mechanism of action of Vip3A is still unclear. In this work, we indicated that the fibroblast growth factor receptor-like protein (Sf-FGFR) from the membrane of Sf9 cells could bind to Vip3Aa. The interaction between Vip3Aa and Sf-FGFR was confirmed by pull-down assays and dot blotting experiment in vitro. The binding affinity between Vip3Aa and extracellular regions of Sf-FGFR (GST-FGFR-N) was determined by microscale thermophoresis assay (MST). Moreover, Vip3Aa-Flag could be co-immunoprecipitated with Sf-FGFR-V5 ex vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of Sf-FGFR gene in Sf9 cells resulted in reducing the mortality of those cells to Vip3Aa. In summary, our data indicated that Sf-FGFR is a novel receptor for Vip3Aa.",Development of Microfluidic Stretch System for Studying Recovery of Damaged Skeletal Muscle Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567359,Micromachines,2019 01 11,"The skeletal muscle occupies about 40% mass of the human body and plays a significant role in the skeletal movement control. Skeletal muscle injury also occurs often and causes pain, discomfort, and functional impairment in daily living. Clinically, most studies observed the recovery phenomenon of muscle by massage or electrical stimulation, but there are limitations on quantitatively analyzing the effects on recovery. Although additional efforts have been made within in vitro biochemical research, some questions still remain for effects of the different cell microenvironment for recovery. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a microfluidic system to investigate appropriate conditions for repairing skeletal muscle injury. First, the muscle cells were cultured in the microfluidic chip and differentiated to muscle fibers. After differentiation, we treated hydrogen peroxide and 18% axial stretch to cause chemical and physical damage to the muscle fibers. Then the damaged muscle fibers were placed under the cyclic stretch condition to allow recovery. Finally, we analyzed the damage and recovery by quantifying morphological change as well as the intensity change of intracellular fluorescent signals and showed the skeletal muscle fibers recovered better in the cyclic stretched condition. In total, our in situ generation of muscle damage and induction recovery platform may be a key system for investigating muscle recovery and rehabilitation.",Effects of Space Flight on Mouse Liver versus Kidney: Gene Pathway Analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567358,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase."

Drowsiness level can be readily detected through measurement of human brain activity. The electroencephalogram (EEG), a device whose application relies on adhering electrodes to the scalp, is the primary method used to monitor brain activity. The many electrodes and wires required to perform an EEG place considerable constraints on the movement of users, and the cost of the device limits its availability. For these reasons, conventional EEG devices are not used in practical studies and businesses. Many potential practical applications could benefit from the development of a wire-free, low-priced device; however, it remains to be elucidated whether portable EEG devices can be used to estimate human drowsiness levels and applied within practical research settings and businesses. In this study, we outline the development of a drowsiness detection system that makes use of a low-priced, prefrontal single-channel EEG device and evaluate its performance in an offline analysis and a practical experiment. Firstly, for the development of the system, we compared three feature extraction methods: power spectral density (PSD), autoregressive (AR) modeling, and multiscale entropy (MSE) for detecting characteristics of an EEG. In order to efficiently select a meaningful PSD, we utilized step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA). Time-averaging and robust-scaling were used to fit the data for pattern recognition. Pattern recognition was performed by a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The optimal hyperparameters for the SVM were selected by the grind search method so as to increase drowsiness detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of the detections, we calculated classification accuracy using the SVM through 10-fold cross-validation. Our model achieved a classification accuracy of 72.7% using the PSD with SWLDA and the SVM. Secondly, we conducted a practical study using the system and evaluated its performance in a practical situation. There was a significant difference (* p < 0.05) between the drowsiness-evoked task and concentration-needed task. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our low-priced portable drowsiness detection system in quantifying drowsy states. We anticipate that our system will be useful to practical studies with aims as diverse as measurement of classroom mental engagement, evaluation of movies, and office environment evaluation.",Pathological Process of Prompt Connection between Host and Donor Tissue Vasculature Causing Rapid Perfusion of the Engineered Donor Tissue after Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567345,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"The shortage of donors for transplantation therapy is a serious issue worldwide. Tissue engineering is considered a potential solution to this problem. Connection and perfusion in engineered tissues after transplantation is vital for the survival of the transplanted tissue, especially for tissues requiring blood perfusion to receive nutrients, such as the heart. A myocardial cell sheet containing an endothelial cell network structure was fabricated in vitro using cell sheet technology. Transplantation of the three-dimensional (3D) tissue by layering myocardial sheets could ameliorate ischemic heart disease in a rat model. The endothelial cell network in the 3D tissue was able to rapidly connect to host vasculature and begin perfusion within 24 h after transplantation. In this review, we compare and discuss the engineered tissue⁻host vasculature connection process between tissue engineered constructs with hydrogels and cell sheets by histological analysis. This review provides information that may be useful for further improvements of in vivo engineered tissue vascularization techniques.",Anthropomorphic Breast and Head Phantoms for Microwave Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567344,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 13,"This paper deals with breast and head phantoms fabricated from 3D-printed structures and liquid mixtures whose complex permittivities are close to that of the biological tissues within a large frequency band. The goal is to enable an easy and safe manufacturing of stable-in-time detailed anthropomorphic phantoms dedicated to the test of microwave imaging systems to assess the performances of the latter in realistic configurations before a possible clinical application to breast cancer imaging or brain stroke monitoring. The structure of the breast phantom has already been used by several laboratories to test their measurement systems in the framework of the COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action TD1301-MiMed. As for the tissue mimicking liquid mixtures, they are based upon Triton X-100 and salted water. It has been proven that such mixtures can dielectrically mimic the various breast tissues. It is shown herein that they can also accurately mimic most of the head tissues and that, given a binary fluid mixture model, the respective concentrations of the various constituents needed to mimic a particular tissue can be predetermined by means of a standard minimization method.",Underwater Optical Imaging for Automotive Wading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567343,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"An underwater imaging system was investigated for automotive use in highly scattered underwater environments. The purpose of the system is the driver's information about hidden obstacles, such as stones, driftwood, open sewer hatches. A comparison of various underwater vision methods was presented by the way they are implemented, the range reached, and the cost of implementation. It has been experimentally shown that a conventional active system can provide a maximum visibility range of up to three light attenuation lengths. In most practical cases of turbid waters during floods, this corresponds to distances of about 1 meter. From the presented analysis it follows that advanced extended range imaging methods allow increasing of the visibility range up to 2 meters.",Inverse Molecular Docking as a Novel Approach to Study Anticarcinogenic and Anti-Neuroinflammatory Effects of Curcumin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567342,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Research efforts are placing an ever increasing emphasis on identifying signal transduction pathways related to the chemopreventive activity of curcumin. Its anticarcinogenic effects are presumably mediated by the regulation of signaling cascades, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). By modulating signal transduction pathways, curcumin induces apoptosis in malignant cells, thus inhibiting cancer development and progression. Due to the lack of mechanistic insight in the scientific literature, we developed a novel inverse molecular docking protocol based on the CANDOCK algorithm. For the first time, we performed inverse molecular docking of curcumin into a collection of 13,553 available human protein structures from the Protein Data Bank resulting in prioritized target proteins of curcumin. Our predictions were in agreement with the scientific literature and confirmed that curcumin binds to folate receptor β, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A, metalloproteinase-2, mitogen-activated protein kinase 9, epidermal growth factor receptor and apoptosis-inducing factor 1. We also identified new potential protein targets of curcumin, namely deoxycytidine kinase, NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 and -2, ecto-5'-nucleotidase, core histone macro-H2A.1, tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, GTPase HRas, aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase member 3, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3, amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase, death-associated protein kinase 2 and tryptophan-tRNA ligase, that may all play a crucial role in its observed anticancer effects. Moreover, our inverse docking results showed that curcumin potentially binds also to the proteins cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D and 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10, which provides a new explanation for its efficiency in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We firmly believe that our computational results will complement and direct future experimental studies on curcumin's anticancer activity as well as on its therapeutic effects against Alzheimer's disease.",Fermentability of a Novel Galacto-Oligosaccharide Mixture by Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567341,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"This study aimed to investigate the specific growth stimulation of certain desired intestinal bacteria by a novel galacto-oligosaccharide mixture, which was produced with a β-galactosidase from a potential probiotic Lactobacillus isolate that contained mainly oligosaccharides of β-1,3 and β-1,6 glycosidic linkages (termed Lb-GOS) using single-strain fermentations. The composition of this Lb-GOS mixture was 33.5% disaccharides, 60.5% trisaccharides, 4.8% tetrasaccharides, and 1.0% pentasaccharides with a negligible amount of monosaccharides, lactose, and lactobionic acid (0.3%). Eight Lactobacillus spp. strains and three Bifidobacterium spp. strains were used in single-strain fermentations to determine the fermentation activity scores of this Lb-GOS preparation compared to two commercially available prebiotic mixtures, 4'GOS-P and Vivinal GOS (V-GOS). The highest scores were obtained when L. reuteri Lb46 and the two Bifidobacterium strains, B. animalis subsp. lactis Bif1 and Bif3, were grown on these galacto-oligosaccharide mixtures. In addition, the Lb-GOS mixture was found to have higher fermentation activity scores; hence, it stimulated the growth of these probiotic strains more than 4'GOS-P and V-GOS, which may be attributed to the different glycosidic linkage types that are found in the Lb-GOS mixture compared to the other two commercial preparations. These findings suggested that the Lb-GOS mixture that is described in this work should be of interest for the formulations of new carbohydrate-based functional food ingredients.",Natural Dyes and Their Derivatives Integrated into Organic Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567340,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"Natural photosynthetic systems contain several dyes such as carotenoids or chlorophylls which are adequately arranged to produce efficient photoinduced charge separation and electron transfer. Several research groups have attempted integrating these natural dyes and photosynthetic systems into functional organic solar cells (OSCs) producing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 0.99%. The studies presented in this short review emphasize that functionalization of natural dyes can considerably improve their PCEs. For instance, chlorophyll derivatives can yield PCEs up to 2.1%, and copolymers produced with isoindigo as an electron-deficient unit generate high PCEs up to 8%, respectively, when combined with fullerene C70 based electron acceptors in the OSC active layers. An alternative approach for natural dye integration into OSC architectures is to place these light-harvesting antennas at the interface between the active layer and the charge collection layers in these low-cost photovoltaic devices. This strategy produces large PCE increases up to 35% with respect to OSCs prepared without the interlayer. When light-harvesting systems are combined with silver nanoprisms as interlayers, additional localized surface plasmon resonance effects result in high-performance OSCs that integrate natural photosynthetic systems and demonstrate a PCE over the milestone value of 10%.",Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Analysis for Elucidating the Mechanism of Photosystem II Acclimation to Cadmium Exposure in the Hyperaccumulating Plant Noccaea caerulescens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567339,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"We provide new data on the mechanism of Noccaea caerulescens acclimation to Cd exposure by elucidating the process of photosystem II (PSII) acclimation by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging analysis. Seeds from the metallophyte N. caerulescens were grown in hydroponic culture for 12 weeks before exposure to 40 and 120 μM Cd for 3 and 4 days. At the beginning of exposure to 40 μM Cd, we observed a spatial leaf heterogeneity of decreased PSII photochemistry, that later recovered completely. This acclimation was achieved possibly through the reduced plastoquinone (PQ) pool signaling. Exposure to 120 μM Cd under the growth light did not affect PSII photochemistry, while under high light due to a photoprotective mechanism (regulated heat dissipation for protection) that down-regulated PSII quantum yield, the quantum yield of non-regulated energy loss in PSII (Φ
NO
) decreased even more than control values. Thus, N. caerulescens plants exposed to 120 μM Cd for 4 days exhibited lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as singlet oxygen (¹O₂). The response of N. caerulescens to Cd exposure fits the 'Threshold for Tolerance Model', with a lag time of 4 d and a threshold concentration of 40 μM Cd required for the induction of the acclimation mechanism.",Gleeble-Simulated and Semi-Industrial Studies on the Microstructure Evolution of Fe-Co-Cr-Mo-W-V-C Alloy during Hot Deformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567337,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"Fe-Co-Cr-Mo-W-V-C alloy is one of the most important materials for manufacturing drills, dies, and other cutting tools owing to its excellent hardness. However, it is prone to cracking due to its poor hot ductility during continuous hot working processes. In this investigation, the microstructure characteristics and carbide transformations of the alloy in as-cast and wrought states are studied, respectively. Microstructural observation and first-principles calculation were conducted on the research of types and mechanical properties of carbides. The results reveal that carbides in as-cast Fe-Co-Cr-Mo-W-V-C alloy are mainly Mo₂C, VC, and Cr-rich carbides (Cr₇C₃ and Cr23C₆). The carbides in wrought Fe-Co-Cr-Mo-W-V-C alloy consist of Fe₂Mo₄C, VC, Cr₇C₃, and a small amount of retained Mo₂C. For these carbides, Cr₇C₃ presents the maximum bulk modulus and B/G values of 316.6 GPa and 2.48, indicating Cr₇C₃ has the strongest ability to resist the external force and crack initiation. VC presents the maximum shear modulus and Yong's modulus values of 187.3 GPa and 465.3 GPa, which means VC can be considered as a potential hard material. Hot isothermal compression tests were performed using a Gleeble-3500 device to simulate the flow behavior of the alloy during hot deformation. As-cast specimens were uniaxially compressed to a 70% height reduction over the temperature range of 1323⁻1423 K and strain rates of 0.05⁻1 s-1. A constitutive equation was established to characterize the relationship of peak true stress, strain rate, and deformation temperature of the alloy. The calculated results were in a good agreement with the experimental data. In order to study the texture evolution, the microstructures of the deformed specimens were observed, and an optimal deformation temperature was selected. Using the laboratorial optimal temperature (1373 K) in forging of an industrial billet resulted in uniform grains, with the largest size of 17 µm, surrounded by homogenous spherical carbides.",Mechanical Behavior of Natural Fiber-Based Bi-Directional Corrugated Lattice Sandwich Structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567336,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"In this study, 11 kinds of composite material were prepared, and the compression behavior of a bi-directional corrugated lattice sandwich structure prepared using jute fiber and epoxy resin was explored. The factors affecting the mechanical behavior of single and double-layer structures were studied separately. The results shows that the fiber angle, length-to-diameter ratio of the struts, and the type of fiber cloth have the most significant influence on the mechanical behavior of the single-layer lattice structure when preparing the core layer. When the fiber angle of the core layer jute/epoxy prepreg is (90/90) the compressive strength and Young's modulus are 83.3% and 60.0% higher than the fiber angle of (45/45). The configuration of the core and the presence of the intermediate support plate of the double-layer structure have a large influence on the compression performance of the two-layer structure. After the configuration was optimized, the compressive strength and Young's modulus were increased by 40.0% and 28.9%, respectively. The presence of the intermediate support plate increases the compressive strength, and Young's modulus of the double-layer structure by 75.0% and 26.6%, respectively. The experimental failure is dominated by the buckling, fracture, and delamination of the core struts."

Cyclodextrins can be added to amphotericin formulations to enhance both their solubility and antifungal properties. Semisolid amphotericin formulations containing gamma cyclodextrin (AGCD) were prepared and compared with two reference formulations-one of them without any solubility enhancer (A) and the other with DMSO (ADMSO). Rheological, the permeability through hairless mouse skin and antifungal characteristics of the different formulations were evaluated. All three semisolid formulations show low thixotropy characteristics. ADMSO was the formulation with the least consistency, lowest viscosity, and greatest extensibility. The AGCD formulation had the opposite behavior and had both the greatest consistency and viscosity and the lowest extensibility. The lowest permeability was obtained with the reference A formulation while both AGCD and ADMSO had a similar permeability enhancement. According to the antimicrobial in vitro efficacy trials, the AGCD formulation showed 45⁻60% more activity than the reference A formulation. It can be concluded that γ-cyclodextrin is a useful excipient to improve the solubility, permeability, and antifungal activity of amphotericin B in semisolid topical formulations.",Biosynthesis of Metal Nanoparticles via Microbial Enzymes: A Mechanistic Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567324,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"During the last decade, metal nanoparticles (MtNPs) have gained immense popularity due to their characteristic physicochemical properties, as well as containing antimicrobial, anti-cancer, catalyzing, optical, electronic and magnetic properties. Primarily, these MtNPs have been synthesized through different physical and chemical methods. However, these conventional methods have various drawbacks, such as high energy consumption, high cost and the involvement of toxic chemical substances. Microbial flora has provided an alternative platform for the biological synthesis of MtNPs in an eco-friendly and cost effective way. In this article we have focused on various microorganisms used for the synthesis of different MtNPs. We also have elaborated on the intracellular and extracellular mechanisms of MtNP synthesis in microorganisms, and have highlighted their advantages along with their challenges. Moreover, due to several advantages over chemically synthesized nanoparticles, the microbial MtNPs, with their exclusive and dynamic characteristics, can be used in different sectors like the agriculture, medicine, cosmetics and biotechnology industries in the near future.","Analysis of Anxiety, Depression and Aggression in Patients Attending Pain Clinics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567323,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 02 28,"The aim of the study was to measure the frequency of such emotional disturbances as anxiety, depression and aggression among patients treated in a pain clinic, as well as assess the factors contributing to such disorders. Research was conducted from January 2014 to April 2018 and involved patients treated in two pain clinics in the city of Warsaw, Poland. The study used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Modified Version (HADS-M) and the Numerical Rating Scale (NSR). 1025 patients were recruited. The main reasons for their attending the pain clinic were osteoarticular pain (43.61%) and neuropathic pain (41.56%). Emotional disturbances in the form of anxiety were diagnosed in 32.39% of all the patients, depression in 17.85%, and aggression in 46.15%. The factors determining the level of anxiety in the study group were: sex, age, pain intensity and the lack of pharmacological treatment.

They can cause cancer, reproductive and developmental issues, damage to the immune system, and can deeply interfere with the endocrine system. Dioxins toxicity is mediated by the Aryl-hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) which mediates the cellular metabolic adaptation to these planar aromatic xenobiotics through the classical transcriptional regulation pathway, including AhR binding of ligand in the cytosol, translocation of the receptor to the nucleus, dimerization with the AhR nuclear translocator, and the binding of this heterodimeric transcription factor to dioxin-responsive elements which regulate the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. 2,3,7,8-TCDD is the most toxic among dioxins showing the highest affinity toward the AhR receptor. Beside this classical and well-studied pathway, a number of papers are dealing with the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the response to environmental xenobiotics. In this review, we report on the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in dioxins-induced cellular response by inspecting recent literature and focusing our attention on epigenetic mechanisms induced by the most toxic 2,3,7,8-TCDD.","Suppressing Effect of 2-Nitrobenzaldehyde on Singlet Oxygen Generation, Fatty Acid Photooxidation, and Dye-Sensitizer Degradation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567321,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 11,"2-Nitrobenzaldehyde was found to efficiently block singlet oxygen generation in a series of different test samples upon exposure to UV and visible light under aerobic conditions. The effect of quenching singlet oxygen formation was monitored in the presence of 1, 4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABCO) acting as a well-known singlet oxygen scavenger. A comparison of different nitrobenzaldehyde isomers with other highly effective synthetic antioxidants used in the food industry such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) revealed that the protection of materials from singlet oxygen decreases in the order of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde > DABCO > TBHQ > 3-nitrobenzaldehyde > BHA > 4-nitrobenzaldehyde > BHT. Upon addition of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, the oxidation of fatty acids and the degradation of photosensitizers was found to be considerably diminished, which indicates that the presence of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde has a significant protective influence by restricting the singlet oxygen generation and photodegradation of dyes. Moreover, the compound turned out to display its highly suppressing effects on typical singlet oxygen-dependent reactions, such as fatty acid photooxidation and dye photosensitizer degradation, in a rather broad spectral region covering wavelengths from 300 nm (UV-B) to 575 nm (close to the maximum of ambient solar radiation).",Transcriptomic Characterization of the South American Freshwater Stingray Potamotrygon motoro Venom Apparatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567320,Toxins,2019 06 13,"Venomous animals are found through a wide taxonomic range including cartilaginous fish such as the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro occurring in South America, which can injure people and cause venom-related symptoms. Ensuring the efficacy of drug development to treat stingray injuries can be assisted by the knowledge of the venom composition. Here we performed a detailed transcriptomic characterization of the venom gland of the South American freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro. The transcripts retrieved showed 418 hits to venom components (comparably to 426 and 396 hits in other two Potamotrygon species), with high expression levels of hyaluronidase, cystatin and calglandulin along with hits uniquely found in P. motoro such as DELTA-alicitoxin-Pse1b, Augerpeptide hhe53 and PI-actitoxin-Aeq3a. We also identified undescribed molecules with extremely high expression values with sequence similarity to the SE-cephalotoxin and Rapunzel genes. Comparative analyses showed that despite being closely related, there may be significant variation among the venoms of freshwater stingrays, highlighting the importance of considering elicit care in handling different envenomation cases. Since hyaluronidase represents a major component of fish venom, we have performed phylogenetic and selective pressure analyses of this gene/protein across all fish with the available information. Results indicated an independent recruitment of the hyaluronidase into the stingray venom relative to that of venomous bony fish. The hyaluronidase residues were found to be mostly under negative selection, but 18 sites showed evidence of diversifying positive selection (P < 0.05). Our data provides new insight into stingray venom variation, composition, and selective pressure in hyaluronidase.",Combination of a Bioceramic Scaffold and Simvastatin Nanoparticles as a Synthetic Alternative to Autologous Bone Grafting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567319,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"The fragile nature of porous bioceramic substitutes cannot match the toughness of bone, which limits the use of these materials in clinical load-bearing applications. Statins can enhance bone healing, but it could show rhabdomyolysis/inflammatory response after overdosing. In this study, the drug-containing bone grafts were developed from poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles encapsulating simvastatin (SIM) (SIM-PP NPs) loaded within an appropriately mechanical bioceramic scaffold (BC). The combination bone graft provides dual functions of osteoconduction and osteoinduction. The mechanical properties of the bioceramic are enhanced mainly based on the admixture of a combustible reverse-negative thermoresponsive hydrogel (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide base). We showed that SIM-PP NPs can increase the activity of alkaline phosphatase and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. To verify the bone-healing efficacy of this drug-containing bone grafts, a nonunion radial endochondral ossification bone defect rabbit model (N = 3/group) and a nonunion calvarial intramembranous defect Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model (N = 5/group) were used. The results indicated that SIM-PP NPs combined with BC can improve the healing of nonunion bone defects of the radial bone and calvarial bone. Therefore, the BC containing SIM-PP NPs may be appropriate for clinical use as a synthetic alternative to autologous bone grafting that can overcome the problem of determining the clinical dosage of simvastatin drugs to promote bone healing.",Constrained α-Helical Peptides as Inhibitors of Protein-Protein and Protein-DNA Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567318,Biomedicines,2019 01 11,"Intracellular regulatory pathways are replete with protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, offering attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. So far, most drugs are targeted toward enzymes and extracellular receptors. Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have long been considered as ""undruggable"". Protein-DNA interactions, in particular, present a difficult challenge due to the repetitive nature of the B-DNA. Recent studies have provided several breakthroughs; however, a design methodology for these classes of inhibitors is still at its infancy. A dominant motif of these macromolecular interactions is an α-helix, raising possibilities that an appropriate conformationally-constrained α-helical peptide may specifically disrupt these interactions. Several methods for conformationally constraining peptides to the α-helical conformation have been developed, including stapling, covalent surrogates of hydrogen bonds and incorporation of unnatural amino acids that restrict the conformational space of the peptide. We will discuss these methods and several case studies where constrained α-helices have been used as building blocks for appropriate molecules. Unlike small molecules, the delivery of these short peptides to their targets is not straightforward as they may possess unfavorable cell penetration and ADME properties. Several methods have been developed in recent times to overcome some of these problems. We will discuss these issues and the prospects of this class of molecules as drugs.",Synergic Activity Against MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cell Growth of Nanocurcumin-Encapsulated and Cisplatin-Complexed Nanogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567316,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Nanogel-based systems loaded with single anticancer drugs display miscellaneous effectiveness in tumor remission, gradually circumventing mutation and resistance in chemotherapy. Hence, the existence of dual-drug delivered nano-sized systems has been contemporaneous with drug development and preceded the conventional-dose chemotherapy. Among outstanding synergistic drug nanoplatforms, thermosensitive copolymer heparin-Pluronic F127 (Hep-F127) co-delivering cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumins (Cur) (Hep-F127/CDDP/Cur) has emerged as a notable candidate for temperature-responsive drug delivery. The procedure was based on the entrapment of curcumin into the hydrophobic core of bio-degradable co-polymer Hep-F127 while the hydrophilic drug CDDP subsequently conjugated to the backbone heparin to form the core-shell structure. The copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), to corroborate the successful synthesis and via HPLC along with AES-ICP to evaluate the high drug loading along with a controllable release from the nano-gels. A well-defined nano-shell with size in the 129.3 ± 3.8 nm size range could enhance higher the efficacy of the conjugated-CDDP to Hep-F127 than that of single doses. Moreover, the considerable amount of dual-drug released from thermosensitive nanogels between different conditions (pH = 7.4 and pH = 5.5) in comparison to CDDP from Hep-F127 partially indicated the significantly anti-proliferative ability of Hep-F127/CDDP/Cur to the MCF-7 cell line. Remarkably, drug testing in a xenograft model elucidates the intricate synergism of co-delivery in suppressing tumor growth, which remedies some of the problems affecting in cancer chemotherapy.",PI3Kinases in Diabetes Mellitus and Its Related Complications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567315,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"Recent studies have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) have become the target of many pharmacological treatments, both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. PI3Ks play an important role in glucose regulation, and this suggests their possible involvement in the onset of diabetes mellitus. In this review, we gather our knowledge regarding the effects of PI3K isoforms on glucose regulation in several organs and on the most clinically-relevant complications of diabetes mellitus, such as cardiomyopathy, vasculopathy, nephropathy, and neurological disease. For instance, PI3K α has been proven to be protective against diabetes-induced heart failure, while PI3K γ inhibition is protective against the disease onset. In vessels, PI3K γ can generate oxidative stress, while PI3K β inhibition is anti-thrombotic. Finally, we describe the role of PI3Ks in Alzheimer's disease and ADHD, discussing the relevance for diabetic patients. Given the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, the multiple effects here described should be taken into account for the development and validation of drugs acting on PI3Ks."

Although it can give information on ocular status and be used for follow-ups, tear analysis is challenging due to the low amount of sample that is available. Proximity extension assay (PEA) allows for a sensitive and scalable analysis of multiple proteins in a single run from a one-µL sample, so we applied this technique and examined the amount of 184 proteins in tears collected at different time points after trabeculectomy. The success rate of this surgical intervention highly depends on proper wound healing; therefore, information on the process is indispensable. We observed significantly higher levels of IL-6 and MMP1 at the early time points (day one, two, and four) following trabeculectomy, and the protein amounts went back to the level observed before the surgery three months after the intervention. Patients with or without complications were tested, and proteins that have roles in the immune response and wound healing could be observed with altered frequency and amounts in the cases of patients with complications. Our results highlight the importance of inflammation in wound-healing complications, and at the same time, indicate the utility of PEA in tear analysis.",Prion Strain-Specific Structure and Pathology: A View from the Perspective of Glycobiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567302,Viruses,2019 05 08,"Prion diseases display multiple disease phenotypes characterized by diverse clinical symptoms, different brain regions affected by the disease, distinct cell tropism and diverse PrPSc deposition patterns. The diversity of disease phenotypes within the same host is attributed to the ability of PrPC to acquire multiple, alternative, conformationally distinct, self-replicating PrPSc states referred to as prion strains or subtypes. Structural diversity of PrPSc strains has been well documented, yet the question of how different PrPSc structures elicit multiple disease phenotypes remains poorly understood. The current article reviews emerging evidence suggesting that carbohydrates in the form of sialylated N-linked glycans, which are a constitutive part of PrPSc, are important players in defining strain-specific structures and disease phenotypes. This article introduces a new hypothesis, according to which individual strain-specific PrPSc structures govern selection of PrPC sialoglycoforms that form strain-specific patterns of carbohydrate epitopes on PrPSc surface and contribute to defining the disease phenotype and outcomes.",ZNF521 Represses Osteoblastic Differentiation in Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567301,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 03 29,"Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal cells that can differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. During osteoblastogenesis, the osteoprogenitor cells differentiate into mature osteoblasts and synthesize bone matrix components. Zinc finger protein 521 (ZNF521/Zfp521) is a transcription co-factor implicated in the regulation of hematopoietic, neural, and mesenchymal stem cells, where it has been shown to inhibit adipogenic differentiation. The present study is aimed at determining the effects of ZNF521 on the osteoblastic differentiation of hADSCs to clarify whether it can influence their osteogenic commitment. The enforced expression or silencing of ZNF521 in hADSCs was achieved by lentiviral vector transduction. Cells were cultured in a commercial osteogenic medium for up to 20 days. The ZNF521 enforced expression significantly reduced osteoblast development as assessed by the morphological and molecular criteria, resulting in reduced levels of collagen I, alkaline phosphatase, osterix, osteopontin, and calcium deposits. Conversely, ZNF521 silencing, in response to osteoblastic stimuli, induced a significant increase in early molecular markers of osteogenesis and, at later stages, a remarkable enhancement of matrix mineralization. Together with our previous findings, these results show that ZNF521 inhibits both adipocytic and osteoblastic maturation in hADSCs and suggest that its expression may contribute to maintaining the immature properties of hADSCs.",The Significance of Lipids to Biofilm Formation in Candida albicans: An Emerging Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567300,"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2018 12 20,"Candida albicans, the dimorphic opportunistic human fungal pathogen, is capable of forming highly drug-resistant biofilms in the human host. Formation of biofilm is a multistep and multiregulatory process involving various adaptive mechanisms. The ability of cells in a biofilm to alter membrane lipid composition is one such adaptation crucial for biofilm development in C. albicans. Lipids modulate mixed species biofilm formation in vivo and inherent antifungal resistance associated with these organized communities. Cells in C. albicans biofilms display phase-dependent changes in phospholipid classes and in levels of lipid raft formation. Systematic studies with genetically modified strains in which the membrane phospholipid composition can be manipulated are limited in C. albicans. In this review, we summarize the knowledge accumulated on the impact that alterations in phospholipids may have on the biofilm forming ability of C. albicans in the human host. This review may provide the requisite impetus to analyze lipids from a therapeutic standpoint in managing C. albicans biofilms.",Hyaluronate-Functionalized Graphene for Label-Free Electrochemical Cytosensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567299,Micromachines,2019 01 11,"Electrochemical sensors for early tumor cell detection are currently an important area of research, as this special region directly improves the efficiency of cancer treatment. Functional graphene is a promising alternative for selective recognition and capture of target cancer cells. In our work, an effective cytosensor of hyaluronate-functionalized graphene (HG) was prepared through chemical reduction of graphene oxide. The as-prepared HG nanostructures were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy coupled with cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The self-assembly of HG with ethylene diamine, followed by sodium hyaluronate, enabled the fabrication of a label-free electrochemical impedance spectroscopy cytosensor with high stability and biocompatibility. Finally, the proposed cytosensor exhibited satisfying electrochemical behavior and cell-capture capacity for human colorectal cancer cells HCT-116, and also displayed a wide linear range, from 5.0 × 10² cells∙mL-1 to 5.0 × 10⁶ cells∙mL-1, and a low detection limit of 100 cells∙mL-1 (S/N = 3) for quantification.

An example is the potential role of the popular sire effect in perpetuating genetic defects. If male dogs are more likely than bitches to be identified as examples of members of a breed that align with breed standard, they may be selected for breeding earlier. This may contribute to the influence of individual males and contribute to popular sire effect. Conversely, if breed standards are written in a sex-neutral fashion, and if dogs are entered, exhibited, and judged in a sex-neutral fashion, then we would expect the success of female dogs in the show ring to be equal to that of their male counterparts. With a focus on toy and giant breeds, the current pilot study collated samples of dog show results to explore relationships between sex and the likelihood of success in the show ring. It focused on toy and giant breeds to explore any differences in equity, if it existed, at either end of the size and concomitant age-at-maturation spectrum. For the purpose of this study, toy breeds were those that weigh < 10 kg at maturity while giant breed dogs were those that exceed 45 kg. Within these two clusters, the least (n = 3) and most popular (n = 3) breeds were then selected to explore any potential role of sex on success in the show ring. The popularity of breeds was determined using the numbers of dogs registered with the Australian National Kennel Council. Using results from dog shows (n = 18) from 2015 to 2016, data on 1,080 dogs were obtained. Within these 12 breeds for the 18 shows, there were 137 Best of Breed (BOB) titles awarded: Pug (n = 18), Toy Poodle (n = 18), Bullmastiff (n = 14), Rottweiler (n = 17), Fox Terrier (Smooth) (n = 18), Bloodhound (n = 3), Schnauzer (miniature) (n = 15), Great Dane (n = 17), Norfolk Terrier (n = 10), Norwich Terrier (n = 5), Central Asian Shepherd Dog (n = 2). Despite the near parity of male and female dogs being exhibited, of these 137 titles, 86 (62.8%) were awarded to male dogs (at least 41 individuals) and 51 (37.2%) to female dogs (at least 32 individuals) showing that male dogs are more likely to win BOB titles (χ² = 9.4455, df = 1, p-value = 0.002117). Among the toy subset of breeds, this effect was higher (χ² = 6.798, df = 1, p-value = 0.009126) than among the giant breed subset, for whom the advantage to male dogs did not reach statistical significance versus χ² = 3.0967, df = 1, p-value = 0.07845). This suggests that judges find the male dogs more appealing, presumably because they are more aligned with breed standards.","Rhyzobius lophanthae Behavior is Influenced by Cycad Plant Age, Providing Odor Samples in a Y-tube Olfactometer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567297,Insects,2019 05 07,"The scale predator Rhyzobius lophanthae Blaisdell was introduced to Guam and Rota to control invasive Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi armored scale infestations on the native Cycas micronesica K.D. Hill populations. The predator demonstrated a clear preference for A. yasumatsui infesting adult plants, resulting in 100% seedling mortality due to the lack of a biocontrol of the scale on seedlings. A Y-tube olfactometer was employed to determine if scale-infested seedling leaves were less attractive to R. lophanthae than scale-infested mature tree leaves. Five paired combinations of seedling versus mature tree leaves were used. The R. lophanthae adults navigated toward scale-infested and un-infested leaves of adults and seedlings when paired with an empty chamber. However, a clear preference for adult leaves occurred when paired with seedling leaves. The results were unambiguous in charcoal-filtered air, intermediate in unfiltered air from an open laboratory, and most ambiguous when conducted with unfiltered in-situ air. The number of predators that did not make a choice was greatest for in-situ air and least for charcoal-filtered air. These results indicated that the substrate used in olfactometry influenced the results, and interpretations of charcoal-filtered air assays should be made with caution. Volatile chemical cues are involved in R. lophanthae preferring A. yasumatsui located on C. micronesica adults when infested adult and seedling leaves are present.",Predictivity of Autoimmune Stigmata for Gluten Sensitivity in Subjects with Microscopic Enteritis: A Retrospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567296,Nutrients,2019 02 15,"Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is an emerging gluten-related condition. We investigated whether the presence of autoimmune stigmata in a group of patients with clinical suspicion of NCGS and a histological picture of microscopic enteritis (ME) could be a predictive factor of NCGS. Patients with ME were followed up by periodical examinations. At baseline, we collected data about previous clinical history, including autoimmune diseases. NCGS was diagnosed according to Salerno criteria; other causes of ME were diagnosed according to well-established protocols. Patients with celiac disease were excluded. Student's and chi-square tests were used in univariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Sixty-three patients were included. Twenty-two had a final diagnosis of NCGS; the remaining 41 had non-gluten-related causes of ME. Prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis was higher among NCGS patients (40.1%) than in other ME (14.6%; p = 0.03). NCGS showed higher positivity rate for anti-gliadin (27.3% versus 2.5%; p = 0.006) and anti-nucleus (45.4% versus 12.2%; p = 0.005). Autoimmune thyroiditis had a non-significant trend (p = 0.06) for NCGS diagnosis, (HR = 2.4). Both anti-gliadin (HR = 2.4; p = 0.04) and anti-nucleus (HR = 2.7; p = 0.04) were directly associated with NCGS diagnosis.

The rheology, slump flow, V-funnel, segregation degree (SA), and compressive strength of SCC are investigated. Microstructure characteristics, including hydration product and pore structure, are also studied. The results show that adding MK and SF instead of 4%, 6% and 8% fly ash (FA) reduces flowability of SCC; this is due to the fact that the specific surface area of MK and SF is larger than FA, and the total water demand increases as a result. However, the flowability increases when replacement ratio is 2%, as the small MK and SF particles will fill in the interstitial space of mixture and more free water is released. The fluidity, slump flow, and SA decrease linearly with the increase of yield stress. The total amount of SF and MK should be no more than 6% to meet the requirement of self-compacting. Adding MK or SF to SCC results in more hydration products, less Ca(OH)₂ and refinement of pore structure, leading to obvious strength and durability improvements. When the total dosage of MK and SF admixture is 6%, these beneficial effects on workability, mechanical performance, and microstructure are more significant when SF and MK are applied together."

Quick intervention with aggressive antithyroid therapy, including steroid pulse, and supportive intensive care measures led to an outstanding improvement and full recovery. The present case clearly shows the beneficial impact of initial clinical suspicion resulting in an early diagnosis and intensive therapy. Moreover, it supports the additional role of steroids to aggressive antithyroid strategy in order to control associated deleterious systemic inflammatory reactions."

She presented in a normal conscious and cognitive state. Management involved intravenous diuresis with frusemide and blood transfusion. She quickly begun to develop fever, severe polyarticular arthropathy and progressive encephalopathy. Analgesia was started and antibiotics administered for potential septic sources. Extensive investigations, including full septic screen and neurological imaging, revealed no explainable aetiology for her precipitous decline. She continued to have febrile episodes, worsening polyarticular arthropathy and progressive encephalopathy eventually becoming unresponsive. Given the severe polyarticular arthropathy knee aspiration was performed. Urate crystals were identified and intravenous hydrocortisone and colchicine were started.

A urine toxicology screen is positive for cannabis and negative for cocaine and other stimulant drugs. An emergent cardiac catheterisation reveals no evidence of coronary artery disease or thrombosis. A diagnosis of coronary vasospasm is strongly considered, and the patient is started on calcium channel blocker, with a resolution of symptoms and ECG changes. Marijuana-induced coronary spasm causing myocardial infarction has rarely been reported. Marijuana is becoming a social norm in adolescents and there remains a misconception that it is harmless and even beneficial.

Osteoporotic fractures occur approximately 10 years later in men than in women due to higher peak bone mass. However, 30% of all hip fractures occur in men. Risk factors of osteoporotic fractures can be grouped into primary and secondary causes. We present the case of a 53-year-old man, who suffered a compression fracture of a lumbar vertebra after a generalised seizure and an atraumatic rib fracture 5 months later. We could exclude secondary causes of bone mineral loss such as primary hyperparathyroidism, glucocorticoid use and hypogonadism. However, a heterozygous missense mutation of the COL1A1 gene in exon 48 in further search of a secondary cause was found. Therapy was changed from bisphosphonate treatment to teriparatide. Considering the lack of other osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) symptoms and signs, the patient's illness can be classified as mild.

Although there is no definite standard of care for the optimal treatment for PTLD, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, with and/or without chemotherapy (usually CHOP=cytoxan, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) has become a routine part of the treatment of any CD20 (+) PTLD, with response rates similar to chemotherapy with decreased toxicity. A rare and often lethal, complication of rituximab therapy for PTLD is bowel perforation secondary to tumour lysis of lymphoma involving the intestine. A small number of cases of bowel perforation have been reported, with very few documented survivors. The risk for recurrent perforation in the setting of ongoing rituximab treatment is unknown. There is sparse data supporting how to best treat the survivors.",Difficult case of a rare form of familial Alzheimer's disease with PSEN1 P117L mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567237,BMJ case reports,2019 03 29,"Less than 10% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are familial.

At age 32 he was referred to our neurology clinic, presenting cognitive impairment, cerebellar syndrome, axial myoclonus and hypomimia, without other signs of parkinsonism. Because of absence of family history, he was worked up along the line of spinal ataxic disorders. Later, he developed pseudobulbar affect, cognitive deterioration, right upper limb paresis and spastic paraparesis. Subsequent investigation identified a PSEN1 P117L mutation and the diagnosis of autosomal dominant AD was made. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge imposed by atypical presentation of de novo PSEN1 mutation, leading to unnecessary investigation. Genetic study might be essential for defining the diagnosis."

We describe a simple and effective technique to overcome the step-off between the intermediate catheter and an intracranial vessel stenosis during thrombectomy. The patient presented with acute embolic left middle cerebral artery occlusion and a favorable penumbral pattern. Clot access was made challenging by focal stenosis in the ipsilateral cavernous segment. The balloon-assisted tracking technique was effective in traversing the step-off to enable TICI 3 aspiration thrombectomy. This simple and effective technique should be kept in mind during stroke procedures where a proximal stenotic obstacle complicates access to the site of occlusion.,Choroidal melanoma masquerading as orbital cellulitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567222,BMJ case reports,2019 05 20,"Orbital cellulitis is the most common subset of orbital inflammatory disease.

Histopathological analysis of the specimen revealed intraocular necrotic melanoma with very few recognisable melanoma cells. The necrotic subtype is more commonly associated with extrascleral extension, distant metastasis and poorer prognosis than other melanoma types.

She had been treated for brucellosis initially with doxycycline and streptomycin. Due to subsequent appearance of myositis, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were added for treatment of localised brucellosis. After intravenous administration of rifampicin, the patient deteriorated significantly. After exclusion of other causes of haemolysis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia related to rifampicin was established by strongly positive direct Coombs test. Drug withdrawal in conjunction with intravenous immune globulin and prednisolone resulted in resolution of haemolysis and no relapse in the ensuing 1-year period.

The crowbar had entered from the left-upper quadrant and was tenting the skin of the right iliac fossa. Analgesia and prehospital sedation were provided to facilitate extrication. A series of improvisations were carried out to support the logistics of transferring the patient using an air ambulance to the regional major trauma centre with the crowbar in situ. The patient was taken to the operating theatre without any imaging and a section of perforated bowel was removed.

These tumours can present as transient, reversible cardiomyopathy similar to takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). TCM is characterised by transient hypokinesis of the left ventricular apex and is typically induced by emotional stress. We describe the case of a 26-year-old woman with a medical history significant for headaches who presented initially to her family physician with nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension. She was started on lisinopril 10 mg daily. One week later, she presented to the emergency department with substernal severe chest pressure. Her troponin level was elevated.

The first patient, a 65-year-old woman, presented with life-threatening upper GI bleeding almost 5 years after laparoscopic RYGB. The second patient, a 62-year-old woman, presented with upper GI bleeding after almost 14 years following RYGB. Both, due to an eroding marginal ulcer. We discuss here the management of a rare and catastrophic complication of late GI bleeding and review the various reports in the literature describing the late bleeding as a complication of gastric bypass. Late GI bleeding after RYGB presents a diagnostic and interventional challenge.

Although the P. vivax infection was successfully treated, she still had intermittent, high-grade fever, developed dyspnoea and bilateral interstitial pneumonitis shown in the chest X-ray. Thus, coinfection was suspected, and empirical antibiotics were given. The second serological test confirmed the concomitant murine typhus infection, and antibiotics treatment were successful with the complete recovery. This case emphasises that an initial negative murine typhus serological test does not necessarily rule out the presence of the disease. A follow-up murine typhus serological or molecular test within 1-2 weeks is therefore recommended.",Rare case of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion complication in a patient with Zenker's diverticulum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567215,BMJ case reports,2019 05 20,"We present a case of Zenker's diverticulum in a 45-year-old woman, occurred as complication after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for a cervical spine injury.

A 16-year-old girl was admitted for urticaria, angioedema, nausea and vomiting a month later she had been diagnosed with MS and treated with high-dosage methylprednisolone. Laboratory investigations showed hepatic insufficiency with grossly elevated liver enzymes. A liver biopsy showed focal centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis with interface hepatitis. Methylprednisolone-induced hepatotoxicity can confuse the clinical picture of patients with MS and complicate the differential diagnosis. We believe that each specialist should know it and monitor patients with MS taking high doses of methylprednisolone. As there is no screening model that predicts idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, we promote screening for potential liver injury following pulse steroid therapy.",Repair of displaced thyroid cartilage fracture using miniplate osteosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567200,BMJ case reports,2019 03 27,"Acute laryngeal trauma is estimated to occur in approximately one patient per 14 500 to 42 500 emergency room admissions. If the larynx is injured, its vital functions are affected and can be threatened in case of severe injury. Soft cartilage offers no protective advantage, which is the reason why young as well as older individuals are at risk of thyroid cartilage fracture. Experimentation on cadaver larynx has demonstrated that virtually all laryngeal fractures are longitudinally oriented. Furthermore, muscular pull can contribute to a misalignment of the fractures. As stated by Bent and Porubsky, a fracture is considered severely rather than moderately displaced, if it is freely mobile on physical examination, has more than two fracture lines or demonstrates a displacement greater than the width of the thyroid cartilage on CT imaging. We present two cases of severely displaced thyroid cartilage fracture treated in our department by open reduction and internal fixation using miniplates.

This case involves a patient who had been initiated on liothyronine (L-T3) for this purpose and subsequently became pregnant. The exogenous T3 affected maternal thyroid hormone production, including suppression of her thyroxine (T4) levels. In pregnancy, maternal T4 is important for fetal neurodevelopment. Accordingly, use of exogenous T3 for adjunct treatment of depression in pregnant patients or those planning pregnancy requires careful laboratory monitoring of thyroid function tests. In this case, L-T3 was discontinued and the patient was eventually started on levothyroxine (L-T4) and went on to have an uneventful pregnancy.",Successful management of proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immune deposits with combined immunosuppressive therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567197,BMJ case reports,2019 03 27,"Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immune deposits (PGNMID) is a newly described entity characterised by monoclonal IgG deposits consisting of single light chain isotype and single heavy chain subtype (IgG1-4) in the kidneys.

Special staining for subclass of IgG showed monoclonal IgG3-kappa (case 1) and IgG1-kappa deposits (case 2) suggestive of PGNMID. Workup for underlying infection, malignancy, monoclonal gammopathy was negative. Since pathogenesis of PGNMID involves clonal proliferation of B-cells, we treated both patients with rituximab along with steroids that led to improvement of proteinuria and renal function. We also reviewed current literature to assess efficacy of rituximab in treatment of PGNMID. However, a larger pool of patients and a longer follow-up period is required to establish a role of rituximab and steroids in the treatment of this disease entity.",Möbius syndrome associated with obesity and precocious puberty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567196,BMJ case reports,2019 03 27,"Möbius syndrome is a neurological disorder involving underdevelopment of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves.

Coronary CT angiography showed a calcium score of 0 together with the absence of atherosclerotic plaques and normal origin and course of the coronary arteries. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography revealed an infracentimetric round-shaped mobile mass attached to a secondary tendinous chord of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Cardiac magnetic resonance further evidenced localised contrast uptake supporting vascular irrigation, making thrombus unlikely. After surgical excision, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Histopathology disclosed the typical collagenous matrix covered by a single cell layer. Although mostly benign, cardiac tumours are prone to embolisation and can thus mimic an acute coronary syndrome. Multimodality imaging has an important role in unmasking the true mechanism, revealing less common aetiologies and elucidating the possibility of curative surgical resection.",Left main coronary artery atresia complicated by fistulae between the left anterior descending artery and the right ventricle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567171,BMJ case reports,2019 04 03,"This case describes a 60-year-old man with congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), with fistulae between the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right ventricle (RV).

Source of gram-negative bacteraemia is usually isolated to an intra-abdominal or a pelvic source. Proteus bacteraemia from an intrathoracic pathology is very uncommon, and in this case led to a delay in diagnosis. Although an infected aneurysm is a rare source of gram-negative bacteraemia, it must always be considered when common causes of bacteraemia have been ruled out especially in patients with vascular risk factors.","Infection of lung cavitations in a young dog owner with Hodgkin's lymphoma caused by Pasteurella multocida, without a dog bite: confirmed zoonotic transmission by tagmentation microbiome analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567168,BMJ case reports,2019 04 03,"Pasteurella multocida is a known pathogen in humans, mostly reported after animal bite incidents.

Shortly after finishing antibiotic treatment, she quickly developed the same symptoms of pneumonia. Bronchoscopy showed a large cavity in the right upper lobe and P. multocida was isolated from all bronchial cultures. The transmission route of P. multocida via the patient's dog was confirmed by sampling the full genome of the dog's mouth, which matched the unique P. multocida sequences found in the patient. This case demonstrates the importance of accurately determining the aetiology of the patient's symptoms, and Pasteurella infection should be considered in all immunocompromised patients with domestic animal contact, even without a bite incident.",Bone marrow metastases in salivary duct carcinoma of the parotid gland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567167,BMJ case reports,2019 04 03,"Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare and extremely aggressive salivary gland cancer.

Seldom are they seen following decompression for spinal stenosis and may be actually more frequent and under-reported? Emergent surgical exploration remains the mainstay of management as the factors responsible for postop CES remains a variety of compressive forces. Yet many a time postoperative imaging or surgical exploration fails to identify a pathology and this leads to an ischaemic theory responsible for CES. Our article highlights conservative management in these selective group. We share our experience in two cases of incomplete CES during our routine transforaminal interbody fusion which we followed closely without re-exploration eventually ending in a favourable outcome. Key messages: The factors responsible for postop CES remains mostly a variety of compressive forces though in some instances postoperative imaging or surgical exploration fails to identify such in some cases. This leads to an ischaemic theory responsible for CES. The role of conservative management of postoperative CES in certain selective cases has a favourable outcome as illustrated in our cases.,Acute eosinophilic appendicitis simulating uncomplicated appendicitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567130,BMJ case reports,2019 04 10,"Acute appendicitis is one of the most common abdominal emergencies worldwide.

A 20-year-old Japanese woman emergently presented with the chief complaint of pain at the right iliac fossa. CT showed only swelling of the appendix. She was diagnosed with UA, and she received antibiotic therapy initially. However, the treatment was not effective and appendectomy was performed. The final histopathological diagnosis was AEA. The findings of this case suggest that AEA is likely to be diagnosed as UA. As AEA can simulate UA, the possibility of AEA should be considered when antibiotic therapy is not effective.",Simultaneous treatment of ischaemic bowel and ischaemic stroke with intravenous thrombolysis therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567129,BMJ case reports,2019 04 10,"Novel treatment of simultaneous mesenteric and cerebral ischaemia with systemic thrombolysis.

Meropenem was ceased and liver function normalised. Meropenem was administered for a second time later in the patient's admission and again the patient developed rapidly increasing liver enzymes, with a mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern. Other possible causes of liver injury were excluded following extensive investigations, and the patient's liver enzymes continued to normalise following meropenem discontinuation. The patient was asymptomatic during the admission and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

He was initiated on liraglutide injections with hopes to achieve better glycaemic control, but developed unrelenting nausea and vomiting during the third week of treatment. He presented to the hospital with these symptoms and was noted to have severe MALA. He sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest requiring emergent resuscitation along with vasopressor and mechanical ventilator support. He underwent continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration to remove metformin and correct the acidosis, following which he stabilised and supportive therapy was weaned off.

A total of 14 direct current cardioversion shocks were given and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved post thrombolysis. Subsequent CT pulmonary angiography excluded PE. A post-ROSC ECG demonstrated anterolateral ST elevation and she was transferred to the local cardiac unit for angiography. This revealed extensive dissection of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with proximal occlusion. The diagnosis therefore was pregnancy-associated spontaneous artery dissection, a type of acute coronary syndrome. She received percutaneous intervention to her LAD with five drug-eluting stents. The patient survived and was discharged 5 days later.

However, a broad-range PCR coupled with electrospray-ionisation mass spectrometry onto the PLEX-ID automat of peripheral blood revealed the presence of varicella zoster virus. There was a specific viral load in whole blood of 20 542 copies/ml. It is presumed that Varicella myocarditis was the likely cause of death. Our case illustrates the potential usefulness of a broad range PCR strategy in determining infectious causes of death in sudden infant death.

It encompasses two steps: resection of the superior and inferior pyramids. Full resection is achieved by staying close to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In this technique, the dissection principle is to remove anterior commissure in two pyramid fashions without having to actually follow the tumour. This method is easy and simple to master. Two years postoperatively, the patient has no signs of recurrence and is able to use her voice and has full swallowing ability.",Successful outcome after spontaneous first trimester intra-amniotic haematoma and early preterm premature rupture of membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567082,BMJ case reports,2019 04 05,"A spontaneous intra-amniotic haematoma is a rare cause of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) but can have significant fetal and maternal consequences.

Among the 12 provinces (municipality and autonomous region) being endemic of schistosomiasis japonica in P. R. China, 5 provinces (municipality and autonomous region), i.e., Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi, continued to consolidate the status of elimination of schistosomiasis. Sichuan Province achieved the transmission interruption and 6 provinces of Yunnan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hunan kept the transmission control by the end of 2017. There were 450 endemic counties (cities, districts) covering 259 million people, specifically including 28 544 endemic villages of 70 324.5 thousand people at risk. Among the 450 endemic counties (cities, districts), 47.78% (215/450), 34.00% (153/450) and 18.22% (82/450) reached the criteria of elimination, transmission interruption and transmission control, respectively. By the end of 2017, a total of 8 401 113 individuals received schistosomiasis examinations and 14 individuals were parasitologically diagnosed, decreased by 97.67% compared with 600 cases in 2016. It was estimated of 37 601 cases of schistosome infection, decreased by 30.95% compared with 54 454 cases in 2016. One acute schistosomiasis case was reported in 2017. There were 29 407 advanced schistosomiasis cases documented in 2017. Oncomelania hupensis snail surveys were performed in 19 784 endemic villages and O. hupensis snails were found in 7 310 villages, accounting for 36.95% of total villages, with 19 newly detected villages with snails.The snail survey covered an area of 622454.49 hm2 and snails were found in an area of 172501.56 hm2, including a newly detected area of 208.54 hm2. No schistosome-infected snails were found in 2017. A total of 737 016 bovines were raised in the schistosomiasis endemic areas. Of them, 454 830 bovines received the examinations for schistosome infection, and 1 bovine was stool examination positive. There were 119 326 schistosomiasis cases receiving chemotherapy in 2017, with 1 973 968 individuals undergoing expanded chemotherapy; one bovine with schistosomiasis receiving chemotherapy, with 418 925 bovines undergoing expanded chemotherapy. A total of 144 605.31 hm2 area with snail was controlled by using molluscicides, with actual molluscicide-treated area of 73 755.37 hm2; and 5 002.92 hm2 area with snail was treated by environmental modification. Based on the data from the 457 national schistosomiasis surveillance sites, the mean Schistosoma japonicum infection rate was 0.001 6% and 0 in humans and bovines, respectively. No schistosome-infected snails were found by microscopic examinations in all the surveillance sites, and 7 snail samples with schistosome nucleic acid positive were detected by loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) among 6 surveillance sites. The results demonstrate a continuous decline trend on the endemic situation of schistosomiasis in P. R. China. However, the risk of epidemic rebound still exists in some regions and it is still a challenge to achieve the target set by the Thirteenth Five-Year National Plan for Schistosomiasis Control in 2020.",Climate change resilience of a globally important sea turtle nesting population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567014,Global change biology,2019 03 25,"Few studies have looked into climate change resilience of populations of wild animals. We use a model higher vertebrate, the green sea turtle, as its life history is fundamentally affected by climatic conditions, including temperature-dependent sex determination and obligate use of beaches subject to sea level rise (SLR). We use empirical data from a globally important population in West Africa to assess resistance to climate change within a quantitative framework. We project 200 years of primary sex ratios (1900-2100) and create a digital elevation model of the nesting beach to estimate impacts of projected SLR. Primary sex ratio is currently almost balanced, with 52% of hatchlings produced being female. Under IPCC models, we predict: (a) an increase in the proportion of females by 2100 to 76%-93%, but cooler temperatures, both at the end of the nesting season and in shaded areas, will guarantee male hatchling production; (b) IPCC SLR scenarios will lead to 33.4%-43.0% loss of the current nesting area; (c) climate change will contribute to population growth through population feminization, with 32%-64% more nesting females expected by 2120; (d) as incubation temperatures approach lethal levels, however, the population will cease growing and start to decline. Taken together with other factors (degree of foraging plasticity, rookery size and trajectory, and prevailing threats), this nesting population should resist climate change until 2100, and the availability of spatial and temporal microrefugia indicates potential for resilience to predicted impacts, through the evolution of nest site selection or changes in nesting phenology. This represents the most comprehensive assessment to date of climate change resilience of a marine reptile using the most up-to-date IPCC models, appraising the impacts of temperature and SLR, integrated with additional ecological and demographic parameters. We suggest this as a framework for other populations, species and taxa.",An HPLC method for the determination of adenosine diphosphate: An important marker of hexokinase activity in metabolic diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567013,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,2019 04 08,"Hexokinases play a critical role in the cellular uptake and utilization of glucose. As such, they are of fundamental importance to all cells. By catalyzing glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, hexokinases control the first irreversible step of glucose metabolism and initiate all major pathways of glucose consumption. Our objective was to develop and validate highly sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) assays allowing the determination of adenosine diphosphate, which was used for the determination of hexokinase activity. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-PDA using a C18 analytical column (250 × 4.6 mm) for chromatographic separation. Optimal detection was achieved based on isocratic elution with a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of sodium phosphate monobasic buffer and methanol. This method met all of the requirements of specificity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and stability generally accepted in bioanalytical chemistry and was successfully applied to a study of hexokinase activity in an alloxan-induced diabetic rat model.

While outcomes are similar between primary and secondary (revision) ASR to treat caudal septal deviation, there was a significantly higher rate of autologous rib harvest, highlighting the importance of addressing deviations of the caudal septum at the primary procedure to reduce morbidity related to rib graft harvest and revision surgery.",Disparities in NOSE Scores and Surgical Approaches among Patients Undergoing Functional Rhinoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566989,Facial plastic surgery : FPS,2019 06 06,"Social determinants of health have been widely studied throughout medicine; however, their role relating to functional rhinoplasty has not been previously evaluated. The records of 178 patients who underwent functional rhinoplasty in a single health network from 2013 to 2016 were reviewed. The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score was used to assess patient-reported symptoms, and patients with both preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores were included in this study. Basic demographics and surgical techniques were also collected. Differences between NOSE scores and surgical approaches to functional rhinoplasty on the basis of insurance type were measured. One hundred and sixteen patients were included for analysis, the mean age was 34.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 16.2) and 57 (49.1%) were female. Twenty-one (18.1%) patients had public insurance and, of these, 18 patients had Medicaid. Patients (mean, SD) with Medicaid insurance (56.39, 15.6) had a slightly greater improvement in NOSE scores compared with patients with non-Medicaid insurance (47.90, 25.6) (p = 0.067). There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative NOSE scores or postoperative improvement in NOSE scores between patients with different health insurance. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in surgical approaches. The majority of patients receiving functional rhinoplasty had private insurance. Medicaid patients trended toward a greater NOSE score improvement after functional rhinoplasty, but also had a closer association with a history of nasal trauma and prior surgery. Future study is needed to better understand the association between socioeconomic status and disparities in care. Understanding how social determinants of health affect patients may reveal potential inherent biases, improve delivery of care, and translate to better patient outcomes.",Use of Tissue Expander for Contracted Scarred Saddle Deformity Rhinoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566988,Facial plastic surgery : FPS,2019 06 06,"The main purpose of this article is to present an alternative technique for the reconstruction of saddle nose deformity in patients with severely scarred or contracted soft tissue envelopes. In this single surgeon case series, the authors present a two-staged reconstruction performed on four adult patients with saddle nose deformities and contracted soft tissue envelope stemming from a variety of etiologic factors including vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and trauma. Stage one involved placement of a 1 × 4 cm tissue expander along the nasal dorsum through anterior scalp and endonasal incisions. The tissue expander port was positioned under the anterior scalp and injected with saline over 3 weeks in-office. Stage two involved removal of the tissue expander and rhinoplasty using osteocartilaginous rib grafts. All four patients had successful expansion of the contracted soft tissue envelope, creating adequate space for the newly reconstructed nasal framework. One patient developed exposure of the tissue expander through the endonasal incision, which did not lead to any adverse outcome. All patients in this series tolerated expansion well, without complaints of pain or external skin breakdown. The use of soft tissue expanders along the nasal dorsum can successfully expand contracted and scarred soft tissue envelopes prior to reconstructive rhinoplasty. This technique may be an effective alternative to the use of interpolated flaps in treating these patients.",Contemporary Trends in the Surgical Management of Nasal Septal Perforations: A Community Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566987,Facial plastic surgery : FPS,2019 06 06,"There currently exists an overabundance of publications advocating different septal perforation repair methods. The objective of this article was to examine the preponderance of techniques and trends in the surgical management of septal perforations in the practices of otolaryngologists, rhinologists, and facial plastic surgeons. The study was designed as a multicenter cross-sectional survey. The participants were members of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the American Rhinologic Society. Septal perforation closure rates and perforation repair approach, technique, and interposition graft material preferences were the main outcomes. A total of 320 respondents completed the survey, of whom 75% performed perforation repairs. The success rates in closing perforations < 1 cm, 1-2 cm, and > 2 cm were 84%, 64%, and 31%, respectively. The respondents had a similar preference for the endoscopic (52%) and external rhinoplasty (49%) approaches, followed by the endonasal approach (43%). Bilateral intranasal mucosal advancement flaps (79%) and unilateral intranasal mucosal rotational or advancement flaps (60%) were the favored repair techniques. Most respondents (84%) incorporated an interposition graft and intranasal splints (89%) for the repair, and the most popular interposition graft material was acellular dermis (63%). The self-reported perforation closure success rates in this survey were lower than those published in the literature, a phenomenon possibly explained by the premise that surgeons with favorable outcomes are more apt to share their results. The preferred surgical approach was evenly distributed between the external rhinoplasty and endoscopic approaches and influenced by a surgeon's training, perforation size and location, and the need for concomitant rhinoplasty. This study is the first to characterize contemporary community trends in the surgical closure of septal perforations and demonstrates that while preference for perforation repair approach among the respondents varied, surgeons favored septal perforation repair using bilateral intranasal mucosal advancement flaps with an interposition graft.",Prevalence and Predictive Factors of Histopathological Complications in Children with Esophageal Atresia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566986,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Questionnaire-based data were supplemented with routine information from the databases of pension insurances. Descriptive statistics were done separately for the 4 main diagnoses (mental illness, neoplasms, musculoskeletal diseases, diseases of circulatory system). Testing for group differences was performed by ANOVA or chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 3,880 participants were included in the analyses. At the end of their first period of approval, these TDP still reported overall impaired health. While receiving pension, 36.8% of TDP with mental illness received medical rehabilitation. Employment participation benefits were granted more often to pensioners with musculoskeletal diseases (8.1%). About one-third of the participants would like to RTW. The individual work capacity and possibility of finding a matching job were rated more pessimistically. TDP with neoplasms tended to report better health condition and attitude towards RTW than the other diagnosis groups.

Despite their importance for clinical outcome, there is no consensus on the most effective monitoring strategies. This review describes the current state of knowledge focusing on antiplatelet therapy monitoring in children. The authors searched five databases (PubMed-NCBI, MEDLINE-OVID, SCOPUS-Elsevier, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane) from January 2000 to October 2017 using keywords selected a priori. Identified articles were sorted according to the antiplatelet agents administered, methods of antiplatelet monitoring, and outcome measures. Twenty studies were included, with 14 cohort studies, 3 randomized controlled trials, and 3 cross-sectional studies. Eleven different antiplatelet monitoring tools were used, with the most common being Light Transmission Aggregometry, Urinary Thromboxane, Thromboelastography with Platelet Mapping, and VerifyNow. In the majority of studies, antiplatelet therapy monitoring was used to describe adequacy or responsiveness to treatment based on laboratory cut-off values, which were not uniform and sourced from adult studies or extrapolated from test manuals. Several studies evaluated monitoring related to clinical outcome or adjusted therapy to reach predefined therapeutic targets. There was no single laboratory method found to be distinctly better for monitoring antiplatelet treatment. Associations between laboratory assays and clinical outcomes or assays and gold standard measurements were highly inconsistent.

The authors developed a novel, miniaturized device utilizing surface acoustic waves (SAW) to detect clotting, and used it to develop a novel universal microfluidic coagulation test. Results from this assay were compared with results from standard coagulation assays to detect classical anticoagulants (unfractionated heparin, argatroban) and direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban). The SAW-clotting time (SAW-CT) of this novel device was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner for heparin, argatroban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, comparable to standard assays. The authors confirmed the clinical utility of this device in a small patient population admitted to a stroke unit. Preliminary clinical data prove the suitability of the SAW-CT in patients receiving warfarin, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran.

Measurement of activity, however, may be important in patients with major and life-threatening bleeding, patients needing emergent surgery, in reversal situations, or in patients at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis due to underlying conditions. For these patients, a widely available and rapid turnaround assay would be optimal. To date, there is no such assay available, especially for the direct factor Xa inhibitors. This report describes the performance of a new, rapid turnaround, point-of-care (PoC) assay for measuring the activity of a range of anticoagulants, including DOACs and heparins, in emergency situations and for routine measurement in high-risk patients. Perosphere Technologies' PoC coagulometer is a handheld instrument that performs individual coagulation tests on samples of fresh whole blood (∼10 µL) with clotting activated by glass contact and endpoint determination performed by infrared spectroscopy. In preclinical studies using rats anticoagulated with therapeutic doses of edoxaban or enoxaparin, the PoC coagulometer showed a strong linear correlation between pharmacokinetic parameters and clotting time with edoxaban (r2 = 0.994) and with enoxaparin (r2 = 0.967). These preclinical results suggest that this PoC coagulometer would be ideal to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of anticoagulants and their reversal agents. The PoC bedside instrument delivers results within minutes and requires no more than a drop of whole blood. Studies are underway to confirm these results in humans and to further characterize the performance of the instrument.","Meeting Report: The XXVth Slovak-Czech Conference on Hemostasis and Thrombosis (with International Participation), Martin, Slovak Republic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566965,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 03 20,,"Identifying, Analyzing, and Visualizing Diagnostic Paths for Patients with Nonspecific Abdominal Pain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566964,Applied clinical informatics,2019 06 11,"Diagnosis is complex, uncertain, and error-prone.

Cucurbitacin B (CuB) is a natural compound isolated from herbs and shows anticancer activity in several cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Here, we analyzed the eﬀects of diﬀerent CuB concentrations on the proliferative and invasive behaviors of CRC cells using MTT, clonogenic assay, Transwell invasion, and wound healing assays. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the apoptotic eﬀects of CuB on CRC cells. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to investigate the expression of apoptosis and Hippo-YAP signaling pathway proteins. RESULTS CuB inhibited the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells while promoting apoptosis. In addition, the Western blot and real-time PCR results indicated that CuB suppressed YAP expression and its downstream target genes Cyr 61 and c-Myc in CRC cells. To assess the underlying mechanism, we investigated the upstream regulating factor LATS1, and the results revealed that CuB upregulated LATS1 expression in CRC cells. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our findings uncovered a novel therapeutic mechanism of CuB and suggest that there is therapeutic potential and feasibility in developing novel YAP inhibitors for cancer treatment.",A Promising New Approach for the Treatment of Inflammatory Pain: Transfer of Stem Cell-Derived Tyrosine Hydroxylase-Positive Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566959,Neuroimmunomodulation,2019 06 15,"The appearance of endogenous tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells (TH+ cells) in collagen-induced arthritis was associated with an anti-inflammatory effect.

Rhodococcus sp. P14 was isolated from sediments with crude oil contaminate and showed degradation ability on various PAHs. The genome of Rhodococcus sp. P14 was sequenced. A gene cluster encoding a ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase Baa related to PAH degradation was identified by bioinformatics. The expression level of gene baaA was increased when P14 was cultured with anthracene, pyrene, phenanthrene, or benz[a]-anthracene as the single carbon source. The recombinant protein Baa was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Further investigations on the recombinant protein Baa in E. coli demonstrated that it was able to oxidize anthracene and benz [a]anthracene, resulting in 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene and 7, 12-dihydroxybenz[a]anthracene as metabolites, respectively. These results indicate that Baa plays an important role in PAH degradation in Rhodococcus sp. P14 and Baa has potential application in the bioremediation of PAHs in the contaminated environment."

Body plans are specified by a conserved group of homeobox-containing genes (Hox genes), which encode transcription factors important in cell fate and vertebral architecture along the anteroposterior axis during embryonic development; thus, dysregulation of these genes may cause congenital malformations, from mild-sublethal to embryonic-lethal. The genetic pool, maternal transfer, and environmental conditions during egg incubation affect development; environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, oxygen, and pollution may alter gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, in this review, we present information regarding Hox genes and development in reptiles, including sex determination and teratogenesis. We also present some evidence of epigenetic regulation of Hox genes and the role of the environment in epigenetic modulation of gene expression. So far, the evidence suggests that the molecular instructions encoded by Hox genes to build a snake, a lizard, or a turtle represent the interplay between genome and epigenome after years of evolution, with occasional environmentally induced molecular mistakes leading to abnormal body shapes.",Changes in and Interactions between Physical and Mental Health in Older Japanese: The Nakanojo Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566936,Gerontology,2019 03 28,"An age-related decrease in functional capacity is consistently reported, but it is not consistently related to a worsening of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) or psychological adjustment.

In addition, comparative investigations across species are also expected to be conducted under similar physical environment (such as the main magnetic field strength, RF pulse shape, sequence protocols, gradient waveform, system stability, etc in MRI), in order to avoid possible deviation in signal detection under different platforms, as well as to reduce experiment complexity. We have proposed a novel 5-channel surface coil that is equipped on 7T human MRI scanners and designed for small animal structural and functional MRI. Through a series of in vivo experiments over an anesthetized rat and macaque, the presented coil shows its main characteristics in, i.e. flexible coil mounting, reduced FOV, high temporal SNR, and parallel imaging capability. Such design is able to compensate the relatively lower gradient slew rate of human scanners versus those with smaller bores, and thus effectively facilitates in vivo microscopic structural MR images being obtained within a shortened and safe period of anesthesia; besides, it also enables high-resolution functional MRI (i.e. spin-echo based) being achieved with reasonable temporal resolution, distortion level and functional contrast.",Detection of the focal spot motion relative to the collimator axis of a linear accelerator under gantry rotation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566917,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 01 31,"The potential for delivering high precision radiotherapy using linear accelerators (linacs) has been improved with the development of digital x-ray electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) for acquiring kilovoltage (kV) cone-beam CT and megavoltage (MV) images for patient positioning.

The aim of this work was to measure the offset of the focal spot position (FSP) of a linac under gantry rotation relative to the collimator axis using an EPID. The focal spot was assumed to be a point source of MV x-ray generation. A special phantom was designed for measurement of FSP as a function of gantry angle on clinical linacs. The phantom was designed for attachment to the gantry head and supporting two tungsten-carbide ball-bearings at two different distances from the focal spot. The methodology was demonstrated on a series of images acquired of the phantom on three Elekta linacs in clinical use with 6 MV flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams. The gantry and collimator were rotated 360° in steps of 30°. For each position an image of the phantom was acquired using the EPID. Each series consisted of 169 EPID images. The images were analysed using in-house developed software. Analyses of the EPID images acquired with 6 MV FFF beams showed that the focal spot motion amplitudes relative to the collimator axis during gantry rotation in the longitudinal and lateral directions were less than 0.10 mm and 0.50 mm, respectively, for an optimized 6 MV FFF FSP calibrated linac.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 01 28,"We report on the low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) study of the (Bi, Na)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] reconstruction that is known to possess Fermi surface with apparently good nesting. We found that defects on this surface produce a one-dimensional-like pattern with the periodicity of 8.2 [Formula: see text] 0.4 [Formula: see text] that is incommensurate with the [Formula: see text] lattice period. The [Formula: see text] mapping analysis reveals an occurrence of the k-dependent branch associated with quasi-particle interference and the k-independent branch associated with the nesting vector connecting the parallel segments of the (Bi,Na)/Si(1 1 1)[Formula: see text] Fermi surface, the fingerprint of the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. The STS data demonstrates that development of the CDW phase leads to reducing electron density of states at the Fermi level.",Implementation and validation of time-of-flight PET image reconstruction module for listmode and sinogram projection data in the STIR library.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566915,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 01 22,"In this paper, we describe the implementation of support for time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET) for both listmode and sinogram data in the open source software for tomographic image reconstruction (STIR). We provide validation and performance characterization using simulated data from the open source GATE Monte Carlo toolbox, with TOF configurations spanning from 81.2 to 209.6 ps. The coincidence detector resolution was corrected for the timing resolution deterioration due to the contribution of the crystal length. Comparison between the reconstruction of listmode and sinogram data demonstrated good agreement in both TOF and non-TOF cases in terms of relative absolute error. To reduce the reconstruction time, we assessed the truncation of the TOF kernel along lines-of-response (LOR). Rejection of LOR elements beyond four times the TOF standard deviation provides significant acceleration of [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] without compromising the image quality. Further narrowing of the kernel can provide extra time reduction but with the gradual introduction of error in the reconstructed images. As expected, TOF reconstruction performs better than non-TOF in terms of both contrast-recovery-coefficient (CRC) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). CRC achieves convergence faster with TOF, at lower noise levels. SNR with TOF was superior for early iterations, but with quick deterioration. Higher timing resolution further improved reconstruction performance, while TOF bin mashing was shown to have only a small impact on reconstructed images.","Diagnosing complex regional pain syndrome using an electronic nose, a pilot study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566914,Journal of breath research,2019 04 16,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a complication after surgery or trauma and is characterized by a continuing regional pain in a distal extremity. The pain is disproportionate in severity and duration in relation to the preceding trauma. Currently, the diagnosis is based on the patients' signs and symptoms. There is no objective clinically applicable test available to confirm the diagnosis of CRPS, however this could contribute to a more reliable and valid diagnosis. Since the treatment of CRPS differs from that of other types of pain this could thereby lead to earlier and (more) appropriate treatment and possibly to lower medical costs. The Aeonose™ is a diagnostic test device which detects volatile organic profiles in exhaled air. Exhaled breath analysis using an electronic nose has been successfully applied to differentiate between sick and healthy persons for various indications. This study was a feasibility study in which we investigated whether the Aeonose™ is able to measure a difference in the volatome of CRPS patients compared to the volatome of healthy controls.",A novel phantom for characterization of dual energy imaging using an on-board imaging system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566913,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 01 21,"Dual-energy (DE) imaging using planar imaging with an on-board imager (OBI) is being considered in radiotherapy. We describe here a custom phantom designed to optimize DE imaging parameters using the OBI of a commercial linear accelerator. The phantom was constructed of lung-, tissue- and bone-equivalent material slabs. Five simulated tumors located at two different depths were encased in the lung-equivalent materials. Two slabs with bone-equivalent material inserts were constructed to simulate ribs, which overlap the simulated tumors. DE bone suppression was performed using a weighted logarithmic subtraction based on an iterative method that minimized the contrast between simulated bone- and lung-equivalent materials. The phantom was subsequently used to evaluate different combinations of high-low kV x-ray pairs of images based on the signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) metric. The results show a strong correlation between tumor visibility and selected energy pairs, where higher energy separation leads to larger SDNR values. To evaluate the effect of image post-processing methods on tumor visibility, an anti-correlated noise reduction (ACNR) technique and adaptive kernel scatter correction method were applied to subsequent DE images. Application of the ACNR technique approximately doubled the SDNR values, hence increasing tumor visibility, while scatter correction had little effect on SDNR values. This phantom allows for quick image acquisition and optimization of imaging parameters and weighting factors. Optimized DE imaging increases soft tissue visibility and may allow for markerless motion tracking of lung tumors.","Home monitoring of sleep with a temporary-tattoo EEG, EOG and EMG electrode array: a feasibility study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566912,Journal of neural engineering,2019 03 13,"Circadian and sleep dysfunction have long been symptomatic hallmarks of a variety of devastating neurodegenerative conditions. The gold standard for sleep monitoring is overnight sleep in a polysomnography (PSG) laboratory. However, this method has several limitations such as availability, cost and being labour-intensive. In recent years there has been a heightened interest in home-based sleep monitoring via wearable sensors. Our objective was to demonstrate the use of printed electrode technology as a novel platform for sleep monitoring.",Tunable MoS2 modified hybrid surface plasmon waveguides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566911,Nanotechnology,2019 02 15,"The tunable propagation properties of MoS2 supported hybrid surface plasmon waveguides based on dielectric fiber-gap-metal substrate structures have been investigated by using the finite element method, including the effects of structural parameters, the dielectric fiber shape and carrier concentration of the MoS2 layer. The results reveal that as the dielectric fiber radius increases, the confinement of the hybrid mode increases, and the losses show a peak. The shape of the dielectric fiber affects the propagation properties obviously, with an optimum structural parameter (a large value of the elliptical parameter) the confinement and figure of merits increase, and the dissipation decreases simultaneously. In addition, as the carrier concentration of the MoS2 layer increases, the modulation depth of absorption reaches more than 40%, and the propagation constants manifest obvious double peaks at wavelengths of 610 nm (2.03 eV) and 660 nm (1.88 eV), coming from the excitons' absorption of the MoS2 layer. The results are very useful in helping one to understand the tunable mechanisms of hybrid mode waveguide structures and for the design of novel surface plasmonic devices in the future, e.g. absorbers, modulators, lasers, and resonators.",Pressure induced transformation and subsequent amorphization of monoclinic Nb2O5 and its effect on optical properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566910,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 01 23,"Pressure-induced phase transitions of monoclinic H-Nb2O5 have been studied by in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and Raman and optical transmission spectroscopy. The initial monoclinic phase is found to transform into an orthorhombic phase at ~9 GPa and then change to an amorphous form above 21.4 GPa. The PDF data reveal that the amorphization is associated with disruptions of the long-range order of the NbO6 octahedra and the NbO7 pentagonal bipyramids, whereas the local edge-shares of octahedra and the local linkages of pentagonal bipyramids are largely preserved in their nearest neighbors. Upon compression, the transmittance of the sample in a region from visible to near infrared (450-1000 nm) starts to increase above 8.0 GPa and displays a dramatic enhancement above 22.2 GPa, indicating that the amorphous form has a high transmittance. The pressure-induced amorphous form is found to be recoverable under pressure release, and maintain high optical transmittance property at ambient conditions. The recoverable pressure induced amorphous material promises for applications in multifunctional materials.","Quantum fluctuation in thermopower at the topological phase transition in CaSrX (X: Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) studied from first principles theory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566909,Journal of physics.

CaSrSi and CaSrGe evolved as normal semiconductors with uni-axial strain. The trivial and non-trivial topological phases are evaluated by band inversion and Z 2 topological invariants. A comprehensive analysis of thermopower, electrical conductivity scaled by relaxation time at these Dirac semi-metallic states exposes the highly oscillating behaviour, which gives insight to quantum oscillations driven by uni-axial strain. Further the thermoelectric properties at strong topological insulating states and normal insulating states have been summarized, which reveals the potential thermoelectric properties of these materials."

Its etiology remains unknown. Several risk factors have been identified with generalized tonic-clonic seizures as the most important one; seizure control remains the most effective measure of prevention. Although some cases may be attributable to cardiac causes, mainly undiagnosed cardiac channelopathies, the majority appear linked to epilepsy-related disruption of the functional connectivity of certain brain structures associated with the central autonomic control of cardio-respiratory function (neuro-cardio-respiratory connection). Obtaining further data on its pathophysiologic mechanisms is a cardinal step towards preventing and reducing the incidence of SUDEP. Neuroimaging and molecular genetic studies may provide insights into the causes of SUDEP and identify potential biomarkers for risk stratification of patients susceptible to SUDEP.

It is known that 5-15μm thick sections can be prepared with the cutting-grinding technique, but their production causes a high material loss (≥0.5mm) between two sections and requires years of training and experience. With the development of the laser microtome it has become possible to cut decalcified bone without high sample material loss. Many scientific publications deal with the application possibilities of the individual methods So far, there is no comparison work between the cutting-grinding technique and laser microtomy. For this reason, new tissue sections were prepared by laser microtome and analyzed histologically from samples that had been previously been prepared by the cutting-grinding technique. Using both methods, it could be demonstrated that the different implants were completely surrounded by a connective tissue layer. In sections (50-100μm) produced by the routine cutting-grinding technique, magnifications up to 20× revealed no detailed histological information because cell structures could not be clearly identified. By contrast, laser microtome sections (10μm) revealed these information as e.g. osteocytes are already clearly visible at 10× magnification. Furthermore, the interface between implant and the surrounding bone could be clearly demonstrated due to visible demarcation between a capsule and connective tissue. At the histological level, laser microtome sections were clearly superior at thicknesses ≥30μm compared to sections produced by the cutting-grinding technique. In addition, laser microtomy has the advantages of time saving and markedly reduced sample loss, especially in cases of the production of serial sections.",Ontogeny of calcium-binding proteins in the cingulate cortex of the guinea pig: The same onset but different developmental patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566895,Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,2019 06 13,"This paper compared the density of calbindin D28k (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) containing neurons in prenatal, newborn and postnatal periods in the cingulate cortex (CC) of the guinea pig as an animal model. The distribution and co-distribution among calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) was also investigated during the entire ontogeny. The study found that CB-positive neurons exhibited the highest density in the developing CC. The CC development in the prenatal period took place with a high level of CB and CR immunoreactivity and both of these proteins reached peak density during fetal life. The density of PV-positive neurons, in contrast to CB and CR-positive neurons, reached high levels postnatally. The observed changes of the CaBPs-positive neuron density in the developing CC coincide with developmental events in the guinea pig. E.g. the eyes opening moment may be preceded by elevated levels of CB and CR at E50, whereas high immunoreactivity of PV from P10 to P40 with a peak at P20 may indicate the participation of PV in enhancement of the inhibitory cortical pathway maturation.",Correlation of melanoma gene expression score with clinical outcomes on a series of melanocytic lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566894,Human pathology,2019 04 16,"A 23-gene expression signature was recently developed as an adjunct to histopathology to differentiate melanocytic nevi from melanoma. The current study correlated the gene expression signature scores to actual clinical outcomes in cases from the first validation study. RNA was extracted from 127 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of melanocytic lesions. Gene expression was measured using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and a weighting algorithm was used to generate a numeric score. Gene expression test results were compared to histopathological diagnoses and development of local recurrence, sentinel lymph node metastases, and distant metastases. Sixty-five lesions were diagnosed histopathologically as melanoma. Fourteen developed metastases. Gene expression test results were malignant in 61 of 65 (93.8%) lesions (including all lesions that metastasized), indeterminate in 2 of 65 (3.1%) lesions, and benign in 2 of 65 (3.1%) lesions.

E-cadherin is the key organizer of the epithelial cell barrier, and it is required at the cell surface to preserve epithelial tissue integrity and homeostasis, since it not only organizes the adherens junctions, but also transfers intracellular signals that provide cues to regulate cell survival, morphology and polarity. As such, de-regulation of E-cadherin has deleterious effects on cells and whole tissues. The availability of cadherin at the cellular junctions is determined by the rates of new protein synthesis and degradation, as well as of internalization and recycling. Indeed, E-cadherin is subjected to a constant and a signal-mediated turnover due to trafficking and recycling between the cell surface and the cytoplasm. Importantly, the turnover of E-cadherin is required for both cell adhesion and cell plasticity within a tissue. Understanding the pathways and molecular mechanisms that E-cadherin undertakes to move in and out of adherens junctions, through which epithelial cells communicate with each other, has, thus, been a major research focus over the past decade, but several issues remain unresolved. Here, we review major advances and remaining open questions in the understanding of E-cadherin trafficking, with a particular focus on its ubiquitination.",RNA interference screen identifies NAA10 as a regulator of PXR transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566892,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 02 05,"The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a principal xenobiotic receptor crucial in the detection, detoxification, and clearance of toxic substances from the body. PXR plays a vital role in the metabolism and disposition of drugs, and elevated PXR levels contribute to cancer drug resistance. Therefore, to modulate PXR activity and mitigate drug resistance, it is imperative to fully understand its regulation. To this end, we screened a transcription factor siRNA library in pancreatic cancer cells that express high levels of PXR. Through a comprehensive deconvolution process, we identified N-alpha-acetyltransferase 10 (NAA10) as a factor in the transcriptional machinery regulating PXR transcription. Because no one single factor has 100% operational control of PXR transcriptional regulation, our results together with other previous findings suggest that the transcriptional regulation of PXR is complex and that multiple factors contribute to the process including NAA10.","Incidence, predictors, causes, and costs of 30-day readmission after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566891,Resuscitation,2019 02 16,Readmissions after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ICPR) are common and contribute to increased health care utilization and costs.

Size control is typically studied at specific cell cycle transitions that are delayed or accelerated depending on size. This focus is well suited for revealing mechanisms acting at these transitions, but neglects the dynamics in other cell cycle phases, and is therefore inherently limited for studying how the characteristic cell size is determined. We address this limitation through a formalism that intuitively visualizes the characteristic size emerging from integrated cell cycle dynamics of individual cells. Applying this formalism to budding yeast, we describe the contributions of the un-budded (G1) and budded (S-G2-M) phase to size adjustments following environmental or genetic perturbations. We show that although the budded phase can be perturbed with little consequences for G1 dynamics, perturbations in G1 propagate to the budded phase.

We use single-cell gene profiling to analyze the molecular heterogeneity in basal and luminal compartments. Within the luminal compartment, we identify a subset of cells intrinsically resistant to castration with a bi-lineage gene expression pattern. We discover LY6D as a marker of CR prostate progenitors with multipotent differentiation and enriched organoid-forming capacity. Lineage tracing further reveals that LY6D+ CR luminal cells can produce LY6D- luminal cells. In contrast, in luminal cells lacking PTEN, LY6D+ cells predominantly give rise to LY6D+ tumor cells, contributing to high-grade PIN lesions. Gene expression analyses in patients' biopsies indicate that LY6D expression correlates with early disease progression, including progression to CRPC. Our studies thus identify a subpopulation of luminal progenitors characterized by LY6D expression and intrinsic castration resistance. LY6D may serve as a prognostic maker for advanced prostate cancer.",Casein Kinase II Phosphorylation of Spt6 Enforces Transcriptional Fidelity by Maintaining Spn1-Spt6 Interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566871,Cell reports,2019 01 30,"Spt6 is a histone chaperone that associates with RNA polymerase II and deposits nucleosomes in the wake of transcription. Although Spt6 has an essential function in nucleosome deposition, it is not known whether this function is influenced by post-translational modification. Here, we report that casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation of Spt6 is required for nucleosome occupancy at the 5' ends of genes to prevent aberrant antisense transcription and enforce transcriptional directionality. Mechanistically, we show that CKII phosphorylation of Spt6 promotes the interaction of Spt6 with Spn1, a binding partner required for chromatin reassembly and full recruitment of Spt6 to genes. Our study defines a function for CKII phosphorylation in transcription and highlights the importance of post-translational modification in histone chaperone function.",Allosteric Regulation of NCLX by Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Links the Metabolic State and Ca2+ Signaling in Mitochondria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566870,Cell reports,2018 12 19,"Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function under both normal and pathological conditions. The mechanisms linking metabolic activity to mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling remain elusive, however. Here, by monitoring mitochondrial Ca2+ transients while manipulating mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), we found that mild fluctuations in ΔΨm, which do not affect Ca2+ influx, are sufficient to strongly regulate NCLX, the major efflux pathway of Ca2+ from the mitochondria. Phosphorylation of NCLX or expression of phosphomimicking mutant (S258D) rescued NCLX activity from ΔΨm-driven allosteric inhibition. By screening ΔΨm sensitivity of NCLX mutants, we also identified amino acid residues that, through functional interaction with Ser258, control NCLX regulation. Finally, we find that glucose-driven ΔΨm changes in pancreatic β-cells control mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling primarily via NCLX regulation. Our results identify a feedback control between metabolic activity and mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and the ""safety valve"" NCLX phosphorylation that can rescue Ca2+ efflux in depolarized mitochondria.",Clustered Ca2+ Channels Are Blocked by Synaptic Vesicle Proton Release at Mammalian Auditory Ribbon Synapses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566869,Cell reports,2019 02 08,"A Ca2+ current transient block (ICaTB) by protons occurs at some ribbon-type synapses after exocytosis, but this has not been observed at mammalian hair cells. Here we show that a robust ICaTB occurs at post-hearing mouse and gerbil inner hair cell (IHC) synapses, but not in immature IHC synapses, which contain non-compact active zones, where Ca2+ channels are loosely coupled to the release sites. Unlike ICaTB at other ribbon synapses, ICaTB in mammalian IHCs displays a surprising multi-peak structure that mirrors the EPSCs seen in paired recordings. Desynchronizing vesicular release with intracellular BAPTA or by deleting otoferlin, the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, greatly reduces ICaTB, whereas enhancing release synchronization by raising Ca2+ influx or temperature increases ICaTB. This suggests that ICaTB is produced by fast multivesicular proton-release events. We propose that ICaTB may function as a submillisecond feedback mechanism contributing to the auditory nerve's fast spike adaptation during sound stimulation.",Paired Related Homeobox Protein 1 Regulates Quiescence in Human Oligodendrocyte Progenitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566868,Cell reports,2019 01 30,"Human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs) persist into adulthood as an abundant precursor population capable of division and differentiation. The transcriptional mechanisms that regulate hOPC homeostasis remain poorly defined. Herein, we identify paired related homeobox protein 1 (PRRX1) in primary PDGFαR+ hOPCs. We show that enforced PRRX1 expression results in reversible G1/0 arrest. While both PRRX1 splice variants reduce hOPC proliferation, only PRRX1a abrogates migration. hOPC engraftment into hypomyelinated shiverer/rag2 mouse brain is severely impaired by PRRX1a, characterized by reduced cell proliferation and migration. PRRX1 induces a gene expression signature characteristic of stem cell quiescence. Both IFN-γ and BMP signaling upregulate PRRX1 and induce quiescence. PRRX1 knockdown modulates IFN-γ-induced quiescence. In mouse brain, PRRX1 mRNA was detected in non-dividing OPCs and is upregulated in OPCs following demyelination. Together, these data identify PRRX1 as a regulator of quiescence in hOPCs and as a potential regulator of pathological quiescence.",An Integrative Study of Protein-RNA Condensates Identifies Scaffolding RNAs and Reveals Players in Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566867,Cell reports,2019 01 09,"Recent evidence indicates that specific RNAs promote the formation of ribonucleoprotein condensates by acting as scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).

Mechanistically, astin C specifically blocks the recruitment of IRF3 onto the STING signalosome. Collectively, this study characterizes a STING-specific small-molecular inhibitor that may be applied for potentially manipulating the STING-mediated clinical diseases.",Methyltransferase Nsd2 Ensures Germinal Center Selection by Promoting Adhesive Interactions between B Cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566865,Cell reports,2018 12 19,"Antibody affinity maturation, which is an antigen-based selection process for B cells, occurs in germinal centers (GCs). GCB cells must efficiently recognize, acquire, and present antigens from follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) to receive positive selection signals from T helper cells. Previous studies showed that GCB cells undergo adhesive interactions with FDCs, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the cell adhesions and their functional relevance remain unclear. Here, we identified H3K36me2 methyltransferase Nsd2 as a critical regulator of GCB cell-FDC adhesion. Nsd2 deletion modestly reduced GC responses but strongly impaired B cell affinity maturation. Mechanistically, Nsd2 directly regulated expression of multiple actin polymerization-related genes in GCB cells. Nsd2 loss reduced B cell adhesion to FDC-expressed adhesion molecules, thus affecting both B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and antigen acquisition. Overall, Nsd2 coordinates GCB positive selection by enhancing both BCR signaling and T cell help.",An mRNA Vaccine Protects Mice against Multiple Tick-Transmitted Flavivirus Infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566864,Cell reports,2019 02 02,"Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-transmitted flavivirus that circulates in North America and Russia. Up to 5% of deer ticks now test positive for POWV in certain regions of the northern United States. Although POWV infections cause life-threatening encephalitis, there is no vaccine or countermeasure available for prevention or treatment. Here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding the POWV prM and E genes and demonstrated its immunogenicity and efficacy in mice following immunization with one or two doses. The POWV mRNA vaccine induced high titers of neutralizing antibody and sterilizing immunity against lethal challenge with different POWV strains. The mRNA vaccine also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple other tick-borne flaviviruses and protected mice against the distantly related Langat virus. These data demonstrate the utility of the LNP-mRNA vaccine platform for the development of vaccines with protective activity against multiple flaviviruses."

How cellular dynamics sustain neurogenesis and how alterations with age may result in this decline are unresolved issues. We therefore clonally traced NSC lineages using confetti reporters in young and middle-aged adult mice. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we derived mathematical models that explain observed clonal cell type abundances. The best models consistently show self-renewal of transit-amplifying progenitors and rapid neuroblast cell cycle exit. In middle-aged mice, we identified an increased probability of asymmetric stem cell divisions at the expense of symmetric differentiation, accompanied by an extended persistence of quiescence between activation phases. Our model explains existing longitudinal population data and identifies particular cellular properties underlying adult NSC homeostasis and the aging of this stem cell compartment.","Agreement between gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men's period prevalence and event-level recall of sexual behaviour: an observational respondent-driven sampling study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566851,Sexual health,2019 05 01,"Background Agreement between sexual behaviour recall measures among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM) in Vancouver, Canada was examined.",Knowing our patients: a cross-sectional study of adult patients attending an urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary healthcare service.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566850,Australian journal of primary health,2018 12 19,"Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in urban areas, but epidemiological data about their health status and health needs are lacking. This knowledge is critical to informing and evaluating initiatives to improve service delivery and health outcomes. One potential data source is de-identified routinely collected clinical data. This cross-sectional study, conducted in an urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary healthcare service, involved randomly selecting a sample of 400 patients aged ≥15 years, and manually extracting electronic health record data. In the sample, 49% of patients were aged <35 years, 56% were female and 38% were employed. Overall, 56% of females and 47% of males aged 35-54 years had depression, 26% had experienced a bereavement within the last 12 months, and while 44% were alcohol abstainers, 35% were drinking at high-risk levels. The present study cannot demonstrate causal relationships between the observed high rates of chronic disease in older people and frequent experiences of bereavement and high levels of mental ill health in young- and middle-aged adults. However, a life course approach provides a framework to understand the interconnectedness of these results, and suggests that strategies to blunt the intergenerational burden of chronic disease need to address the social and emotional wellbeing of youth.","A Set of Conventional and Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assays for Direct Detection of Elsinoë fawcettii, E. australis, and Pseudocercospora angolensis in Citrus Fruits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566843,Plant disease,2019 03 22,"Elsinoë fawcettii, E. australis, and Pseudocercospora angolensis are causal agents of citrus scab and spot diseases. The three pathogens are listed as quarantine pests in many countries and are subject to phytosanitary measures to prevent their entry. Diagnosis of these diseases based on visual symptoms is problematic, as they could be confused with other citrus diseases. Isolation of E. fawcettii, E. australis, and P. angolensis from infected tissues is challenging because they grow slowly on culture media. This study developed rapid and specific detection tools for the in planta detection of these pathogens, using either conventional PCR or one-tube multiplex real-time PCR. Primers and hybridization probes were designed to target the single-copy protein-coding gene MS204 for E. fawcettii and E. australis and the translation elongation factor (Tef-1α) gene for P. angolensis. The specificity of the assays was evaluated by testing against DNA extracted from a large number of isolates (102) collected from different citrus-growing areas in the world and from other hosts. The newly described species E. citricola was not included in the specificity test due to its unavailability from the CBS collection. The detection limits of conventional PCR for the three pathogens were 100, 100, and 10 pg μl-1 gDNA per reaction for E. fawcettii, E. australis, and P. angolensis, respectively. The quadruplex qPCR was fully validated assessing the following performance criteria: sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and robustness. The quadruplex real-time PCR proved to be highly sensitive, detecting as low as 243, 241, and 242 plasmidic copies (pc) μl-1 of E. fawcettii, E. australis, and P. angolensis, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of this quadruplex assay were further confirmed using 176 naturally infected citrus samples collected from Ethiopia, Cameroon, the United States, and Australia. The quadruplex assay developed in this study is robust, cost-effective, and capable of high-throughput detection of the three targets directly from citrus samples. This new detection tool will substantially reduce the turnaround time for reliable species identification and allow rapid response and appropriate action.",Direct Probe of the Seebeck Coefficient in a Kondo-Correlated Single-Quantum-Dot Transistor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566839,Nano letters,2019 05 29,"We report on the first measurement of the Seebeck coefficient in a tunnel-contacted and gate-tunable individual single-quantum dot junction in the Kondo regime, fabricated using the electromigration technique. This fundamental thermoelectric parameter is obtained by directly monitoring the magnitude of the voltage induced in response to a temperature difference across the junction, while keeping a zero net tunneling current through the device. In contrast to bulk materials and single molecules probed in a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) configuration, investigating the thermopower in nanoscale electronic transistors benefits from the electric tunability to showcase prominent quantum effects. Here, striking sign changes of the Seebeck coefficient are induced by varying the temperature, depending on the spin configuration in the quantum dot. The comparison with numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations demonstrates that the tunneling density of states is generically asymmetric around the Fermi level in the leads, both in the cotunneling and Kondo regimes.",Forging C(sp3)-C(sp3) Bonds with Carbon-Centered Radicals in the Synthesis of Complex Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566838,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 14,"Radical fragment coupling reactions that unite intricate subunits have become an important class of transformations within the arena of complex molecule synthesis.

Proteins that are truly only marginally stable, those with a low free energy of unfolding, exist as an equilibrium mixture of folded and unfolded forms under ""normal"" conditions. To some extent such proteins have some features in common with ""intrinsically disordered"" proteins. We analyzed the relationship between these marginally stable proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins in order to fully understand the twilight zone that distinguishes the two ensembles in the hope of clarifying the fuzzy borders of the current classification that divides the protein world into folded and intrinsically disordered ones. Our analysis suggests that the division may be too drastic and misleading, because it puts within the same category proteins with very different behaviors. We propose a restricted, albeit operational, definition of ""marginally stable proteins"", referring by this term only to proteins whose free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states falls in the interval 0-3 kcal/mol. These proteins have special features because they normally exist as equilibrium mixtures of folded and unfolded species or as molten globule states. This coexistence makes marginally stable proteins ideal tools to study even small environmental changes to which they may behave as natural sensors.",Compound-Specific Carbon Isotopic Composition of Ethanol in Brazil and US Vehicle Emissions and Wet Deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566835,Environmental science & technology,2019 02 05,"Global atmospheric ethanol budget models include large uncertainties in the magnitude of ethanol emission sources and sinks. To apply stable isotope techniques to constrain ethanol emission sources, a headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatograph-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry method (HS-SPME-GC-C-IRMS) was developed to measure the carbon isotopic composition of aqueous phase ethanol at natural abundance levels (1-30 μM) with a precision of 0.4‰. The method was applied to determine the carbon isotope signatures (δ13C) of vehicle ethanol emission sources in Brazil (-12.8 ± 2.4‰) and the US (-9.8 ± 2.5‰), and to measure the carbon isotope composition of ethanol in wet deposition (-22.6 to -12.7‰). A two end-member isotope mixing model was developed using anthropogenic and biogenic end members and fractionation scenarios to estimate ethanol source contributions to wet deposition collected in Brazil and US. Mixing model results indicate anthropogenic sources contribute two and a half to four times more ethanol to the atmosphere than previously predicted in modeled global ethanol inventories. As established and developing countries continue to rapidly increase ethanol fuel consumption and subsequent emissions, understanding the magnitude of all ethanol sources and sinks will be essential for modeling future atmospheric chemistry and air quality impacts.",Mitochondria Targeting and Destabilizing Hyaluronic Acid Derivative-Based Nanoparticles for the Delivery of Lapatinib to Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566834,Biomacromolecules,2019 02 11,"CD44 receptor and mitochondria targeting hyaluronic acid-d-α-tocopherol succinate-(4-carboxybutyl)triphenyl phosphonium bromide (HA-TS-TPP)-based nanoparticles (NPs) were designed for the delivery of lapatinib (LPT) to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). While LPT is one of the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human EGFR2 (HER2), TNBC cells often exhibit EGFR positive and HER2 negative patterns. Along with the HER2-independent anticancer activities of LPT in TNBC, apoptosis-inducing properties of TPP and TS (resulting from mitochondrial targeting and destabilization) were introduced to amplify the anticancer activities of HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs for TNBC. HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs, with approximately 207 nm mean diameter, unimodal size distribution, spherical shape, negative zeta potential, and sufficient particle stability, were prepared in this study. The improved antiproliferation potential, apoptotic efficacy, and mitochondrial destabilizing activity of HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs, compared with HA-TS/LPT NPs, were demonstrated in TNBC (i.e., MDA-MB-231) cells. The in vivo tumor targeting capability of HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs was proven in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mouse models using real-time optical imaging. Of note, HA-TS-TPP/LPT NPs exhibited a better tumor growth suppression profile than the other groups after intravenous injection. It is expected that developed HA-TS-TPP NPs can elevate the therapeutic potential of LPT for TNBC.",Methane Emission Reductions from the Alternate Wetting and Drying of Rice Fields Detected Using the Eddy Covariance Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566833,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 16,"Rice cultivation contributes 11% of the global 308 Tg CH4 anthropogenic emissions. The alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation practice can conserve water while reducing CH4 emissions through the deliberate, periodic introduction of aerobic soil conditions. This paper is the first to measure the impact of AWD on rice field CH4 emissions using the eddy covariance (EC) method. This method provides continuous, direct observations over a larger footprint than in previous chamber-based approaches. Seasonal CH4 emissions from a pair of adjacent, production-sized rice fields under delayed flood (DF) and AWD irrigation were compared from 2015 to 2017. Across the 2 fields and 3 years, cumulative CH4 emissions in the production season were in the range of 7.1 to 31.7 kg CH4-C ha-1 for the AWD treatment and in the range of 75.7-141.6 kg CH4-C ha-1 for the DF treatments. Correcting for field-to-field differences in CH4 production, the AWD practice reduced seasonal CH4 emissions by 64.5 ± 2.5%. The AWD practice is increasingly implemented for water conservation in the mid-south region of the United States; however, based on this study, it also has great potential for reducing CH4 emissions."

In crop wheat (Triticum aestivum), molecular responses to waterlogging are poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) genes in hexaploid wheat and identified 25 genes, which were induced by waterlogging with diverse manner. Among them, TaERFVII.1 exhibited differential expression patterns between waterlogging-tolerant wheat Nonglin46 and susceptible wheat Yangmai16 under waterlogging. Constitutive expression of TaERFVII.1 with an MYC-peptide tag at its N terminus in wheat enhanced tolerance to waterlogging as evidenced by increased grain weight per plant, survival rate, and chlorophyll content of leaves and by increased expression of waterlogging-responsive genes, while silencing of TaERFVII.1 compromised the expression of waterlogging-responsive genes. Notably, constitutive expression of the stabilized TaERFVII.1 did not negatively impact both plant development and grain yield under standard conditions. We further demonstrated that constitutive expression of stabilized TaERFVII.1 elevated the transcriptional level of TaSAB18.1, the ortholog of Arabidopsis HRA1 and rice SAB18, consequently reduced the expression of waterlogging-responsive genes under standard conditions. These results suggest that TaERFVII.1 plays an important role in wheat tolerance to waterlogging, and it could be a candidate for improving crop waterlogging tolerance.",Interventions for treating wrist fractures in children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566764,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 05 22,"Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children.

Unfortunately, the transient Compounds I (CI) and II (CII) from peroxide activation of the enzyme resting state (RS) are unstable. Therefore, the reduction potentials (E°') of the three redox couples (CI/RS, CI/CII and CII/RS) were estimated (for the first time in a ligninolytic peroxidase) from equilibrium concentrations analyzed by stopped-flow UV/Vis spectroscopy. Interestingly, the E°' of rate-limiting CII reduction to RS increased 70 mV from the common peroxidase ancestor to extant lignin peroxidase (LiP), and the same boost was observed for CI/RS and CI/CII, albeit with higher E°' values. A straightforward correlation was found between the E°' value and the progressive displacement of the proximal histidine Hϵ1 chemical shift in the NMR spectra, due to the higher paramagnetic effect of the heme Fe3+ . More interestingly, the E°' and NMR data also correlated with the evolutionary time, revealing that ancestral peroxidases increased their reduction potential in the evolution to LiP thanks to molecular rearrangements in their heme pocket during the last 400 million years."

We confirmed MALAT1 upregulation in two independent MS cohorts (1.5-fold increase; P < 0.01; 59 cases, 50 controls). We hence performed MALAT1 overexpression/knockdown in cell lines, demonstrating that its modulation impacts on endogenous expression of splicing factors (HNRNPF and HNRNPH1) and on AS of MS-associated genes (IL7R and SP140). Minigene-based splicing assays upon MALAT1 modulation recapitulated IL7R and SP140 isoform unbalances observed in patients. RNA-sequencing of MALAT1-knockdown Jurkat cells further highlighted MALAT1 role in splicing (approximately 1100 significantly-modulated AS events) and revealed its contribution to backsplicing (approximately 50 differentially expressed circular RNAs).

The methodology used in this study proved to be useful to test the variation of the effect of DEET between pyrethroid-susceptible and -resistant bed bugs.","Exposure of the External Carotid Artery Through the Posterior Neck Triangle, Cadaveric Surgical Simulation: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566681,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2018 12 19,"The external carotid artery (ECA) is a robust extracranial donor used for high-flow cerebrovascular bypass procedures. It is usually exposed through the anterior triangle of the neck and may be used to revascularize recipients in the anterior or upper posterior cerebral circulations. However, when a high-flow bypass to the posterior circulation is indicated, oftentimes the patient needs to be put in the prone position (or variants thereof). In such situations, accessing the ECA through the anterior triangle of the neck can be challenging. Therefore, using a technique that enables the surgeon to expose the ECA through a posterior approach could be helpful.1 Although we have not yet encountered a case requiring this type of exposure and bypass, this cadaveric surgical simulation video demonstrates the surgical technique of exposing the ECA through the posterior triangle of the neck (as a cadaveric video, no patient consent was necessary). Briefly, this technique involves an inferolateral extension of the muscular stage of the far-lateral approach and exposing the ECA through a plane developed between the parotid gland and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The technical details of this technique are described. Also, relevant anatomic information regarding the safety measures taken to protect adjacent neurovascular structures are discussed.",The Tudor protein Veneno assembles the ping-pong amplification complex that produces viral piRNAs in Aedes mosquitoes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566680,Nucleic acids research,2019 03 29,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) comprise a class of small RNAs best known for suppressing transposable elements in germline tissues. The vector mosquito Aedes aegypti encodes seven PIWI genes, four of which are somatically expressed. This somatic piRNA pathway generates piRNAs from viral RNA during infection with cytoplasmic RNA viruses through ping-pong amplification by the PIWI proteins Ago3 and Piwi5. Yet, additional insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating non-canonical piRNA production are lacking. TUDOR-domain containing (Tudor) proteins facilitate piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and other model organisms. We thus hypothesized that Tudor proteins are required for viral piRNA production and performed a knockdown screen targeting all A. aegypti Tudor genes. Knockdown of the Tudor genes AAEL012437, Vreteno, Yb, SMN and AAEL008101-RB resulted in significantly reduced viral piRNA levels, with AAEL012437-depletion having the strongest effect. This protein, which we named Veneno, associates directly with Ago3 in an sDMA-dependent manner and localizes in cytoplasmic foci reminiscent of piRNA processing granules of Drosophila. Veneno-interactome analyses reveal a network of co-factors including the orthologs of the Drosophila piRNA pathway components Vasa and Yb, which in turn interacts with Piwi5. We propose that Veneno assembles a multi-protein complex for ping-pong dependent piRNA production from viral RNA.","Colony Size, Rather Than Geographic Origin of Stocks, Predicts Overwintering Success in Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in the Northeastern United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566679,Journal of economic entomology,2019 03 21,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are key pollinators of agricultural crops. However, approximately 30% of managed colonies die each winter in the United States. There has been great interest in breeding for 'locally adapted stocks' which survive winter conditions in a particular region. Here, we evaluate the impact of geographic origin of stock on colony weight, population size, and overwintering survival. Comparing four different U.S. honey bee stocks (two bred in southern and two bred in northern regions) under standard beekeeping practices in three different apiary locations in central Pennsylvania, we examined possible adaptation of these stocks to temperate conditions. We confirmed the genotypic difference among the stocks from different geographic origins via microsatellite analysis. We found that stock or region of origin was not correlated with weight, population size, or overwintering success. However, overwintering success was influenced by the weight and population size the colonies reached prior to winter where higher colony weight is a strong predictor of overwintering survival. Although the number of locations used in this study was limited, the difference in average colony sizes from different locations may be attributable to the abundance and diversity of floral resources near the honey bee colonies. Our results suggest that 1) honey bees may use similar strategies to cope with environmental conditions in both southern and northern regions, 2) colonies must reach a population size threshold to survive adverse conditions (an example of the Allee effect), and 3) landscape nutrition is a key component to colony survival."

The dose-rate effects on cell survival can be expressed by the change of the β term in the linear quadratic model. The value at a high-dose-rate decreases below 60 Gy/h and reaches zero at 0.2 Gy/h or less for photons. However, the effect for a high-LET ion-beam is not well known. At HIMAC, cells were exposed to 70 keV/μm carbon-ion beams at different dose-rates between 0.5 and 600 Gy/h at room temperature. The β values for all survival curves show no significant differences among the dose-rates tested for HSG, V79 and CHO cells. Changing the ion-beam dose-rate had no effect on cell survival. This suggests that high-LET particle beams, such as galactic cosmic rays, may not exhibit a dose-rate effect on cell survival.

The enzyme from Mycobacterium smegmatis is essential for cell survival and distinct from other eubacteria in having several unusual characteristics. To understand genome-wide TopoI engagements in vivo, functional sites were mapped by employing a poisonous variant of the enzyme and a newly discovered inhibitor, both of which arrest the enzyme activity after the first transestrification reaction, thereby leading to the accumulation of protein-DNA covalent complexes. The cleavage sites are subsets of TopoI binding sites, implying that TopoI recruitment does not necessarily lead to DNA cleavage in vivo. The cleavage protection conferred by nucleoid associated proteins in vitro suggest a similar possibility in vivo. Co-localization of binding and cleavage sites of the enzyme on transcription units, implying that both TopoI recruitment and function are associated with active transcription. Attenuation of the cleavage upon Rifampicin treatment confirms the close connection between transcription and TopoI action. Notably, TopoI is inactive upstream of the Transcription start site (TSS) and activated following transcription initiation. The binding of TopoI at the Ter region, and the DNA cleavage at the Ter indicates TopoI involvement in chromosome segregation, substantiated by its catenation and decatenation activities.",DEFINED BIOLOGICAL MODELS OF HIGH-LET RADIATION LESIONS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566664,Radiation protection dosimetry,2019 05 28,"DNA double-strand break (DSB) complexity is invoked to explain the increased efficacy of high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. Complexity is usually defined as presence of additional lesions in the immediate proximity of the DSB. DSB-clusters represent a different level of complexity that can jeopardize processing by destabilizing chromatin in the vicinity of the cluster. DSB-clusters are generated after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR), particularly high-LET radiation, and have been considered as particularly consequential in several mathematical models of IR action. Yet, experimental demonstration of their relevance to the adverse IR effects, as well as information on the mechanisms underpinning their severity as DNA lesions is lacking. We addressed this void by developing cell lines with especially designed, multiply integrated constructs modeling defined combinations of DSB-clusters through appropriately engineered I-SceI meganuclease recognition sites. Using this model system, we demonstrate efficient activation of the DNA damage response, as well as a markedly increased potential of DSB-clusters, as compared to single-DSBs, to kill cells, and cause Parp1- dependent chromosomal translocations. We propose that DSB repair relying on first line DSB-processing pathways (canonical non-homologous end joining and to some degree homologous recombination repair) is compromised within DSB clusters, presumably through the associated chromatin destabilization, leaving alternative end joining as last option and translocation formation as a natural consequence. Our observations offer a mechanistic explanation for the increased efficacy of high-LET radiation.",RADIATION SHIELDING STUDY FOR THE VERTICAL TEST SYSTEM FOR SUPERCONDUCTING RF CAVITIES.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566663,Radiation protection dosimetry,2018 12 19,"A vertical test system (VTS) for superconducting radio frequency cavities had been designed and constructed at Peking University. During the test, field emission electrons in the cavity will be accelerated and some of them will hit the flange of cavity with high-energy. These high-energy electrons will have a significant impact on the radiation safety of the system and environment. In this paper, the Particle-in-Cell solver in CST software was used to analyze the behavior of electrons emitted from different field emission positions and found the worst field emission site which deposited the most energy on the cavity wall. The impact information of the electrons emitted from the worst field emission site was utilized to character the source term. Prompt dose equivalent rate distribution and residual radioactivity was predicted by using the Monte Carlo simulation program FLUKA. Further vertical test results are consistent with the simulation results.","Screening for psychosocial distress among patients with cancer: implications for clinical practice, healthcare policy, and dissemination to enhance cancer survivorship.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566662,Translational behavioral medicine,2019 04 15,"Accreditation standards are at the forefront of evolving healthcare systems, setting metrics for high-quality care. Healthcare outcomes (health, experience, cost, provider satisfaction/burn out) are becoming mutual goals of the patient, provider, payer, and healthcare system. Achieving high-quality outcomes in cancer care necessitates collaboration among interdisciplinary teams of clinical providers, administrators, patient advocates, caregivers, and researchers. Dissemination and implementation science provides necessary frameworks to organize the efforts of these implementation teams, inclusive of identifying facilitators and barriers to implementation of accreditation standards. Since 2015, cancer distress screening has been mandated for continued cancer center accreditation by the American College of Surgeon's Commission on Cancer. Cancer centers have thus become real world implementation laboratories. We present the current context of distress screening, highlighting prior research and key areas of future research. We consider multiple levels of cancer care delivery and the use of interdisciplinary teams to help cancer center teams adopt, implement, and maintain efficient distress screening programs. Finally, we present a case study to identify methods for successful implementation of distress screening at one cancer center and then describe efficiencies that can be introduced using elements from human factors engineering, e- and m-health screening platforms, and community partnerships.",Using Intervention Mapping to develop and implement a home-based sedentary behavior change intervention after stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566661,Translational behavioral medicine,2018 12 19,"Prolonged sedentary behavior is a problem immediately following a stroke and it persists from the acute to chronic phases of recovery. Frequently interrupting sedentary time might help to mitigate the associated detrimental health consequences. The purpose of this article was to describe the process followed in the systematic development and implementation of a theory- and home-based sedentary behavior change intervention for people with stroke. The Intervention Mapping protocol was used to design, develop and implement a STand Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS) program aimed at reducing prolonged sedentary behavior after stroke. A qualitative inquiry with people with stroke (n = 13) informed the development of the intervention. The systematic approach followed in the development process including the theoretical basis, content development, and evaluation planning were described. Program reception was assessed using thematic content analysis of exit-interview data (n = 25). The 8-weeks STUFFS intervention is a home-based sedentary behavior change program that provides education about the risks of prolonged sedentary behavior and facilitates behavior change, including the use of motivational tools to empower people with stroke to reduce sedentary behavior. The program was well-received and acceptable to people with stroke (89% satisfaction). This article provides information that furthers knowledge about theory-based strategies to reduce sedentary behavior in the home environment after stroke and facilitates implementation of this type of intervention.Trial registration: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (No. NCT02980744).",Microsurgical Resection of Low-Grade Spinal Cord Astrocytoma: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566660,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2018 12 19,"This video demonstrates microsurgical resection of low-grade (Grade I) thoracic spinal cord astrocytoma.

A spinal MRI revealed T1/T2 hyperintense intramedullary tumor at T4, suggesting spinal cord astrocytoma versus ependymoma. Dura was opened in the midline and tacked to the surrounding muscle tissue with tacking sutures. The arachnoid was opened separately with microscissors, keeping it intact for closure at the end of surgery. Liga clips were applied to hold the arachnoid to the dura. Myelotomy was done in the midline,5 opening the posterior median sulcus over the length of the tumor and extending proximally and distally a few millimeters beyond the tumor.3,5 The tumor reduction was achieved by coagulation or debulking. Once sufficient debulking was achieved, dissection of the tumor margins toward surrounding cord was performed. Preoperative recording of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) compared with continuous intraoperative MEPs were essential for preserving the neurological function and quality of life. The intraoperative finding of a clear tumor plane of resection carries positive prognostic significance and reduces the risk of complications.2,3,6 A pathohistological diagnosis showed a low-grade (Grade I) spinal cord astrocytoma (pilocytic).

The variation in dose responses was examined in H. punctigera field populations collected in eastern Australia between September 2013 and January 2016 and compared with a laboratory strain. Chlorantraniliprole was the most toxic insecticide with an average LC50 of 3.7 µg of insecticide per liter of diet (n = 12 field strains). The average LC50 for emamectin benzoate was 5.6 µg of insecticide per liter of diet (n = 11 field strains), whereas indoxacarb had the lowest toxicity with an average LC50 of 172 µg of insecticide per liter of diet (n = 14 field strains). Variation in susceptibility between field strains was low at 1.9-, 2.4-, and 2-fold for chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, and indoxacarb, respectively. Narrow ranges of intra-specific tolerance, high slopes, and goodness-of-fit to a probit binomial model suggested feeding bioassays using insecticide-incorporated diet were a more effective laboratory method for measuring dose responses of these insecticides in H. punctigera than traditional topical bioassays. We propose discriminating concentrations of 0.032, 0.026, and 4 µg of insecticide/ml of diet for chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, and indoxacarb, respectively, to monitor insecticide resistance in H. punctigera.

This would resolve the dosage imbalance between eutherian females (XX) versus male (XY) and between a single active X versus autosome pairs (A). Expression ratio of X- and A-linked genes has been relatively well studied in humans and mice, despite controversial results over the existence of upregulation of X-linked genes. Here we report the first comprehensive test of Ohno's hypothesis in bovine preattachment embryos, germline, and somatic tissues. Overall an incomplete dosage compensation (0.5 < X:A < 1) of expressed genes and an excess X dosage compensation (X:A > 1) of ubiquitously expressed ""dosage-sensitive"" genes were seen. No significant differences in X:A ratios were observed between bovine female and male somatic tissues, further supporting Ohno's hypothesis. Interestingly, preimplantation embryos manifested a unique pattern of X dosage compensation dynamics. Specifically, X dosage decreased after fertilization, indicating that the sperm brings in an inactive X to the matured oocyte. Subsequently, the activation of the bovine embryonic genome enhanced expression of X-linked genes and increased the X dosage. As a result, an excess compensation was exhibited from the 8-cell stage to the compact morula stage. The X dosage peaked at the 16-cell stage and stabilized after the blastocyst stage. Together, our findings confirm Ohno's hypothesis of X dosage compensation in the bovine and extend it by showing incomplete and over-compensation for expressed and ""dosage-sensitive"" genes, respectively.",A Comparative Immunogenicity and Safety Trial of Two Different Schedules of Single-visit Intradermal Rabies Post-exposure Vaccination Following a Single-visit Pre-exposure Vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566636,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2018 12 19,Effective and safe single-visit rabies vaccination for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP) could substantially simplify rabies prevention and therefore increase compliance.,Imidacloprid Soil Drenches Affect Weight and Functional Response of Spined Soldier Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566635,Journal of economic entomology,2019 03 21,"There are ongoing concerns of potential direct and indirect lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides on nontarget arthropod populations. The risk to natural enemies from systemic insecticides is mainly through exposure to the active ingredient by ingestion, and such risk may be elevated for omnivores that feed on treated plants, as well as herbivores that also feed on those same treated plants. Podisus maculiventris (Say), an important natural enemy in many agricultural systems, can be potentially exposed to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid when ingesting contaminated prey and feeding on plants subjected to soil-drench applications of this compound. In the current study, we examined the potential impact of imidacloprid soil drenches on some functional and morphological endpoints. Cabbage plants were treated with soil drenches of imidacloprid that corresponded to half and full recommended labels rates against whiteflies and aphids. Fourth instar diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), larvae on plants were used as prey in our experiments; P. xylostella is not a target of imidacloprid applications but may co-occur with other pests in systems where the insecticide is applied. We found that exposure to imidacloprid-treated plants did not cause significant mortality neither to P. maculiventris nor to P. xylostella, but both treatment concentrations impaired the predation, with consequences for predator weight gain during the assessment period. Our results corroborate those from other studies and demonstrate that effects from systemic insecticides can transcend trophic levels to affect natural enemies indirectly, such as through exposure from feeding on pests not targeted by the insecticide.",Immune Gene Diversity in Archaic and Present-day Humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566634,Genome biology and evolution,2019 04 12,"Genome-wide analyses of two Neandertals and a Denisovan have shown that these archaic humans had lower genetic heterozygosity than present-day people. A similar reduction in genetic diversity of protein-coding genes (gene diversity) was found in exome sequences of three Neandertals. Reduced gene diversity, particularly in genes involved in immunity, may have important functional consequences. In fact, it has been suggested that reduced diversity in immune genes may have contributed to Neandertal extinction. We therefore explored gene diversity in different human groups, and at different time points on the Neandertal lineage, with a particular focus on the diversity of genes involved in innate immunity and genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).We find that the two Neandertals and a Denisovan have similar gene diversity, all significantly lower than any present-day human. This is true across gene categories, with no gene set showing an excess decrease in diversity compared with the genome-wide average. Innate immune-related genes show a similar reduction in diversity to other genes, both in present-day and archaic humans. There is also no observable decrease in gene diversity over time in Neandertals, suggesting that there may have been no ongoing reduction in gene diversity in later Neandertals, although this needs confirmation with a larger sample size. In both archaic and present-day humans, genes with the highest levels of diversity are enriched for MHC-related functions. In fact, in archaic humans the MHC genes show evidence of having retained more diversity than genes involved only in the innate immune system.",Sex Differences Along the Autism Continuum: A Twin Study of Brain Structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566633,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2019 02 22,"Females might possess protective mechanisms regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and require a higher detrimental load, including structural brain alterations, before developing clinically relevant levels of autistic traits.

N = 148 twins (62 females) from 49 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic same-sex pairs were included. Participants were distributed along the whole continuum of autism including twin pairs discordant and concordant for clinical ASD.

Within-twin pair increases in autistic traits were related to decreases in cortical volume and surface area of temporal and frontal regions specifically in female twin pairs, in particular regions involved in social communication, while only two regions were associated with autistic traits in males. The same pattern was detected in the monozygotic twin pairs only. Thus, non-shared environmental factors seem to impact female more than male cerebral architecture associated with autistic traits. Our results are in line with the hypothesis of a female protective effect in autism and highlights the need to study ASD in females separately from males.",Convergence of ecophysiological traits drives floristic composition of early lineage vascular plants in a tropical forest floor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566632,Annals of botany,2019 06 10,"Tropical understorey plant communities are highly diverse and characterized by variable resource availability, especially light.

At the end of the experiment, AID of ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), Ca, and P were determined and samples of the mid-jejunum and -ileum were collected for histomorphological observations. Data were subjected to ANOVA analysis using the GLM procedure. Orthogonal polynomial contrasts were used to assess linear and quadratic effects of different levels of the muramidase. At the end of the trial, Muramidase 007 supplementation linearly increased body weight gain and decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P ≤ 0.05). Adding the muramidase to broiler diets also linearly increased the European poultry efficiency factor (P ≤ 0.05). Inclusion of the muramidase in broiler diets linearly increased AID of CP, EE, and P (P ≤ 0.05), and the H group had a higher AID of EE and CP compared to C group (P ≤ 0.05). Microbial muramidase supplementation linearly increased ileal villus length to crypt depth ratio and decreased the number of ileal CD45 cells (P ≤ 0.05). Broilers fed M and H diets had fewer number of CD45 cells in the ileum compared to those in C group (P ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that inclusion of the microbial muramidase in broiler diets could increase AID of key nutrients and improve growth performance in broilers. Adding microbial muramidase to broiler diets can therefore be considered as an interesting prospect to improve gastrointestinal functionality. Biological mechanisms causing these improvements need to be studied further.",Impact of document consolidation on healthcare providers' perceived workload and information reconciliation tasks: a mixed methods study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566630,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019 04 26,"Information reconciliation is a common yet complex and often time-consuming task performed by healthcare providers.

Remarkably, the recombination-preferred ${{att}}{{{C}}_{{\rm{bs}}}}$ predominantly formed the straight hairpin, while the ${{att}}{{{C}}_{{\rm{ts}}}}$ preferentially adopted the kinked structure, which exposes only one complete recombinase binding box. By a mutational analysis, we identified three bases in the unpaired central spacer, which could invert the preferred conformations and increase the recombination frequency of the ${{att}}{{{C}}_{{\rm{ts}}}}$in vivo. A bioinformatics screen revealed structural bias toward a straight, canonical hairpin conformation in the bottom strand of many antibiotic resistance cassettes attC sites. Thus, we anticipate that structural fine tuning could be a mechanism in many biologically active DNA hairpins."

White matter changes remain less understood, particularly their association to cortical structure and function. Here, we focused on region that has gained only little attention in ASD neuroimaging: the superficial white matter (SWM) immediately beneath the cortical interface, a compartment playing a prominent role in corticogenesis that incorporates long- and short-range fibers implicated in corticocortical connectivity. Studying a multicentric dataset of ASD and neurotypical controls, we harnessed surface-based techniques to aggregate microstructural SWM diffusion features. Multivariate analysis revealed SWM anomalies in ASD compared with controls in medial parietal and temporoparietal regions. Effects were similar in children and adolescents/adults and consistent across sites. Although SWM anomalies were more confined when correcting for cortical thickness and surface area, findings were overall robust. Diffusion anomalies modulated functional connectivity reductions in ASD and related to symptom severity. Furthermore, mediation models indicated a link between SWM changes, functional connectivity, and symptom load. Analyses targeting the SWM offer a novel perspective on the interplay between structural and functional network perturbations in ASD, highlighting a potentially important neurobiological substrate contributing to its diverse behavioral phenotype.","Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) on an Invasive Edge: Abundance, Spatial Distribution, and Habitat Usage of Larvae and Pupae Across Urban and Socioeconomic Environmental Gradients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566612,Journal of medical entomology,2019 02 25,"The Asian tiger mosquito [Aedes albopictus (Skuse)] is an invasive species of public health importance that is currently expanding its range in the Northeast United States. Effective Ae. albopictus control depends on a thorough understanding of factors influencing their abundance, spatial distribution, and habitat preference. We conducted a series of container surveys for Ae. albopictus larvae/pupae over 2 yr across nine sites in neighborhoods along its invasive range in southern New York. Selected sites represented a gradient of percent impervious surface and median household income. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) Ae. albopictus larval/pupal abundance increases and spatial distribution becomes less clustered as site-level median income decreases and percent impervious surface increases because of increased larval habitat quality and availability; and 2) container-level characteristics are predictive of Ae. albopictus larval/pupal infestation across a range of sites. In 2016, neither median household income nor impervious surface predicted Ae. albopictus abundance. In 2017, sites with greater impervious surface were more heavily infested by some measures. In both years, Ae. albopictus larval/pupal spatial distribution as measured by K-function was more clustered in with greater median household income. Most container characteristics were either not predictive of Ae. albopictus or varied between years. Based on the variability of predictive container characteristics, we conclude that identification of key containers is not useful in this region. However, Ae. albopictus can be nonhomogenously distributed or abundant based on income level and impervious surface. Improved control of immatures should consider these regional predictors of Ae. albopictus populations.",External Validation of the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists (SAHIT) Predictive Model Using the Barrow-Ruptured Aneurysm Trial (BRAT) Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566611,Neurosurgery,2018 12 19,"The Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists (SAHIT) repository is a collection of randomized clinical trials, prospective observational studies, and hospital registries that was used to create a predictive model of unfavorable outcome/mortality following aneurysmal SAH.",Prenatal Bisphenol A Exposure in Mice Induces Multitissue Multiomics Disruptions Linking to Cardiometabolic Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566610,Endocrinology,2019 02 02,"The health impacts of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) remain debated, and their tissue and molecular targets are poorly understood. In this study, we leveraged systems biology approaches to assess the target tissues, molecular pathways, and gene regulatory networks associated with prenatal exposure to the model EDC bisphenol A (BPA). Prenatal BPA exposure at 5 mg/kg/d, a dose below most reported no-observed-adverse-effect levels, led to tens to thousands of transcriptomic and methylomic alterations in the adipose, hypothalamus, and liver tissues in male offspring in mice, with cross-tissue perturbations in lipid metabolism as well as tissue-specific alterations in histone subunits, glucose metabolism, and extracellular matrix. Network modeling prioritized main molecular targets of BPA, including Pparg, Hnf4a, Esr1, Srebf1, and Fasn as well as numerous less studied targets such as Cyp51 and long noncoding RNAs across tissues, Fa2h in hypothalamus, and Nfya in adipose tissue. Lastly, integrative analyses identified the association of BPA molecular signatures with cardiometabolic phenotypes in mouse and human. Our multitissue, multiomics investigation provides strong evidence that BPA perturbs diverse molecular networks in central and peripheral tissues and offers insights into the molecular targets that link BPA to human cardiometabolic disorders.",Application of Mindfulness in a Tier 3 Obesity Service Improves Eating Behavior and Facilitates Successful Weight Loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566609,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2019 01 30,Mindfulness strategies may facilitate healthier eating behavior but have not previously been studied in a United Kingdom-based tier 3 obesity service.,Container Size Alters the Outcome of Interspecific Competition Between Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566608,Journal of medical entomology,2019 04 17,"Aedes aegypti L. and Aedes albopictus Skuse co-occur in a variety of water-filled containers where they compete for resources. Larvae of Ae. albopictus Skuse often outcompete those of Ae. aegypti L., but variation in biotic and abiotic parameters can modify the outcome of this interspecific competition. We tested whether container size can alter the magnitude and direction of intra- and interspecific competition by rearing three Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larval combinations (100:0, 50:50 and 0:100) in three container sizes (small, medium, and large). For both mosquito species, individuals raised in small- and medium-sized containers had shorter development time to adulthood, higher survival to adulthood, and larger adult body size compared to individuals from large containers. For Ae. aegypti but not Ae. albopictus, survival to adulthood was significantly influenced by a two-way interaction between container size and larval competition. The negative effect of interspecific competition was stronger in the small and medium containers and the negative effect of intraspecific competition was stronger in large containers. Our results show that container size can affect the outcome of intra- and interspecific competition between Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and may help account for the observed patterns of both competitive exclusion and coexistence documented in the field for these two medically important mosquito species.","Vertical Sampling in Tree Canopies for Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Life Stages and its Egg Parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566607,Environmental entomology,2019 02 28,"The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an invasive agricultural and nuisance pest that has established across much of the United States and caused significant crop losses in the Mid-Atlantic region.

In Virginia, small pyramid traps baited with 'low-dose' H. halys pheromone lures were deployed via a pulley system at the lower, mid-, and upper canopy of female tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle) in 2016 and 2017 and male A. altissima and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.) in 2017. Weekly captures of adults and nymphs were recorded throughout each season. Each year, additional female A. altissima trees were felled during the two main periods of H. halys oviposition. The number and relative locations of all pentatomid egg masses found on foliage were recorded and any parasitoids that emerged from them were identified. Halyomorpha halys adults and nymphs were captured in greatest numbers in upper canopy traps and in lowest numbers in traps near the tree base. More H. halys egg masses were collected from mid-canopy than from the lower or upper canopy.

In Exp. 1, 42 barrows (63.8 ± 2.1 kg BW) were allotted to seven diets in a completely randomized design with six replicates per diet. Diets included a corn-soybean meal (SBM) diet and six additional diets containing 4.85%, 9.70%, 19.40%, 29.10%, 38.80%, or 48.50% CGM. Pigs were fed twice daily, at 0730 and 1630 hours, at a level of 4% of BW, and feces and urine were collected for 5 d. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, CP, acid-hydrolyzed ether extract, and the DE and ME in diets linearly decreased (P < 0.01) as dietary CGM increased. Inclusion level of CGM had no effect on the DE and ME values of CGM. On a DM basis, the concentration of DE and ME varied from 3,396 to 3,747 kcal/kg and 3,107 to 3,502 kcal/kg, respectively. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (30.4 ± 2.9 kg BW) with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were allotted to an 11 × 6 Youden square design with 11 diets and 6 period, which included an N-free diet and 10 CGM test diets.

The average SID of Pro was 101.76%, with an SEM of 17.26. Increasing dietary CGM decreased the ATTD of nutrients, the DE and ME values of diets but CGM. The AID and SID of AA in CGM are low but source dependent, and CGM may be fed to pigs as an protein-rich feedstuff.","The Effects of Diets and Long-term Laboratory Rearing on Reproduction, Behavior, and Morphology of Lucilia cuprina (Diptera: Calliphoridae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566594,Journal of medical entomology,2019 04 17,"The Australian sheep blow fly, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann), is commonly reared in the laboratory for many sequential generations on simple, fixed diets, so it can be used in veterinary, medical, and forensic studies. To investigate the effect of diet and long-term laboratory rearing on L. cuprina, flies were fed with two different diets (sugar and milk-sugar) over a year and F1, F6, and F11 generations were used for comparisons based on the number of eggs, attraction to wool and liver, and wing size. The results showed that the number of eggs of gravid flies, and the attractiveness of wool and liver did not differ significantly between diets and generations, but gravid flies were more attracted to wool and liver than non-gravid flies (P < 0.05). Moreover, in the F1 generation, thorax length and wing aspect ratio were significantly longer than in the F6 and F11 generations (P < 0.05), and the wing length was significantly longer than in the F11 generation (P < 0.05). It was concluded that neither diet nor long-term laboratory rearing affect potential fecundity or the behavioral responses of L. cuprina, but the gravidity of flies affects their behavioral response, and long-term laboratory rearing significantly affects fly morphology, apparently explaining a loss in flight performance.",The effect of summer drought on the yield of Arundo donax is reduced by the retention of photosynthetic capacity and leaf growth later in the growing season.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566593,Annals of botany,2018 12 19,"The development of Arundo donax as a biomass crop for use on drought-prone marginal lands in areas with warm to hot climates is constrained by the lack of variation within this species.

Pivotal nonclinical safety studies that support human clinical trials are performed according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines, which are designed to ensure that the study was conducted under carefully controlled conditions using standardized and validated procedures that will yield a reliable, reproducible, and traceable data set. The GLP guidelines established by different regulatory agencies address organizational structure, personnel responsibilities, personnel training practices, quality assurance (ensuring compliance), facilities, equipment, standard operating procedures, study documentation (record keeping), and record and sample retention. Academic institutions engaging in nonclinical safety assessment on-site have multiple options for implementing a GLP quality system. This article outlines the rationale supporting the use of a GLP-compliant or GLP-like quality system in academia and reviews key concepts needed to efficiently and effectively implement GLP in the academic setting. Emphasis is given to provision of GLP-compliant pathology support as (1) pathology data are an essential component of GLP nonclinical safety testing, (2) familiarity with pathology-related GLP procedures typically is gained first outside the academic setting, and (3) microscopic pathology diagnoses and interpretations require special accommodations to ensure that they are undertaken in a GLP-compliant fashion.",The role of pollinator preference in the maintenance of pollen colour variation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566588,Annals of botany,2018 12 19,"Pollinators often drive the evolution of floral traits, but their capacity to influence the evolution of pollen colour remains unclear.

Laminin--α2 has two main binding partners within the MBM, dystroglycan and integrin. Integrins coordinate both cell adhesion and signalling; however, there is little mechanistic insight into integrin's function at the MBM. In order to study integrin's role in basement membrane development and how this relates to the MBM's capacity to handle force, an itgβ1.b-/- zebrafish line was created. Histological examination revealed increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition at the MBM in the itgβ1.b-/- fish when compared with controls. Surprisingly, both laminin and collagen proteins were found to be increased in expression at the MBM of the itgβ1.b-/- larvae when compared with controls. This increase in ECM components resulted in a decrease in myotomal elasticity as determined by novel passive force analyses. To determine if it was possible to control ECM deposition at the MBM by manipulating integrin activity, RGD peptide, a potent inhibitor of integrin-β1, was injected into a zebrafish model of MDC1A. As postulated an increase in laminin and collagen was observed in the lama2-/- mutant MBM. Importantly, there was also an improvement in fibre stability at the MBM, judged by a reduction in fibre pathology. These results therefore show that blocking ITGβ1 signalling increases ECM deposition at the MBM, a process that could be potentially exploited for treatment of MDC1A."

In the present study, we explored whether AdipoRon attenuates isoprenaline (ISO) or l-thyroxine-induced cardiac hypertrophy in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and whether the anti-hypertrophy effect is mediated by AMPK-related pathway. Here, cardiac hypertrophy was induced by injection of l-thyroxine or ISO in SD rats. In the treatment group, AdipoRon was co-administered. We examined the effects of AdipoRon on cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophy signaling pathway. The weight of SD rats was recorded every day. Rats were killed for collection of blood and heart under anesthesia. The left heart weight and heart weight were weighed. Paraffin-embedded heart tissue regions (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson to detect left heart hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. The serum BNP levels were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of ANP, BNP, PGC-1α, and ERRα were evaluated by real-time PCR analysis. The protein expression levels of PGC-1α, ERRα, and pAMPK/AMPK were determined by western blot analysis. The results showed that AdipoRon significantly reversed heart weight (HW)/body weight (BW) ratio, left ventricular (LV)/BW ratio, serum BNP level and the mRNA level of ANP and BNP induced by ISO or l-thyroxine. ISO or l-thyroxine reduced both the mRNA level and protein level of ERRα and PGC-1α, and also reduced the protein level of pAMPK/AMPK. However, AdipoRon reversed ISO or l-thyroxine-induced changes of pAMPK/AMPK, ERRα, and PGC-1α. Our data indicated that the effects of AdipoRon are mediated partly by activating AMPK-related pathway, and AdipoRon plays a potential role in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy.",Prevalence of Ehrlichia canis (Rickettsiales: Ehrlichieae) DNA in Tissues From Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Acari: Ixodidae) Ticks in Areas Endemic for Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566570,Journal of medical entomology,2019 04 17,"Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) is a disease caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia canis.

Six independent variables, including the absorption and desorption times (ranging from 15 to 25 min), stirring speed (ranging from 550 to 650 rpm), pH of solution (ranging from 4.0 to 6.0), amount of NaCl (ranging from 0.30 to 0.40 mol/L) and temperature of extraction process (ranging from 40 to 50°C) were coded as A, B, C, D, E and F at three various levels (-1, 0 and 1). Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits calculated were 0.17, 0.33 and 0.38 μg/L, respectively, for 2-CP, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The linear ranges of method were 1.0-100.0 μg/L for all CPs studied. This method was employed for the direct extraction and determination of three CPs in seawater samples.","Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 Update on Diagnosis, Treatment, Chemoprophylaxis, and Institutional Outbreak Management of Seasonal Influenzaa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566567,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 03 05,"These clinical practice guidelines are an update of the guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2009, prior to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore the corresponding potential mechanism. The expression level of TRIM29 in HCC samples and hepatoma cell lines was detected. We found that TRIM29 was down-regulated in clinical HCC samples and cultured hepatoma cell lines by western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we demonstrated that higher TRIM29 expression was associated with higher differentiation grade of HCC. To explore the effect of TRIM29 on hepatoma cells and its possible mechanisms, TRIM29-knockdown and overexpression cell models were constructed. The results showed that the depletion of TRIM29 promoted liver cancer cell proliferation, clone formation, migration and invasion in vitro probably through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated for shape abnormalities in the thalamus in patients with PD. Twenty-five patients with PD and 25 HC participants (all female) were recruited for the study. A voxel-wise volume comparison analysis and a vertex-wise shape analysis were conducted to evaluate structural abnormalities in the PD patients compared to HC. The patients with PD demonstrated significant gray matter volume reductions in the thalamus bilaterally, relative to the HC. The shape analysis detected significant inward deformation in some thalamic regions in the PD patients, including the anterior nucleus, mediodorsal nucleus, and pulvinar nucleus.

This deletion involves the β-subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, a key energy sensor in the cell. Although neurons have a high demand for energy and low capacity to store nutrients, the role of AMPK in neuronal physiology is poorly defined. Here we show that AMPK is important in the nervous system for maintaining neuronal integrity and for stress survival and longevity in Drosophila. To understand the impact of this signaling system on behavior and its potential contribution to the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, we focused on sleep, an important role of which is proposed to be the reestablishment of neuronal energy levels that are diminished during energy-demanding wakefulness. Sleep disturbances are one of the most common problems affecting individuals with psychiatric disorders. We show that AMPK is required for maintenance of proper sleep architecture and for sleep recovery following sleep deprivation. Neuronal AMPKβ loss specifically leads to sleep fragmentation and causes dysregulation of genes believed to play a role in sleep homeostasis. Our data also suggest that AMPKβ loss may contribute to the increased risk of developing mental disorders and sleep disturbances associated with the human 1q21.1 deletion.",Correction: Treating Depressive Symptoms in Psychosis: A Network Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Non-Verbal Therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566532,PloS one,2019 05 01,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0140637.].,New insights of polyamine metabolism in testicular physiology: A role of ornithine decarboxylase antizyme inhibitor 2 (AZIN2) in the modulation of testosterone levels and sperm motility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566531,PloS one,2019 05 20,"The specific role of polyamines in the testis physiology is not fully understood. Antizymes (OAZs) and antizyme inhibitors (AZINs) are modulators of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis and polyamine uptake. Although the three known OAZs are expressed in the testis, only OAZ3 is testis specific and has been proven to have an essential role in male fertility. Regarding the two existing AZINs, AZIN2 is the most abundantly expressed member in this gonad. Whereas previous studies suggested that AZIN2 might participate in mouse spermatogenesis, immunohistological analysis of human testicular sections revealed that AZIN2 is also detected in the steroidogenic Leydig cells but not in the germinal epithelium. In the present study, we found a close ontogenic similarity in the mRNA levels of OAZs and AZINs between mice and rats, but an opposite expression pattern of ODC activity. Further analysis of AZIN2 and OAZ3 in the testis of mice with different alterations in spermatogenesis and fertility, induced either genetically or pharmacologically, corroborated that both AZIN2 and OAZ3 are mainly expressed in the haploid germinal cells. Finally, by using transgenic mice with a truncated Azin2 gene fused to the bacterial lacZ gene, we studied the expression of Azin2 in testes, epididymides and spermatozoa. AZIN2 was detected in spermatids and spermatozoa, as well as in Leydig cells, and in epithelial epidydimal cells. Azin2 knock-out male mice were fertile; however, they showed marked decreases in testicular putrescine and plasma and testicular testosterone levels, and a dramatic reduction in the sperm motility. These results suggest an important role for AZIN2 in testicular cells by modulating polyamine concentrations, testosterone synthesis and sperm function. Overall, our data corroborate the relevance of polyamine regulation in testis functions, where both AZIN2 and OAZ3 play fundamental roles.",Hepatitis B virus core protein phosphorylation: Identification of the SRPK1 target sites and impact of their occupancy on RNA binding and capsid structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566530,PLoS pathogens,2019 02 15,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its 3 kb DNA genome through capsid-internal reverse transcription, initiated by assembly of 120 core protein (HBc) dimers around a complex of viral pregenomic (pg) RNA and polymerase. Following synthesis of relaxed circular (RC) DNA capsids can be enveloped and secreted as stable virions. Upon infection of a new cell, however, the capsid disintegrates to release the RC-DNA into the nucleus for conversion into covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA. HBc´s interactions with nucleic acids are mediated by an arginine-rich C terminal domain (CTD) with intrinsically strong non-specific RNA binding activity. Adaptation to the changing demands for nucleic acid binding during the viral life cycle is thought to involve dynamic phosphorylation / dephosphorylation events. However, neither the relevant enzymes nor their target sites in HBc are firmly established. Here we developed a bacterial coexpression system enabling access to definably phosphorylated HBc. Combining Phos-tag gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and mutagenesis we identified seven of the eight hydroxy amino acids in the CTD as target sites for serine-arginine rich protein kinase 1 (SRPK1); fewer sites were phosphorylated by PKA and PKC. Phosphorylation of all seven sites reduced nonspecific RNA encapsidation as drastically as deletion of the entire CTD and altered CTD surface accessibility, without major structure changes in the capsid shell. The bulk of capsids from human hepatoma cells was similarly highly, yet non-identically, phosphorylated as by SRPK1. While not proving SRPK1 as the infection-relevant HBc kinase the data suggest a mechanism whereby high-level HBc phosphorylation principally suppresses RNA binding whereas one or few strategic dephosphorylation events enable selective packaging of the pgRNA/polymerase complex. The tools developed in this study should greatly facilitate the further deciphering of the role of HBc phosphorylation in HBV infection and its evaluation as a potential new therapeutic target.",Correction: Expression of immunohistochemical markers in non-oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566529,PloS one,2019 05 01,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0202790.].,Increased breadth of HIV-1 neutralization achieved by diverse antibody clones each with limited neutralization breadth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566528,PloS one,2019 05 28,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are rarely elicited by current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine designs, but the presence of bNAbs in naturally infected individuals may be associated with high plasma viral loads, suggesting that the magnitude, duration, and diversity of viral exposure may contribute to the development of bNAbs. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from two subjects who developed broadly neutralizing autologous antibody responses during HIV-1 infection. In both subjects, we identified collections of mAbs that exhibited specificity only to a few autologous envelopes (Envs), with some mAbs exhibiting specificity only to a subset of Envs within the quasispecies of a particular sample at one time point. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) isolated from these subjects mapped mostly to epitopes in the Env V3 loop region and the CD4 binding site. None of the individual neutralizing mAbs recovered exhibited the cumulative breadth of neutralization present in the serum of the subjects. Surprisingly, however, the activity of polyclonal mixtures comprising individual mAbs that each possessed limited neutralizing activity, could achieve increased breadth of neutralizing activity against autologous isolates. While a single broadly neutralizing antibody targeting one epitope can mediate neutralization breadth, the findings presented here suggest that a cooperative polyclonal process mediated by diverse antibodies with more limited breadth targeting multiple epitopes also can achieve neutralization breadth against HIV-1.",Cost-effectiveness of treatments for non-osteoarthritic knee pain conditions: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566527,PloS one,2019 05 20,Knee pain is common in adolescents and adults and is associated with an increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis.

Hunter syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis type II is a progressive rare disease caused by a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate 2-sulphatase. It is inherited in an X-linked manner resulting in males being significantly affected. Expression in females varies with the majority being unaffected although symptoms may emerge over time. We developed a Naïve Bayes classification (NBC) algorithm utilizing the clinical diagnosis and symptoms of patients contained within their de-identified and unstructured electronic medical records (EMR) extracted by the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). To do so, we created a training dataset using published results in the scientific literature and from all MPS II symptoms and applied the training dataset and its independent features to compute the conditional posterior probabilities of having MPS II disease as a categorical dependent variable for 506497 male patients. The classifier identified 125 patients with the highest likelihood for having the disease and 18 features were selected to be necessary for forecasting. Next, a Recursive Backward Feature Elimination algorithm was employed, for optimal input features of the NBC model, using a k-fold Cross-Validation with 3 replicates. The accuracy of the final model was estimated by the Validation Set Approach technique and the bootstrap resampling. We also investigated that whether the NBC is as accurate as three other Bayesian networks. The Naïve Bayes Classifier appears to be an efficient algorithm in assisting physicians with the diagnosis of Hunter syndrome allowing optimal patient management."

Help networks were based on the peer nomination question ""Who helps you with problems?"" Building on previous studies on classroom climate and individual network position, higher academic achievement was expected in classrooms with: a dense help network; no or a few network isolates (referring to students that did not give or receive help at all); less segmentation in help relations; equally distributed help nominations. In addition, higher achievement was expected for individuals with more helpers and a more central position in the help network. Using the Dutch SNARE data (54 classrooms; 1,144 students), the multilevel models suggested that lower achievement was related to an unequal distribution of help relations in a classroom. Moreover, the centrality of individuals in the help network was linked to higher achievement. Classrooms varied strongly on network dimensions, and networks that would theoretically be expected to be most beneficial for achievement (with high density, a few isolates, low segmentation, and high equality) turned out to be highly uncommon. The findings demonstrated that subtle network processes were relevant for academic success, and that classroom network characteristics are associated with classroom-level variation in academic achievement. Descriptive results underlined the complexity of the social context of classrooms, and the absence of 'beneficial' classrooms suggests that researchers should adjust their notion of what is a beneficial or detrimental classroom environment for adolescents.",An evaluation of fertility- and migration-based policy responses to Japan's ageing population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566513,PloS one,2019 05 20,"Japan's ongoing struggle with rapid ageing is well known. Fertility and migration policies have both been proposed as solutions to Japan's ageing population. We used stock flow population models to estimate the impact of hypothetical fertility and migration policy interventions on measures of aging in Japan from 2015 to 2050. We evaluated policy models based on the Old Age Dependency Ratio (OADR) they produced at the specified end date. Start dates ranged from 2020 to 2030 to assess the time horizons of individual policies. Fertility policies were found to be highly time dependent and only slowed the rate of increase of OADR. It would require a Total Fertility Rate far above replacement levels to compensate for Japan's already aged demography. Migration policy was less time dependent. However, such measures would require unprecedented, and ultimately unrealistic, volumes of migration over coming decades in order to reduce Japan's OADR. Our results suggest that fertility and migration based policy responses will be unable to significantly reduce Japan's OADR or reverse Japan's ageing population within the next few decades. Japan should focus on activating its human capital through the prolongation of working lives, increasing participation, and improving productivity within the Japanese labour force to mitigate and adapt to the inevitable effects of ageing populations.",Gradual reduction in exercise capacity in chronic kidney disease is associated with systemic oxygen delivery factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566512,PloS one,2019 05 20,The cause of reduced exercise capacity (ExCap) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is multifactorial.

We assessed the current status of PAH in the Korean population. The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) claim database, which comprises nationwide medical insurance data of Koreans from 2008-2016, was assessed to determine the current status of PAH. Overall, 1,307 patients were newly diagnosed with PAH from 2008-2016 (0.0005%, annual incidence: 4.84 patients/1 million people/year). The mean age at diagnosis was 44±13 years (range 18-65) and patients were mostly women (n = 906, 69.3%). Cases of idiopathic PAH (51.6%) accounted for the largest proportion, followed by acquired PAH (APAH) associated with congenital heart disease (25.8%) and APAH with connective tissue disease (17.2%). Overall, 807 (61.7%) patients received a single PAH-specific treatment based on their last prescription, of which bosentan (50.6%) was the most frequently used. Only 240 (18.4%) patients received combination therapy, with the bosentan-beraprost combination (32.9%) being the most common.

Social network data consist of social interactions between pairs of individuals that are temporally aggregated over a certain interval of time, and the level of such temporal aggregation can have substantial impact on social network monitoring. There have been several studies on the effect of temporal aggregation in the process monitoring literature, but no studies on the effect of temporal aggregation in social network monitoring. We use the degree corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM) to simulate social networks and network anomalies and analyze these networks in the context of both count and binary network data. In conjunction with this model, we use the Priebe scan method as the monitoring method. We demonstrate that temporal aggregation at high levels leads to a considerable decrease in the ability to detect an anomaly within a specified time period. Moreover, converting social network communication data from counts to binary indicators can result in a significant loss of information, hindering detection performance. Aggregation at an appropriate level with count data, however, can amplify the anomalous signal generated by network anomalies and improve detection performance. Our results provide both insights on the practical effects of temporal aggregation and a framework for the study of other combinations of network models, surveillance methods, and types of anomalies.",HSF1 mediated stress response of heavy metals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566508,PloS one,2019 05 21,"The heat shock response (HSR) pathway is a highly conserved cellular stress response and mediated by its master regulator HSF1. Activation of the pathway results in the expression of chaperone proteins (heat shock proteins; HSP) to maintain protein homeostasis. One of the genes strongest upregulated upon stress is HSPA1A (HSP72). Heavy metals are highly toxic to living organisms and known as environmental contaminants, due to industrialisation. Furthermore, many of them are well-described inducers of the HSR pathway. Here we compare the effect of different heavy metals, concerning their potential to activate HSF1 with a sensitive artificial heat shock reporter cell line, consisting of heat shock elements (HSE). In general the responses of the artificial promoter to heavy metal stress were in good agreement with those of well-established HSF1 target genes, like HSPA1A. Nevertheless, differences were observable when effects of heat and heavy metal stress were compared. Whereas heat stress preferentially activated the HSE promoter, heavy metals more strongly induced the HSPA1A promoter. We therefore analysed the HSPA1A promoter in more detail, by isolating and mutating the HSEs. The results indicate that the importance of the individual binding sites for HSF1 is determined by their sequence similarity to the consensus sequence and their position relative to the transcription start site, but they were not differentially affected by heat or heavy metal stress. In contrast, we found that other parts of the HSPA1A promoter have different impact on the response under different stress conditions. In this work we provide deeper insights into the regulation of HSP72 expression as a well as a method to quantitatively and sensitively evaluate different stressor on their potential to activate HSF1.",High prevalence of strabismic visual field expansion in pediatric homonymous hemianopia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566507,PloS one,2019 05 20,"If homonymous hemianopia develops in childhood it is frequently accompanied by strabismus. In some of these cases the strabismus increases the size of the binocular visual field. We determined how prevalent visual-field-expanding strabismus is in children who have homonymous hemianopia. Medical records were examined from 103 hemianopic patients with exotropia (XT) or esotropia (ET). For each participant, we determined whether their strabismus was in a direction that resulted in visual field expansion (i.e. left exotropia with left homonymous hemianopia). Ages at which hemianopia and strabismus were first noted were compared to determine which developed first. The prevalence of XT (24%) and ET (9%) with homonymous hemianopia were both much higher than in the general population (1.5% and 5%, respectively). More strabismic eyes pointed to the blind than seeing side (62 vs 41, 60% vs. 40%, p = 0.02). Exotropic eyes were five times more likely to point to the blind side than esotropic eyes (85% vs 15%). Strabismus, especially exotropia, is much more common in pediatric homonymous hemianopia than in the general population. The strabismus is significantly more often in a visual field-expanding direction. These results support an adaptive role for the strabismus. Patients with HH and exotropia or esotropia should be aware that their visual field could be reduced by strabismus surgery.",Predictors of male circumcision incidence in a traditionally non-circumcising South African population-based cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566506,PloS one,2019 05 21,"Voluntary medical male circumcision has been promoted in high HIV prevalence settings to prevent HIV acquisition in males.

High levels of ZIKV RNA were, however, also detected in mice and non-human primates in organs other than the brain, such as the liver. As ZIKV is a flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever virus, which are known to cause hepatitis, we here examined whether human hepatocytes are susceptible to ZIKV infection. We demonstrated that both human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and the Huh7 hepatoma cell line support the complete ZIKV replication cycle. Of three antiviral molecules that inhibit ZIKV infection in Vero cells, only 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) inhibited ZIKV replication in hPSC-HLCs, while all drugs inhibited ZIKV infection in Huh7 cells. ZIKV-infected hPSC-HLCs but not Huh7 cells mounted an innate immune and NFκβ response, which may explain the more extensive cytopathic effect observed in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, ZIKV productively infects human hepatocytes in vitro. However, significant differences in the innate immune response against ZIKV and antiviral drug sensitivity were observed when comparing hPSC-HLCs and hepatoma cells, highlighting the need to assess ZIKV infection as well as antiviral activity not only in hepatoma cells, but also in more physiologically relevant systems.",Strain specific differences in rates of Photosystem II repair in picocyanobacteria correlate to differences in FtsH protein levels and isoform expression patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566504,PloS one,2019 05 21,"Picocyanobacteria are the numerically dominant photoautotrophs of the oligotrophic regions of Earth's oceans. These organisms are characterized by their small size and highly reduced genomes. Strains partition to different light intensity and nutrient level niches, with differing photosynthetic apparatus stoichiometry, light harvesting machinery and susceptibility to photoinactivation. In this study, we grew three strains of picocyanobacteria: the low light, high nutrient strain Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9313; the high light, low nutrient Prochlorococcus marinus MED 4; and the high light, high nutrient marine Synechococcus strain WH 8102; under low and high growth light levels. We then performed matched photophysiology, protein and transcript analyses. The strains differ significantly in their rates of Photosystem II repair under high light and in their capacity to remove the PsbA protein as the first step in the Photosystem II repair process. Notably, all strains remove the PsbD subunit at the same rate that they remove PsbA. When grown under low light, MIT 9313 loses active Photosystem II quickly when shifted to high light, but has no measurable capacity to remove PsbA. MED 4 and WH 8102 show less rapid loss of Photosystem II and considerable capacity to remove PsbA. MIT 9313 has less of the FtsH protease thought to be responsible for the removal of PsbA in other cyanobacteria. Furthermore, by transcript analysis the predominant FtsH isoform expressed in MIT 9313 is homologous to the FtsH 4 isoform characterized in the model strain Synechocystis PCC 6803, rather than the FtsH 2 and 3 isoforms thought to be responsible for PsbA degradation.

Considering that the ability of an epitope to elicit effective humoral immunity depends on its exposure on the virion, we have used a reverse genetics approach to select variants from an HIV-1 AC10_29 randomly mutated envelope library that showed increased affinity for a selected bNAb (4E10 bNAb targeting the HIV-1 MPER region). Isolated envelope sequences were analyzed by deep-sequencing showing a small number of dominant changes, including the loss of four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and disruption of the V1/V2 loop. Accordingly, the dominant variant (LR1-C1), showed not only increased affinity for MPER bNAbs 4E10 and 2F5, but also higher affinity for an additional antibody targeting the V3 loop (447-52D) that could be a consequence of an open conformation tier 1-like Env. Furthermore, the amino acids specific for the selected variant are associated with an increased sensitivity for 4E10 and 2F5 antibodies. In vivo studies showed that sera from mice immunized with LR1-C1 viruses possessed an improved neutralizing activity compared to the wild-type AC10_29 env. While Virus Like Particles (VLPs) carrying this envelope were unable to induce detectable neutralizing activity in immunized rabbits, one animal showed antibody response to the 4E10-proximal region. Our data establish a novel approach that has the potential to yield HIV envelope immunogen sequences that direct antibody responses to specific envelope regions.",Survival and drifting patterns of grass carp eggs and larvae in response to interactions with flow and sediment in a laboratory flume.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566492,PloS one,2019 05 06,"A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to better understand the behavior of grass carp eggs and larvae in moving water in order to develop and implement new strategies for control and prediction of their dispersal and drift at early life stages. Settling velocity and density of a representative sample of eggs were estimated, and three trials of flume experiments with different flow conditions were conducted with live eggs in a temperature-controlled setting with a mobile sediment bed. In these trials, egg and larval stages were continuously analyzed over periods of 80 hours; and eggs and larvae interactions with the flow and sediment bed were monitored and characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. Survival rates were quantified after each trial, highlighting physical causes for increased mortality. Detailed flow analysis was correlated to the observed drifting and swimming behavior of eggs and larvae, to estimate distributions across the water depth, as well as traveling and swimming speeds. Evidence of the influence of mean and turbulent flow in the suspension and transport of eggs are reported, and swimming patterns of larvae at different developmental stages are described. These findings support the development of new strategies for monitoring the spread of grass carp eggs and larvae in rivers, and provide new inputs to predict conditions favorable for spawning and hatching, allowing for mitigation measures at early life stages, which are critical to control their dispersal.","Space-use patterns highlight behavioural differences linked to lameness, parity, and days in milk in barn-housed dairy cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566490,PloS one,2019 05 30,"Lameness is a key health and welfare issue affecting commercial herds of dairy cattle, with potentially significant economic impacts due to the expense of treatment and lost milk production. Existing lameness detection methods can be time-intensive, and under-detection remains a significant problem leading to delayed or missed treatment. Hence, there is a need for automated monitoring systems that can quickly and accurately detect lameness in individual cows within commercial dairy herds. Recent advances in sensor tracking technology have made it possible to observe the movement, behaviour and space-use of a range of animal species over extended time-scales. However, little is known about how observed movement behaviour and space-use patterns in individual dairy cattle relate to lameness, or to other possible confounding factors such as parity or number of days in milk. In this cross-sectional study, ten lame and ten non-lame barn-housed dairy cows were classified through mobility scoring and subsequently tracked using a wireless local positioning system. Nearly 900,000 spatial locations were recorded in total, allowing a range of movement and space-use measures to be determined for each individual cow. Using linear models, we highlight where lameness, parity, and the number of days in milk have a significant effect on the observed space-use patterns. Non-lame cows spent more time, and had higher site fidelity (on a day-to-day basis they were more likely to revisit areas they had visited previously), in the feeding area. Non-lame cows also had a larger full range size within the barn. In contrast, lame cows spent more time, and had a higher site-fidelity, in the cubicle (resting) areas of the barn than non-lame cows. Higher parity cows were found to spend more time in the right-hand-side area of the barn, closer to the passageway to the milking parlour. The number of days in milk was found to positively affect the core range size, but with a negative interaction effect with lameness. Using a simple predictive model, we demonstrate how it is possible to accurately determine the lameness status of all individual cows within the study using only two observed space-use measures, the proportion of time spent in the feeding area and the full range size. Our findings suggest that differences in individual movement and space-use behaviour could be used as indicators of health status for automated monitoring within a Precision Livestock Farming approach, potentially leading to faster diagnosis and treatment, and improved animal welfare for dairy cattle and other managed animal species.",Correction: Killing wolves to prevent predation on livestock may protect one farm but harm neighbors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566489,PloS one,2019 05 01,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0189729.].,Correction: Economic and clinical burden of viral hepatitis in California: A population-based study with longitudinal analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566488,PloS one,2019 05 01,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196452.].,"Mapping reduced introgression loci to the X chromosome of the hybridizing field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566487,PloS one,2019 05 30,"The genomic architecture of barriers to gene exchange during the speciation process is poorly understood. The genomic islands model suggests that loci associated with barriers to gene exchange prevent introgression of nearby genomic regions via linkage disequilibrium. But few analyses of the actual genomic location of non-introgressing loci in closely related species exist. In a previous study Maroja et al. showed that in the hybridizing field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, 50 non-introgressing loci are localized on two autosomal regions and the X chromosome, but they were not able to map the loci along the X chromosome because they used a male informative cross. Here, we localize the introgressing and non-introgressing loci on the X chromosome, and reveal that all X-linked non-introgressing loci are restricted to a 50-cM region with 10 of these loci mapped to a single location. We discuss the implications of this finding to speciation.","Response to anti-tuberculosis treatment by people over age 60 in Kampala, Uganda.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566486,PloS one,2019 05 06,"While old age is a known risk factor for developing active tuberculosis (TB), studies on TB in the population aged 60 years and older (considered elderly in this study) are few, especially in the developing world. Results of the TB prevalence survey in Uganda found high TB prevalence (570/100,000) in people over 65. We focused on treatment outcomes in the elderly to understand this epidemic better. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from TB facility registers in Kampala City for the period 2014-2015. We analyzed the 2014-15 cohort with respect to age, sex, disease class, patients' human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and directly observed therapy (DOT) status, type of facility, and treatment outcomes and compared findings in the elderly (≥60) and younger (<60) age groups. Of 15,429 records, 3.3% (514/15,429) were for elderly patients. The treatment success rate (TSR) among elderly TB patients (68.3%) was lower than that of the non-elderly (80.9%) and the overall TSR 80.5%, (12,417/15,429) in Kampala. Although the elderly were less likely to test positive for HIV than the young (AOR 0.39; 95% CI 0.33-0.48, p<0.001), they had a two-fold higher risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes (AOR 2.14; CI 1.84-2.72, p<0.001) and were more likely to die while on treatment (AOR 1.86; CI 1.27-2.73; p = 0.001). However, there was no statistically significantly difference between treatment outcomes among HIV-positive and HIV-negative elderly TB patients.

A potential blood-based biomarker indicative of a chronic inflammatory state is N-Terminal Pro C-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NTproCNP). We aim to investigate associations between NTproCNP and ageing-related impairments in cardiovascular function. Community-based participants underwent same-day assessment of cardiovascular function and circulating profiles of plasma NTproCNP. Associations between cardiovascular and biomarker profiles were studied in adjusted models including standard covariates. We studied 93 participants (mean age 73 ± 5.3 years, 36 women), of whom 55 (59%) had impaired myocardial relaxation (ratio of peak velocity flow in early diastole E (m/s) to peak velocity flow in late diastole by atrial contraction A (m/s) <0.84). Participants with impaired myocardial relaxation were also found to have lower peak early phase filling velocity (0.6 ± 0.1 vs 0.7 ± 0.1, p < 0.0001) and higher peak atrial phase filling velocity (0.9 ± 0.1 vs 0.7 ± 0.1, p < 0.0001). NTproCNP levelswere significantly lower among participants with impaired myocardial relaxation (16.4% vs 39.5% with NTproCNP ≥ 19, p = 0.012). After multivariable adjustments, NTproCNP was independently associated with impaired myocardial relaxation (OR 2.99, 95%CI 1.12-8.01, p = 0.029). Community elderly adults with myocardial ageing have lower NTproCNP levels compared to those with preserved myocardial function. Given that impaired myocardial relaxation probably represents early changes within the myocardium with ageing, NTproCNP may be useful as an 'upstream' biomarker useful for charting myocardial ageing.",Correction: Characterization of intra- and inter-host norovirus P2 genetic variability in linked individuals by amplicon sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566483,PloS one,2019 05 01,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201850.].

Previous research suggested that these convoluted nasal passages functioned as heat exchangers analogous to the respiratory turbinates of mammals and birds. We tested this hypothesis by performing a computational fluid dynamic analysis on the nasal passages of two ankylosaurs: Panoplosaurus mirus and Euoplocephalus tutus. Our models predicted that Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus would have required 833 and 1568 thermal calories, respectively, to warm a single breath of air by 20°C. Heat recovery during exhalation resulted in energy savings of 65% for Panoplosaurus and 84% for Euoplocephalus. Our results fell well within the range of values for heat and water savings observed in extant terrestrial amniotes. We further tested alternate airway reconstructions that removed nasal passage convolutions or reduced nasal vestibule length. Our results revealed that the extensive elaboration observed in the nasal vestibules of ankylosaurs was a viable alternative to respiratory turbinates with regards to air conditioning. Of the two dinosaurs tested, Euoplocephalus repeatedly exhibited a more efficient nasal passage than Panoplosaurus. We suggest that the higher heat loads associated with the larger body mass of Euoplocephalus necessitated these more efficient nasal passages. Our findings further indicate that the evolution of complicated airways in dinosaurs may have been driven by the thermal requirements of maintaining cerebral thermal homeostasis.",Asymmetry in reproduction strategies drives evolution of resistance in biological control systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566468,PloS one,2019 04 29,"The success of biological control may depend on the control agent co-evolving with its target pest species, precluding the emergence of resistance that often undermines chemical control. However, recent evidence of a decline in attack rates of a sexual pest weevil by its asexual parasitoid suggests that evolutionary arms races may not prevent the emergence of resistance if the host and parasitoid do not have reproductive strategies that generate equal amounts of genetic variation. To understand how these asymmetries in reproductive strategies may drive the emergence of resistance, we combined life history data from two pest weevils and their parasitoids (one sexual and one asexual) in the New Zealand pastoral ecosystem, with a population dynamic model that allows the coevolution of hosts and parasitoids. We found that the ratio of the genetic variance of hosts to parasitoids was a key determinant of the emergence of resistance. Host resistance eventually occurred unless the parasitoids had considerably greater additive genetic variance than their host. The higher reproductive rate of asexual parasitoids did little to offset the cost of reduced additive genetic variance. The model predictions were congruent with long-term parasitism rates observed in the field for both of the pests considered (one with a sexual and one with an asexual parasitoid). We then explored the consequences of introducing two parasitoids with different reproductive strategies that attack the same sexual host. The model showed that the sexually reproducing parasitoid always out-competed the asexually reproducing one. Our study shows that any asymmetry in reproductive strategies is extremely important for predicting the long-term success of biological control agents. Fortunately, introduction of sexually reproducing individuals after an initial introduction of asexual strains may overcome the problems of host resistance. We conclude that evolution must be considered when evaluating the long-term outcomes of importation biological control.",Change in fish functional diversity and assembly rules in the course of tidal marsh restoration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566467,PloS one,2019 05 21,"Functional trait theory provides a mechanistic framework to understand change in community composition and community assembly through time and space. Despite this, trait-based approaches have seldom been used in ecological restoration. Succession theory predicts that habitat complexity and resource availability will increase with restoration time, leading to increased functional dissimilarity among coexisting species. However, in the case of tidal marsh restoration, it is not clear whether reestablishing the harsh abiotic conditions typical of estuaries will initiate successional trajectories. We investigated monotonic changes in the functional structure of fish communities and shifts in assembly mechanisms, with tidal restoration time. A five-level gradient of 'intertidal habitat naturalness' was constructed from a set of artificialized (dyked), restored (with different ages) and natural intertidal sites, and used as a surrogate for restoration progress. The fish ecophases were described using ten functional traits related to food acquisition and swimming ability. The trends in six functional dimensions (identity, richness, evenness, dispersion, originality and specialization) were investigated along the naturalness gradient. Consistenly with succession theory, functional specialization, dispersion and, less markedly, richness increased with intertidal naturalness meaning that restored and natural intertidal habitats supplied fish with specific foraging and dwelling conditions absent from dyked marshes. Community assembly patterns varied with respect to traits and differed at both ends of the naturalness gradient. Dyked marshes were more affected by trait convergence possibly due to limiting resources. Environmental filtering was detected all along the naturalness gradient although the traits affected varied depending on the naturalness level of habitats. Environmental filtering tended to decrease in restored and natural intertidal habitats. Increased naturalness restored the attractivity of benthic habitats as feeding or settling grounds, promoted shelter-seeking vs. free-swimming strategists and favoured ecophases with carnivorous diets, feeding on microinvertebrates and benthic low-mobility macroinvertebrates. Approaches based on functional trait diversity have the potential to question and refine the theoretical frame of ecological restoration and to assist managers in their efforts to restore tidal wetlands.",Molecular detection of dengue virus in patients suspected of Ebola virus disease in Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566466,PloS one,2019 05 06,"Dengue fever is known to be one of the most common arthropod-borne viral infectious diseases of public health importance. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific with an estimated two fifths of the world's population being at risk. The notable endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) found in West Africa, including yellow fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue fever and until recently Ebola have been responsible for most outbreaks with fatal consequences. These VHFs usually produce unclear acute febrile illness, especially in the acute phase of infection. In this study we detected the presence of 2 different serotypes (DENV-2 and DENV-3) of Dengue virus in 4 sera of 150 patients clinically suspected of Ebola virus disease during the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa with the use of serological and molecular test assays. Sequence data was successfully generated for DENV-3 and phylogenetic analysis of the envelope gene showed that the DENV-3 sequences had close homology with DENV-3 sequences from Senegal and India. This study documents molecular evidence of an indigenous Dengue fever viral infection in Ghana and therefore necessitates the need to have an efficient surveillance system to rapidly detect and control the dissemination of the different serotypes in the population which has the potential to cause outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fevers.",Sulphamethazine derivatives as immunomodulating agents: New therapeutic strategies for inflammatory diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566465,PloS one,2019 05 07,"Sulfamethazine (SMZ) (1) is an antibacterial sulfa drug which suppresses the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid.

Structure and elasticity of macroporous, three-dimensional cryogel scaffolds from mixtures of hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen (Coll) were characterized. Both one-component gels formed homogeneous networks, whereas hybrid gels were heterogeneous in terms of elasticity. Most strikingly, local elastic moduli were significantly lower than bulk moduli presumably due to non-equilibrium chain conformations between crosslinks. This was more pronounced in Coll and hybrid gels than in pure HA gels. Local elastic moduli were similar for all gels, irrespective of their different swelling ratio and bulk moduli.

However, the extent of this splanchnocranial influence is unknown. We applied two-block partial least squares analyses of Procrustes shape variables on an ontogenetic series of great ape crania to explore the covariation of the endocranium (the internal braincase) and splanchnocranium (face, or viscerocranium). We hypothesized that a transition between brain growth and splanchnocranial development in the establishment of final endocranial form would be manifest as a change in the pattern of shape covariation between early and adolescent ontogeny. Our results revealed a strong pattern of covariation between endocranium and splanchnocranium, indicating that chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans share a common tempo and mode of morphological integration from the eruption of the deciduous dentition onwards to adulthood: a reflection of elongating endocranial shape and continuing splanchnocranial prognathism. Within this overarching pattern, we noted that species variation exists in magnitude and direction, and that the covariation between the splanchnocranium and endocranium is somewhat weaker in early infancy compared to successive age groups. When correcting our covariation analyses for allometry, we found that an ontogenetic signal remains, signifying that allometric variation alone is insufficient to account for all endocranial-splanchnocranial developmental integration. Finally, we assessed the influence of the cranial base, which acts as the interface between the face and endocranium, on the shape of the vault using thin-plate spline warping. We found that not all splanchnocranial shape changes during development are tightly integrated with endocranial shape. This suggests that while the developmental expansion of the brain is the main driver of endocranial shape during early ontogeny, endocranial development from infancy onwards is moulded by the splanchnocranium in conjunction with the neurocranium.","Size-dependent cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles to Azotobacter vinelandii: Growth inhibition, cell injury, oxidative stress and internalization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566461,PloS one,2019 05 21,"The influence of nanomaterials on the ecological environment is becoming an increasingly hot research field, and many researchers are exploring the mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity on microorganisms.

Smaller size AgNPs correlated with higher toxicity, which was evident from reduced cell numbers. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed this finding, which was carried out with the same concentration of 10 mg/L for 12 h, the apoptotic rates were20.23% and 3.14% for 10 nm and 50 nm AgNPs, respectively. Structural damage to cells were obvious under scanning electron microscopy. Nitrogenase activity and gene expression assays revealed that AgNPs could inhibit the nitrogen fixation of A. vinelandii. The presence of AgNPs caused intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and electron spin resonance further demonstrated that AgNPs generated hydroxyl radicals, and that AgNPs could cause oxidative damage to bacteria. A combination of Ag content distribution assays and transmission electron microscopy indicated that AgNPs were internalized in A. vinelandii cells. Overall, this study suggested that the toxicity of AgNPs was size and concentration dependent, and the mechanism of antibacterial effects was determined to involve damage to cell membranes and production of reactive oxygen species leading to enzyme inactivation, gene down-regulation and death by apoptosis."

A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test assessed whether a skewed birthdate distribution occurred at the youth, junior and senior international team levels and odds-ratios were calculated for RAE distribution. Moreover, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences between the number of international youth, junior and senior level appearances by birth quartiles.

Preoperative spirometry was performed for patients at a high risk of PPCs, such as elderly patients (age >60 years), patients aged <60 years with chronic pulmonary disease, and current smokers. The main outcome was the association between the results of spirometry tests performed within 1 month prior to surgery and the occurrence of PPCs, as determined by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Of the 898 included patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric (372 patients) or colorectal cancer surgery (526 patients), PPC occurred in 117 patients (gastric cancer: 74, colorectal cancer: 43).

However, the preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (%) and FEV1/FVC (%) were not significantly associated with PPCs (P = 0.059 and P = 0.147, respectively). In conclusion, lower preoperative spirometry FVC, but not FEV1 or FEV1/FVC, may predict PPCs in high-risk patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.","RSM1, an Arabidopsis MYB protein, interacts with HY5/HYH to modulate seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid and salinity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566447,PLoS genetics,2019 03 04,"MYB transcription factors are involved in many biological processes, including metabolism, development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1 (RSM1) belongs to a MYB-related subfamily, and previous transcriptome analysis suggests that RSM1 may play roles in plant development, stress responses and plant hormone signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms of RSM1 action in response to abiotic stresses remain obscure. We show that down-regulation or up-regulation of RSM1 expression alters the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of RSM1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) regulate RSM1 expression via binding to the RSM1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal that RSM1 mediates multiple functions of HY5 in responses of seed germination, post-germination development to ABA and abiotic stresses, and seedling tolerance to salinity. Pull-down and BiFC assays show that RSM1 interacts with HY5/HYH in vitro and in vivo. RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), thereby regulating its expression, while RSM1 interaction also stimulates HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. However, no evidence was found in the dual-luciferase transient expression assay to support that RSM enhances the activation of ABI5 expression by HY. In summary, HY5/HYH and RSM1 may converge on the ABI5 promoter and independently or somehow dependently regulate ABI5 expression and ABI5-downstream ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes, thereby improving the adaption of plants to the environment.","Implementation and maintenance of a pain management quality assurance program at intensive care units: 360 degree feedback of physicians, nurses and patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566446,PloS one,2019 05 03,Pain management quality assurance programs (PMQP) have been successfully implemented in numerous hospitals across Europe.

In this study, we unexpectedly discovered a method to enhance CLG with a VEGF inhibitor, soluble VEGFR1. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent left pneumonectomy, followed by daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection of either saline (control) or 20 μg/kg of VEGFR1-Fc. On post-operative day (POD) 4, mice underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) and lungs were harvested for volume measurement and analyses of the VEGF signaling pathway. To investigate the role of hypoxia in mediating the effects of VEGFR1, experiments were repeated with concurrent administration of PT-2385, an inhibitor of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)2α, via orogastric gavage at 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 days. We found that VEGFR1-treated mice had increased total lung capacity (P = 0.006), pulmonary compliance (P = 0.03), and post-euthanasia lung volume (P = 0.049) compared to control mice. VEGFR1 treatment increased pulmonary levels of VEGF (P = 0.008) and VEGFR2 (P = 0.01). It also stimulated endothelial proliferation (P < 0.0001) and enhanced pulmonary surfactant production (P = 0.03). The addition of PT-2385 abolished the increase in lung volume and endothelial proliferation in response to VEGFR1. By paradoxically stimulating angiogenesis and enhancing lung growth, VEGFR1 could represent a new treatment strategy for neonatal lung diseases characterized by dysfunction of the HIF-VEGF pathway.",Spatial variability of biogeochemistry in shallow coastal benthic communities of Potter Cove (Antarctica) and the impact of a melting glacier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566444,PloS one,2019 05 06,"Measurements of biogeochemical fluxes at the sediment-water interface are essential to investigate organic matter mineralization processes but are rarely performed in shallow coastal areas of the Antarctic. We investigated biogeochemical fluxes across the sediment-water interface in Potter Cove (King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo) at water depths between 6-9 m. Total fluxes of oxygen and inorganic nutrients were quantified in situ. Diffusive oxygen fluxes were also quantified in situ, while diffusive inorganic nutrient fluxes were calculated from pore water profiles. Biogenic sediment compounds (concentration of pigments, total organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen), and benthic prokaryotic, meio-, and macrofauna density and biomass were determined along with abiotic parameters (sediment granulometry and porosity). The measurements were performed at three locations in Potter Cove, which differ in terms of sedimentary influence due to glacial melt. In this study, we aim to assess secondary effects of glacial melting such as ice scouring and particle release on the benthic community and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate. Furthermore, we discuss small-scale spatial variability of biogeochemical fluxes in shallow water depth and the required food supply to cover the carbon demand of Potter Cove's shallow benthic communities. We found enhanced mineralization in soft sediments at one location intermediately affected by glacial melt-related effects, while a reduced mineralization was observed at a location influenced by glacial melting. The benthic macrofauna assemblage constituted the major benthic carbon stock (>87% of total benthic biomass) and was responsible for most benthic organic matter mineralization. However, biomass of the dominant Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica, which contributed 39-69% to the total macrofauna biomass, increased with enhanced glacial melt-related influence. This is contrary to the pattern observed for the remaining macrofauna. Our results further indicated that pelagic primary production is able to fully supply Potter Cove's benthic carbon demand. Therefore, Potter Cove seems to be an autotrophic ecosystem in the summer season.","Factors associated with self-reported falls, balance or walking difficulty in older survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer: Results from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey linkage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566443,PloS one,2019 05 07,Cancer and its treatment affect body systems that are important in preventing falls and controlling balance/walking.

Approximately 25% of the tumours metastasise. Activating c-kit mutations are present in about 20% of tumours, but metastases occur in the absence of mutations. Tumour metastasis is associated with significantly diminished survival in spite of adjuvant chemotherapy. Available prognostic tests do not reliably predict whether a tumour will metastasise. In this study we compared the global expression profiles of 20 primary cutaneous mast cell tumours that metastasised with those of 20 primary tumours that did not metastasise. The objective was to identify genes associated with mast cell tumour metastatic progression that may represent targets for therapeutic intervention and biomarkers for prediction of tumour metastasis. Canine Gene 1.1 ST Arrays were employed for genome-wide expression analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies of mast cell tumours borne by dogs that either died due to confirmed mast cell tumour metastasis, or were still alive more than 1000 days post-surgery. Decreased gene expression in the metastasising tumours appears to be associated with a loss of cell polarity, reduced cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion, and increased cell deformability and motility. Dysregulated gene expression may also promote extracellular matrix and base membrane degradation, suppression of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Down-regulation of gene expression in the metastasising tumours may be achieved at least in part by small nucleolar RNA-derived RNA and microRNA-effected gene silencing. Employing cross-validation, a linear discriminant analysis-based classifier featuring 19 genes that displayed two-fold differences in expression between metastasising and non-metastasising tumours was estimated to classify metastasising and non-metastasising tumours with accuracies of 90-100% and 70-100%, respectively.

However, how WDR62 is regulated and hence controls neurogenesis and brain size remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) forms a complex with WDR62 to promote c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling synergistically in the control of neurogenesis. The deletion of Mekk3, Wdr62, or Jnk1 resulted in phenocopied defects, including premature NPC differentiation. We further showed that WDR62 protein is positively regulated by MEKK3 and JNK1 in the developing brain and that the defects of wdr62 deficiency can be rescued by the transgenic expression of JNK1. Meanwhile, WDR62 is also negatively regulated by T1053 phosphorylation, leading to the recruitment of F-box and WD repeat domain-containing protein 7 (FBW7) and proteasomal degradation. Our findings demonstrate that the coordinated reciprocal and bidirectional regulation among MEKK3, FBW7, WDR62, and JNK1, is required for fine-tuned JNK signaling for the control of balanced NPC self-renewal and differentiation during cortical development.",Non-proteolytic ubiquitin modification of PPARγ by Smurf1 protects the liver from steatosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566427,PLoS biology,2019 05 21,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by abnormal accumulation of triglycerides (TG) in the liver and other metabolic syndrome symptoms, but its molecular genetic causes are not completely understood. Here, we show that mice deficient for ubiquitin ligase (E3) Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis as they age and exhibit the exacerbated phenotype under a high-fat diet (HFD). Our data indicate that loss of Smurf1 up-regulates the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and its target genes involved in lipid synthesis and fatty acid uptake. We further show that PPARγ is a direct substrate of Smurf1-mediated non-proteolytic lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin modification that suppresses its transcriptional activity, and treatment of Smurf1-deficient mice with a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, completely reversed the lipid accumulation in the liver.

We investigated the presence of a correlation between the AQ scores of mothers with children in grades 1 to 6 and their evaluation of assumed pragmatic impairments in children using the Maternal Evaluation of Pragmatic Impairments in Children (MEPC) measure. Mothers were asked to rate how they would feel if their child showed the communication behaviors listed in scales D (coherence), E (inappropriate initiation), F (stereotyped language), G (use of context), and H (nonverbal communication) of the Children's Communication Checklist-2, which measures pragmatic impairments. All responses were given on a five-point Likert scale. The results indicated that the higher the maternal AQ score, the less the mother tended to evaluate pragmatic impairments as a problem. We also examined whether the age and gender of assumed children influenced the correlation between AQ and MEPC scores, but found no significant correlation. The partial correlation coefficients were calculated for each subscale, none of which was significant. A negative correlation was found between AQ and MEPC scores as a whole.",An open-data-driven agent-based model to simulate infectious disease outbreaks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566424,PloS one,2019 05 13,"Agent-based models are a tool that can be used to better understand the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak. An infectious disease outbreak is influenced by many factors including vaccination or immunity levels, population density, and the age structure of the population. We hypothesize that these factors along with interactions of factors and the actions of individuals would lead to outbreaks of different size and severity even in two towns that appear similar on paper. Thus, it is necessary to implement a model that is able to capture these interactions and the actions of individuals. Using openly available data we create a data-driven agent-based model to simulate the spread of an airborne infectious disease in an Irish town. Agent-based models have been known to produce results that include the emergence of patterns and behaviours that are not directly programmed into the model. Our model is tested by simulating an outbreak of measles that occurred in Schull, Ireland in 2012. We simulate the same outbreak in 33 different towns and look at the correlations between the model results and the town characteristics (population, area, vaccination rates, age structure) to determine if the results of the model are affected by interactions of those town characteristics and the decisions on the agents in the model. As expected our results show that the outbreaks are not strongly correlated with any of the main characteristics of the towns and thus the model is most likely capturing such interactions and the agent-based model is successful in capturing the differences in the outbreaks.","Diatom evidence of 20th century ecosystem change in Lake Baikal, Siberia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566423,PloS one,2019 05 13,"Lake Baikal has been experiencing limnological changes from recent atmospheric warming since the 1950s, with rising lake water temperatures, reduced ice cover duration and reduced lake surface-water mixing due to stronger thermal stratification. This study uses lake sediment cores to reconstruct recent changes (c. past 20 years) in Lake Baikal's pelagic diatom communities relative to previous 20th century diatom assemblage records collected in 1993 and 1994 at the same locations in the lake. Recent changes documented within the core-top diatom records agree with predictions of diatom responses to warming at Lake Baikal. Sediments in the south basin of the lake exhibit clear temporal changes, with the most rapid occurring in the 1990's with shifts towards higher abundances of the cosmopolitan Synedra acus and a decline in endemic species, mainly Cyclotella minuta and Stephanodiscus meyerii and to a lesser extent Aulacoseira baicalensis and Aulacoseira skvortzowii. The north basin, in contrast, shows no evidence of recent diatom response to lake warming despite marked declines in north basin ice cover in recent decades. This study also shows no diatom-inferred evidence of eutrophication from deep water sediments. However, due to the localised impacts seen in areas of Lake Baikal's shoreline from nutrient pollution derived from inadequate sewage treatment, urgent action is vital to prevent anthropogenic pollution extending into the open waters.","Inappropriate admissions of the cardiology and orthopedics departments of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566422,PloS one,2019 05 22,"Admission rates have increased in China, despite the fact that accessibility to primary care is improving.

In the present study, we showed by Western blot that a portion of MTP can be detected in the mitochondrial fraction of mouse NS/P cells by immunostaining that it is co-stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) inside the cells. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that MTP is bound to the β subunit of mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase complex (ATP-β). Cyto-immunofluorescence staining and an in situ proximity ligation assay further confirmed a physical interaction between MTP and ATP-β. This interaction relied on the presence of both Cls/Clr urchin embryonic growth factor, bone morphogenic protein 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor motifs of MTP. We found that NS/P cell mitochondrial membrane potential is impaired by MTP knockdown, and ATP synthesis and oxygen consumption rate are significantly reduced in MTP-knockdown NS/P cells. Among the oxidative phosphorylation functions, the greatest effect of MTP knockdown is the reduction by over 50% in the mitochondrial energy reserve capacity. This made MTP-knockdown NS/P cells unable to overcome hydrogen peroxide stress, which leads to cessation of cell growth. This work identifies 2 previously unknown functions for MTP: first as a binding protein in the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase complex and second as a regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Despite the need for unbiased estimates of pathogen occurrence and prevalence for planning effective management interventions, many researchers fail to account for imperfect pathogen detection. Instead raw data are often reported, which may lead to ineffective, or even detrimental, management actions. We illustrate the utility of occupancy models for generating unbiased estimates of disease parameters by 1) providing a written tutorial describing how to fit these models in Program PRESENCE and 2) presenting a case study with the pathogen ranavirus. We analyzed ranavirus detection data from a wildlife refuge (Maryland, USA) using occupancy modeling, which yields unbiased estimates of pathogen occurrence and prevalence. We found ranavirus prevalence was underestimated by up to 30% if imperfect pathogen detection was ignored. The unbiased estimate of ranavirus prevalence in larval wood frog ( Lithobates sylvaticus; 0.73) populations was higher than in larval spotted salamander ( Ambystoma maculatum; 0.56) populations. In addition, the odds of detecting ranavirus in tail samples were 6.7 times higher than detecting ranavirus in liver samples. Therefore, tail samples presented a nonlethal sampling method for ranavirus that may be able to detect early (nonsystemic) infections.",Difference Matters: Teaching Students a Contextual Theory of Difference Can Help Them Succeed.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566379,Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science,2019 04 15,"Today's increasingly diverse and divided world requires the ability to understand and navigate across social-group differences. We propose that interventions that teach students about these differences can not only improve all students' intergroup skills but also help disadvantaged students succeed in school. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this article theorizes that teaching students a contextual understanding of difference can accomplish both of these important goals. Understanding difference as contextual means recognizing that social-group differences come from participating in and adapting to diverse sociocultural contexts. This article begins by reviewing research that highlights two distinct understandings of social-group differences-as contextual or essential-and demonstrates their consequences for intergroup outcomes. We then review research on multicultural and social justice education that highlights the potential benefits of educating students about social-group differences. We propose that these educational approaches are associated with intergroup and academic benefits for one key reason: They teach students a contextual theory of difference. Finally, to illustrate and provide causal evidence for our theory of how a contextual understanding of difference affords these benefits, this article provides an overview of the first social psychological intervention to teach students a contextual understanding of difference: difference-education.",Untethered Stretchable Displays for Tactile Interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566378,Soft robotics,2019 02 13,"Although physical buttons provide tactile sensations that allow them to be identified and pressed without visual focus, their static nature limits their use for dynamic interfaces. Conversely, touchscreens offer highly flexible, task-specific interfaces, but they do not provide the tactile qualities needed for vision-free interaction. Here, we present a stretchable display that can change shape from a flat sheet into a dome when pressurized. The vanishing interface we designed uses hyperelastic light-emitting capacitors (HLECs) that actively emit light, sense strain, and detect finger presses. We characterize the stretch and luminance of the device as the thin sheet is pressurized. Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, these HLEC panels show a pressure-dependent luminance, which we use to highlight where they are being pressed, a visual display of haptic information. We further demonstrate the co-located touch sensing and light-emitting capabilities by developing an interactive memory game.",Warfarin Dose and CYP2C Gene Cluster: An African Ancestral-Specific Variant Is a Strong Predictor of Dose in Black South African Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566377,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2019 03 06,"Warfarin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic index. The rs12777823G>A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CYP2C gene cluster has been shown to influence optimal warfarin doses in African Americans. We report here effects of rs12777823G>A SNP on warfarin dose requirements in two South African population groups, black Africans (BA) and mixed ancestry (MA). A total of 425 participants on warfarin treatment were enrolled in the study. The age group of the studied population ranged between 44 and 66 years, with 69% females enrolled. Genetic characterization of the rs12777823G>A was done using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. To further compare effects of rs12777823G>A to those of other SNPs, VKORC1 g.-1639G>A and 4 SNPs in CYP2C9 gene (i.e., CYP2C9 c.430C>T, c.1075A>C, c.449G>A, and c.1003C>T) were analyzed. The rs12777823A variant allele frequencies were 0.28 and 0.25 in the BA and MA, respectively. The rs12777823A/A genotype was associated with significantly (p = 0.002) reduced mean warfarin dosage (27 ± 5.3 mg/week) compared with the G/G genotype (45 ± 16.1 mg/week) among BA, but not among the MA. The rs12777823G>A is located in a nongenomic region, suggesting that this SNP might be in linkage disequilibrium with another, likely causal SNP that is present in BA only. Given ongoing worldwide efforts to identify clinically relevant human genetic variation impacting on optimal warfarin dose selection, the African ancestry-specific genetic variant in the CYP2C cluster and others warrant further research and consideration in development of future warfarin dosing algorithms for precision medicine guidelines.",Long-Term Exposure to Ultrafine Particles and Incidence of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease in a Prospective Study of a Dutch Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566375,Environmental health perspectives,2019 05 03,"There is growing evidence that exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP; particles smaller than [Formula: see text]) may play an underexplored role in the etiology of several illnesses, including cardiovascular disease (CVD).",The Hippo Pathway: Biology and Pathophysiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566373,Annual review of biochemistry,2018 12 19,"The Hippo pathway was initially discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as a key regulator of tissue growth. It is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade regulating numerous biological processes, including cell growth and fate decision, organ size control, and regeneration. The core of the Hippo pathway in mammals consists of a kinase cascade, MST1/2 and LATS1/2, as well as downstream effectors, transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. These core components of the Hippo pathway control transcription programs involved in cell proliferation, survival, mobility, stemness, and differentiation. The Hippo pathway is tightly regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals, such as mechanical force, cell-cell contact, polarity, energy status, stress, and many diffusible hormonal factors, the majority of which act through G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we review the current understanding of molecular mechanisms by which signals regulate the Hippo pathway with an emphasis on mechanotransduction and the effects of this pathway on basic biology and human diseases Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biochemistry Volume 88 is June 20, 2019.

B,2019 04 15,"Photoreceptor proteins control vital cellular responses to light. The photocycle of the Slr1694 blue light using flavin photoreceptor is initiated by photoexcitation to a locally excited state within the flavin, followed by electron transfer from Tyr8 to the flavin and a proton relay from Tyr8 to the flavin via an intervening glutamine. Herein, the two-dimensional excited state potential energy surfaces associated with this double proton-transfer reaction are computed using the complete active space self-consistent-field method and multiconfigurational perturbation theory, including the protein and solvent environment with electrostatic embedding. The double proton-transfer reaction was found to be energetically unfavorable in the ground state and locally excited state but energetically favorable in the charge-transfer state corresponding to electron transfer from Tyr8 to the flavin. These results indicate that the proton-coupled electron transfer process is sequential, with electron transfer preceding double proton transfer, and that the double proton-transfer reaction is also sequential, with proton transfer from Tyr8 to Gln50 followed by proton transfer from Gln50 to the flavin. The barrier is lower for the first proton-transfer reaction, and both barriers are significantly influenced by geometrical changes within the active site, particularly the proton donor-acceptor distance as well as the protein environment. These calculations provide insight into the impact of protein reorganization and electrostatics on the excited electronic states prior to and during the double proton-transfer reaction. This interplay between excited states and the environment has implications for other photoreceptor proteins.","Dragocins A-D, Structurally Intriguing Cytotoxic Metabolites from a Panamanian Marine Cyanobacterium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566359,Organic letters,2019 06 01,"Dragocins A-D (1-4) were isolated from a dark-red wooly textured marine cyanobacterium collected in Boca del Drago, Panama.

These affect spectroscopic measurements and interpretation, particularly for upcoming brighter XFELs. Here we identify and discuss the limits to observing classical spectroscopy, where only one photon is absorbed per atom for a Mn2+ in a light element (O, C, H) environment. X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) with different incident photon energies, pulse intensities, and pulse durations is presented. A rate equation model based on sequential ionization and relaxation events is used to calculate populations of multiply ionized states during a single pulse and to explain the observed X-ray induced spectral lines shifts. This model provides easy estimation of spectral shifts, which is essential for experimental designs at XFELs and illustrates that shorter X-ray pulses will not overcome sequential ionization but can reduce electron cascade effects.",The Direct Conversion of α-Hydroxyketones to Alkynes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566357,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 16,"Alkynes are highly important functional groups in organic chemistry, both as part of target structures and as versatile synthetic intermediates.

We observe distinct potential energy landscapes experienced by water molecules in the two environments, which nevertheless result in comparable hydrogen bond lifetimes and sound propagation velocities.

This led to an efficient three-atom ring expansion of diarene-fused [1.4]oxazepines and [1.4]thiazepines and led us to propose to term this common approach the hydrated imidazoline ring expansion (HIRE) reaction. The strategy was extended to the insertion of longer (containing up to five atoms) side chains, and thus, larger (11- to 12-membered) diarene-fused rings were obtained via the homo-HIRE and homo2-HIRE reactions, respectively.

In this work, the radical anions of two fluorinated diphenylacetylene derivatives with nonequivalent magnetic nuclei and unknown hyperfine coupling constants ( AHF) were investigated by MARY spectroscopy. The MARY spectra were found to be resolved and have resonance lines in nonzero magnetic fields, which are determined by the AHF values.

We show that only small, 2 nm, nanoparticles can transport MEMC efficiently to the cell nucleus, whereas MEMC cell uptake is much lower when delivered by these small nanoparticles than with the larger ones. 3D cellular models showed that smaller nanoparticles can transport MEMC toward deeper areas of tumor spheroids as compared to larger nanoparticles.

SERS substrates with high tailorability are assumed to be attractive and desirable for SERS detection, because the substrates match the need for the selective detection of different species. Nevertheless, the rational design of such SERS substrates is rather challenging for both noble-metal and semiconductor substrates. Herein, expanding beyond conventional SERS substrates, we demonstrate that metal-organic framework (MOF) materials can serve as a type of SERS substrate with molecular selectivity, which are rarely realized for SERS detection without any special pretreatment. A salient structural characteristic of MOF-based SERS substrates benefiting the SERS selectivity is their high tailorability. By controlling the metal centers, organic ligands, and framework topologies of our MOF-based SERS substrates, we show that the electronic band structures of MOF-based SERS substrate can be purposively manipulated to match those of the target analytes, thus resulting in different detectable species. Going further, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the MOF-based SERS substrates can be greatly enhanced to as high as 106 with a low detection limit of 10-8 M by pore-structure optimization and surface modification, which is comparable to the EFs of noble metals without ""hot spots"" and recently reported semiconductors. This selective enhancement is interpreted as being due to the controllable combination of several resonances, such as the charge-transfer, interband and molecule resonances, together with the ground-state charge-transfer interactions. Our study opens a new venue for the development of SERS substrates with high-design flexibility, which is especially important for selective SERS detection toward specific analytes.","Palladium-Catalyzed Dearomative syn-1,4-Diamination.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566338,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 01,"Herein we report a dearomative syn-1,4-diamination protocol using simple nonactivated arenes and amines.

The effect of incorporating a negatively charged N-terminal tetra-glutamic acid group into the substrate and the effect of masking the negatively charged C-terminal carboxylic acid functionality of the substrate were investigated using confocal fluorescence microscopy in two cell lines, DLD-1 and LnCaP. The addition of a tetra-glutamic acid group to the N-terminus of the intact sequence was shown to reduce cellular uptake of the intact substrate prior to activation by PSA. In contrast, masking the C-terminal carboxylic acid group of the substrate as a methyl ester was shown to improve cellular uptake of the peptide fragment after activation by PSA. The synthesized C-terminal methyl ester substrates with the anthraquinone attached to the side chain were confirmed to be cleaved by PSA in LC-MS analysis, and the cytotoxicity of the substrates was shown to increase in the presence of PSA, consistent with cleavage and uptake of the C-terminal fragment. The results indicate that C- and N-terminal functionalization of peptide substrates targeting PSA can be used to modulate the cellular uptake of peptides before and after enzymatic activation, which may thus be an important consideration in the design of tumor-activated prodrugs.",Asymmetric Synthesis of Griffipavixanthone Employing a Chiral Phosphoric Acid-Catalyzed Cycloaddition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566336,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 23,"Asymmetric synthesis of the biologically active xanthone dimer griffipavixanthone is reported along with its absolute stereochemistry determination.

We investigate this thickness rationale by studying viscous transport mechanisms across nanopores when transitioning the membrane thickness from infinitely thin to finite values. We synthesize double-layer graphene membranes containing pores with diameters from ∼6 to 1000 nm to investigate liquid permeation over a wide range of viscosities and pressures. Nanoporous membranes with thicknesses up to 90 nm realized by atomic layer deposition demonstrate dominance of the entrance resistance for aspect ratios up to one. Liquid permeation across these atomically thin pores is limited by viscous dissipation at the pore entrance. Independent of thickness and universal for porous materials, this entrance resistance sets an upper bound to the viscous transport. Our results imply that membranes with near-ultimate permeation should feature rationally selected thicknesses based on the target solute size for applications ranging from osmosis to microfiltration and introduce a proper perspective to the pursuit of ever thinner membranes.",Efficient Visible-to-NIR Spectral Conversion for Polycrystalline Si Solar Cells and Revisiting the Energy Transfer Mechanism from Ce3+ to Yb3+ in Lu3Al5O12 Host.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566334,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"The so-called Shockley-Queisser converting efficiency limit of Si solar cells is believed to be surpassed by using the spectral converter.

Moreover, the underlying energy transfermechanism from Ce3+ to Yb3+ is systematically re-investigated by the detailed excitation and emission spectra as well as fluorescent decay curves, and our results demonstrate that fast metal-to-metal charge transfer from Ce3+ to nearby Yb3+ is the dominant energy transfermechanism.

Quantifying the varying importance of point and diffuse pollution sources enabled prediction of treatment benefits for a major point source of pollution in one watershed. Instream zinc load increases with river flow (∼3 to 14 kg Zn/d) due to diffuse groundwater and surface runoff pollution sources at higher flows. Lab tests demonstrated that metal release from the streambed, driven by pH decreases at higher flows, also contribute to increased downstream metal loads. Predicting point source treatment benefits demonstrates major instream improvements at low flow (zinc decreases from >800 to 120 μg Zn/L). At higher flows treatment benefits diminish (Zn decreases from 240 to only 200 μg Zn/L) due to the greater influence of diffuse sources. A quantitative understanding of the variable importance of point and diffuse sources of pollution, and instream processes of metal attenuation and release, is crucial to evaluating the benefits of treatment to downstream water quality.",Template-Directed Catalysis of a Multistep Reaction Pathway for Nonenzymatic RNA Primer Extension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566332,Biochemistry,2019 02 12,"Before the advent of polymerase enzymes, the copying of genetic material during the origin of life may have involved the nonenzymatic polymerization of RNA monomers that are more reactive than the biological nucleoside triphosphates. Activated RNA monomers such as nucleotide 5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazolides spontaneously form an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate that undergoes rapid nonenzymatic template-directed primer extension. However, it is unknown whether the intermediate can form on the template or only in solution and whether the intermediate is prone to hydrolysis when bound to the template or reacts preferentially with the primer. Here we show that an activated monomer can first bind the template and then form an imidazolium-bridged intermediate by reacting with a 2-aminoimidazole-activated downstream oligonucleotide. We have also characterized the partition of the template-bound intermediate between hydrolysis and primer extension. In the presence of the catalytic metal ion Mg2+, >90% of the template-bound intermediate reacts with the adjacent primer to generate the primer extension product while less than 10% reacts with competing water. Our results indicate that an RNA template can catalyze a multistep phosphodiester bond formation pathway while minimizing hydrolysis with a specificity reminiscent of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.",Exuberant Immobilization of Urease on an Inorganic SiO2 Support Enhances the Enzymatic Activities by 3-fold for Perennial Utilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566331,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 04 16,"Urease has been covalently immobilized on a 3-D networking silica gel (SG) using dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) as second generation silane coupling reagent and m-nitroaniline as linker component in a robust methodology and subsequently characterized as [{Si(OSi)4(H2O)0.05}205.2] n=4{OSi(CH3)2-NH-C6H4-N═N-urease}·282.5H2O (molecular mass 263 445 g or 263.4 kDa). Selective coupling of tyrosine residue with an identifiable m-nitroaniline modified SG unit prevents enzyme-enzyme cross-linking leading to enhancement of enzymatic activity. The material worked at room temperature and its activity (luminescent and ammonia releasing efficiency) was enhanced by 3-fold (for both synthetic and real sample) compared to native enzyme values at neutral pH. Up to 30 days and 30 cycles, this 3-fold activity remains as such but reduces gradually to native enzyme level after 60 days and 60 cycles of reuse."

To address the problem, herein, we presented an alternative strategy to conquer drug-resistant breast cancer through the combinatorial delivery of Ca2+ channel siRNA with cytotoxic drugs. Mesoporous silica nanocapsules (MSNCs) with mesoporous and hollow structure were fabricated for co-delivery of T-type Ca2+ channel siRNA and doxorubicin (DOX) with high drug loading efficiency. The DOX/siRNA co-loaded MSNCs showed a synergistic therapeutic effect on drug-resistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/ADR, while had only an additive effect on the drug-sensitive MCF-7 counterpart. It was found that the combination of T-type Ca2+ channel siRNA and DOX had a similar effect on MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR in the knockdown of overexpressed T-type Ca2+ channels and decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), but it specifically induced G0/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and intracellular drug accumulation enhancement in MCF-7/ADR. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that the MSNCs with good biocompatibility had a high efficiency for conquering the drug-resistant breast cancer with the DOX/calcium channel siRNA cocktail co-delivery. It provides a biological target for drug/gene delivery enhanced cancer therapy with nanoformulations.",Understanding the Behavior and Mechanism of Oxygen-Deficient Anatase TiO2 toward Sodium Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566318,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"TiO2 has drawn increasing research attention as negative electrode material in sodium ion battery because of its natural abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, and facile preparation. Despite tremendous studies carried out, the sodium storage mechanism is still under discussion, and the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during sodiation/desodiation process are not well understood either. Herein, we reported a mechanism study of graphene-supported oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2 nanotubes (nanowires) as the negative electrode material for sodium ion batteries. Different from the previous reports, the insertion/extraction of Na+ ions leads to almost no changes of titanium valence state but there is a charge redistribution of O 2p orbitals which alters the hybridization between O 2p and Ti 3d states, suggested by the combined electrochemical and X-ray spectroscopic study. Both the electronic and local structures of TiO2 during the reversible sodiation/desodiation process are revealed from the Ti L-edge and O K-edge spectra. This detailed study would shed light on the material design and structural optimization of TiO2 as energy storage material in different systems.",Three-Dimensional Topological Insulator Bi2Te3/Organic Thin Film Heterojunction Photodetector with Fast and Wideband Response from 450 to 3500 Nanometers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566317,ACS nano,2019 04 16,"In the pursuit of broadband photodetection materials from visible to mid-IR region, the fresh three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TIs) are theoretically predicted to be a promising candidate due to its Dirac-like stable surface state and high absorption rate. In this work, a self-powered inorganic/organic heterojunction photodetector based on n-type 3D TIs Bi2Te3 combined with p-type pentacene thin film was designed and fabricated. Surprisingly, it was found that the Bi2Te3/pentacene heterojunction photodetector exhibited a fast and wideband response from 450 to 3500 nm. The optimized responsivity of photodetector reached 14.89 A/W, along with the fast response time of 1.89 ms and the ultrahigh external quantum efficiency of 2840%. Moreover, at the mid-IR 3500 nm, our devices demonstrated a responsivity of 1.55 AW-1, which was several orders of magnitude higher than that of previous 3D TIs photodetector. These excellent properties indicate that the inorganic/organic heterojunction, that is, the combination of 3D TIs with organic materials, is an exciting structure for high performance photodetectors in the wideband detection region. On account of the fact that the device is constructed on mica substrate, this work also represents a potential scenario for flexible optoelectronic devices.","Synthesis, Characterization and in vitro Studies of a Cathepsin B-Cleavable Prodrug of the VEGFR Inhibitor Sunitinib.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566287,Chemistry & biodiversity,2019 03 11,"Since several decades, the prodrug concept has raised considerable interest in cancer research due to its potential to overcome common problems associated with chemotherapy. However, for small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which also cause severe side effects, hardly any strategies to generate prodrugs for therapeutic improvement have been reported so far. Here, we present the synthesis and biological investigation of a cathepsin B-cleavable prodrug of the VEGFR inhibitor sunitinib. Cell viability assays and Western blot analyses revealed, that, in contrast to the non-cathepsin B-cleavable reference compound, the prodrug shows activity comparable to the original drug sunitinib in the highly cathepsin B-expressing cell lines Caki-1 and RU-MH. Moreover, a cathepsin B cleavage assay confirmed the desired enzymatic activation of the prodrug. Together, the obtained data show that the concept of cathepsin B-cleavable prodrugs can be transferred to the class of targeted therapeutics, allowing the development of optimized tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.",Inkjet-Printed High-Q Nanocrystalline Diamond Resonators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566284,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 01 25,"Diamond is a highly desirable material for state-of-the-art micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices, radio-frequency filters and mass sensors, due to its extreme properties and robustness. However, the fabrication/integration of diamond structures into Si-based components remain costly and complex. In this work, a lithography-free, low-cost method is introduced to fabricate diamond-based micro-resonators: a modified home/office desktop inkjet printer is used to locally deposit nanodiamond ink as ∅50-60 µm spots, which are grown into ≈1 µm thick nanocrystalline diamond film disks by chemical vapor deposition, and suspended by reactive ion etching. The frequency response of the fabricated structures is analyzed by laser interferometry, showing resonance frequencies in the range of ≈9-30 MHz, with Q-factors exceeding 104 , and (f0 × Q) figure of merit up to ≈2.5 × 1011 Hz in vacuum. Analysis in controlled atmospheres shows a clear dependence of the Q-factors on gas pressure up until 1 atm, with Q ∝ 1/P. When applied as mass sensors, the inkjet-printed diamond resonators yield mass responsivities up to 981 Hz fg-1 after Au deposition, and ultrahigh mass resolution up to 278 ± 48 zg, thus outperforming many similar devices produced by traditional top-down, lithography-based techniques. In summary, this work demonstrates the fabrication of functional high-performance diamond-based micro-sensors by direct inkjet printing.",Bio-Orthogonal T Cell Targeting Strategy for Robustly Enhancing Cytotoxicity against Tumor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566283,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 01 25,"T cells can kill tumor cells by cell surface immunological recognition, but low affinity for tumor-associated antigens could lead to T cell off-target effects. Herein, a universal T cell targeting strategy based on bio-orthogonal chemistry and glycol-metabolic engineering is introduced to enhance recognition and cytotoxicity of T cells in tumor immunotherapy. Three kinds of bicycle [6.1.0] nonyne (BCN)-modified sugars are designed and synthesized, in which Ac4 ManN-BCN shows efficient incorporation into wide tumor cells with a BCN motif on surface glycans. Meanwhile, activated T cells are treated with Ac4 GalNAz to introduce azide (N3 ) on the cell surface, initiating specific tumor targeting through a bio-orthogonal click reaction between N3 and BCN. This artificial targeting strategy remarkably enhances recognition and migration of T cells to tumor cells, and increases the cytotoxicity 2 to 4 times for T cells against different kinds of tumor cells. Surprisingly, based on this strategy, the T cells even exhibit similar cytotoxicity with the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell against Raji cells in vitro at the effector: target cell ratios (E:T) of 1:1. Such a universal bio-orthogonal T cell-targeting strategy might further broaden applications of T cell therapy against tumors and provide a new strategy for T cell modification.",Preliminary evidence from a prospective DTI study suggests a posterior-to-anterior pattern of recovery in college athletes with sports-related concussion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566282,Brain and behavior,2019 05 01,"We compared the integrity of white matter (WM) microstructure to the course of recovery in athletes who sustained one sports-related concussion (SRC), assessing individual longitudinal changes in WM fiber tracts following SRC using pre- and post-injury measurements.",Age-specific clinical characteristics and outcome in patients over 60 years old with large hemispheric infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566281,Brain and behavior,2019 05 01,We aimed to investigate age-specific clinical characteristics in patients aged >60 years with large hemispheric infarction (LHI).,Fluorescing Isofunctional Ribonucleosides: Assessing Adenosine Deaminase Activity and Inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566279,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,2019 04 18,"The enzymatic conversion of isothiazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-based adenosine (tz A) and 2-aminoadenosine (tz 2-AA) analogues to the corresponding isothiazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-based inosine (tz I) and guanosine (tz G) derivatives is evaluated and compared to the conversion of native adenosine to inosine.

PDI binds to αIIb β3 integrin on activated platelets, and potentiates activation of this integrin through the C-terminal CGHC active-site motif. How PDI binds to platelet αIIb β3 is unknown. Objective and methods We used PDI domain fragments and full-length PDI containing point mutations to study inhibition of Alexa 488-labeled PDI binding to thrombin-activated platelets. The effect of the PDI variants on platelet aggregation was tested. Results Only PDI fragments containing the b' domain bound to activated platelets. A double mutant of the b' domain had decreased binding, confirming the essential role of the b' domain. Addition of mutations in the a and a' domains further decreased binding, suggesting that these domains contribute to the interaction of PDI with platelets. The ability of the b' domain to interact directly with αIIb β3 was demonstrated with surface plasmon resonance, with contributions from the a and a' domains. The abb'x PDI fragment that binds to platelets but lacks the critical C-terminal active site inhibited platelet aggregation and in vivo thrombosis. Moreover, site mutations in the a, b' and a' domains that resulted in partial binding to platelets partially recovered aggregation of PDI-null platelets. PDI mutants that did not bind showed no recovery. Conclusion PDI functionally interacts with αIIb β3 on platelets through the substrate-binding b' domain, with the a and a' domains contributing to efficient binding."

Drawing on longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, the current investigation examined the extent to which money lending practices, feelings of financial resentment, and exposure to economic control contribute to couple-level interactions, and in turn, to conflict that escalates to the point of violence. Findings provide evidence of an association between adolescent financial behaviors and concurrent conflict due to economic considerations. Moreover, conflict due to economic considerations was an important predictor of future adolescent relationship abuse perpetration. We discuss the implications of our findings for intervention/prevention efforts.","Therapeutic potential of topically administered γ-AlOOH on 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis-like lesions in Balb/c mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566262,Experimental dermatology,2019 01 30,"Boehmite (γ-AlOOH) has a wide range of applications in a variety of industrial and biological fields. However, little is known about its potential roles in skin diseases. The current study investigated its effect on atopic dermatitis (AD). Following characterization, cytotoxicity, pro-inflammatory response and oxidative stress associated with boehmite were assessed, using TNF-α-induced keratinocytes and mast cells. In addition, therapeutic effects of boehmite, topically administered to Balb/c mice induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), were evaluated. Expression of cytokines (TLSP, IL-25 and IL-33) and the generation of ROS from keratinocytes induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by boehmite without affecting cell viability. MAPKs (ERK, JNK and p38) required for cytokine expression were suppressed by boehmite treatment. Up-regulation of cytokines (TSLP, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES) in human mast cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore was also suppressed by boehmite. Boehmite improved the AD severity score, epidermal hyperplasia and transepidermal water loss in DNCB-induced AD-like lesions. Moreover, Th2-mediated cytokine expression, mast cell hyperplasia and destruction of the skin barrier were improved by boehmite treatment. Overall, we demonstrated that boehmite may potentially protect against AD.",Impact of an auditory hallucinations simulation on trainee and newly qualified clinical psychologists: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566261,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,2019 06 04,"Simulation training is an effective teaching tool enabling learners to gain a subjective understanding of a range of skills. Our aim in this study was to pilot and evaluate a newly designed simulation of auditory hallucinations as a future training tool for clinicians. This was a mixed-methods study in two parts. In Phase 1, trainee and qualified clinical psychologists (N = 25) attended the London-based immersive art exhibition, Altered States of Consciousness, which included an auditory hallucinations simulation. The exhibition aimed to improve understanding of what it feels like to hear voices by providing members of the public with an individualized simulation of auditory hallucinations. Participants completed pre/post-exhibition measures of their mood and attitudes towards auditory hallucinations and other unusual sensory experiences. In Phase 2, a subgroup of Phase 1 participants (N = 15) took part in a semi-structured interview and completed the post-exhibition questions again approximately 6 months later. Post-exhibition, there were significant increases in understanding what it feels like to hear voices (large effect), compassion towards people who hear voices (large effect), and comfort talking to people who hear voices (medium effect). Scores were partially maintained at follow-up. Participants reported that the simulation provided numerous benefits to their training and clinical practice, including increases in subjective understanding, compassion, and confidence, and suggested several future training applications for the simulation, including with a range of health care professionals. Therefore, we conclude that this simulation has potential for training clinical psychologists and other health care professionals who work with people who experience auditory hallucinations.",Detection of circulating HPV16 DNA as a biomarker in the blood of patients with human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566259,Head & neck,2019 02 20,"Development of biomarker analysis using the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methodology is a challenge for noninvasive cancer diagnosis.

Certain strains of Staphylococcus (S) aureus are vicious pathogens that cause deleterious effects in host cells and tissues. Both secreted toxins and structural components of S. aureus trigger an immune response, though how S. aureus stimulates host immune responses is poorly understood. We explored here how keratinocytes and fibroblasts initiate the first steps of an immune response by activating dendritic cells (DCs) through recognition of structural components of S. aureus. We treated monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (moLCs) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) with conditioned media from keratinocytes (K-CM) and fibroblasts (F-CM) treated with heat-killed S. aureus (HKSA) respectively, or directly with HKSA. Immune and inflammatory responses from keratinocytes, fibroblasts, moLCs and moDCs were assessed by analysis of cell surface markers and cytokine production using flow cytometry, real-time PCR and ELISA assays. K-CM and F-CM increased the expression of CD86 and HLA-DR on moLCs and moDCs, in association with a specific cytokine profile. K-CM upregulated TNFA, IL-1B and GM-CSF mRNA expression in moLCs, while F-CM upregulated IL-12 and downregulated TNFA and TGFB mRNA expression in moDCs. Additionally, F-CM attenuated the induction of an inflammatory profile in monocytes. The recognition of structural components from S. aureus by cutaneous microenvironment induces the activation and the expression of specific cytokines from LCs and DCs.",Regulation of Kit Expression in Early Mouse Embryos and ES Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566254,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2019 02 27,"Kit is a growth factor receptor that regulates proliferation and/or survival of many embryonic and postnatal stem cell types. When mutated, it can induce malignant transformation of the host cells. To dissect the Kit role in the control of ESC pluripotency, we studied its expression during early mouse embryogenesis and during the process of ESC derivation from inner cell mass (ICM) cells. We followed the in vitro development of early mouse embryos obtained from transgenic mice carrying Kit promoter regions fused to EGFP (Kit-EGFP) and found that they initiate EGFP expression at morula stage. EGFP expression is then maintained in the blastocyst, within the ICM, and its levels increase when cultured in the presence of MAPK and GSK3β inhibitors (2i) plus LIF compared with the LIF-only condition. Kit-EGFP ESCs showed nonhomogeneous EGFP expression pattern when cultured in LIF condition, but they upregulated EGFP expression, as well as that of Sox2, Nanog, Prdm14, when shifted to 2i-LIF culture. Similarly, primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the process of embryonic germ cell (EGC) conversion showed enhanced EGFP expression in 2i-LIF. Kit expression was affected by manipulating Sox2 levels in ESCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Sox2 binds Kit regulatory regions containing Sox2 consensus sequences. Finally, Kit constitutive activation induced by the D814Y mutation increased ESC proliferation and cloning efficiency in vitro and in teratoma assays in vivo. Our results identify Kit as a pluripotency-responsive gene and suggest a role for Kit in the regulation of ESC proliferation.

The exposure-response analysis was performed with data from 1 phase 2 and 3 phase 3 studies in hepatitis C virus-infected subjects. The probability of liver-related laboratory elevations were modeled using linear logistic regression. Selected covariates were tested using a forward-addition and backward-elimination approach. The final model for ALT elevation included Asian race, body weight in non-Asian subjects, and asunaprevir exposure. The final model for Tbili elevation included Asian race, fibrosis score (F0-F3 or F4) and asupanprevir exposure.

Subjects with F4 fibrosis score had a higher rate of Grade 3 or 4 Tbili elevation compared to subjects with F0 to F3 fibrosis score. Higher asunaprevir exposure was associated with increases in Grade 3 or 4 ALT and Tbili elevation rates; however, the impact on the ALT elevation was not clinically relevant and the effect on Tbili elevation was smaller than the other significant covariates.",Anti-EF-Tu IgG titers increase with age and may contribute to protection against the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566236,European journal of immunology,2019 05 07,"Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a pathogen that commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of preschool children, causing opportunistic infections including acute otitis media (AOM). Patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are persistently colonized with NTHi and occasionally suffer from exacerbations by the bacterium leading to increased morbidity. Elongation-factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu), a protein critical for bacterial protein synthesis, has been found to moonlight on the surface of several bacteria. Here, we show that antibodies against NTHi EF-Tu were present in children already at 18 months of age, and that the IgG antibody titers increased with age. Children harboring NTHi in the nasopharynx also displayed significantly higher IgG concentrations. Interestingly, children suffering from AOM had significantly higher anti-EF-Tu IgG levels when NTHi was the causative agent. Human sera recognized mainly the central and C-terminal part of the EF-Tu molecule and peptide-based epitope mapping confirmed similar binding patterns for sera from humans and immunized mice. Immunization of BALB/c and otitis-prone Junbo (C3H/HeH) mice promoted lower infection rates in the nasopharynx and middle ear, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that IgG directed against NTHi EF-Tu may play an important role in the host immune response against NTHi.",Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566235,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 05 22,"Studies report that up to 80% of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may struggle with symptoms of depression. However, this major comorbidity in COPD is rarely managed effectively. A number of recent studies indicate that left untreated, COPD-related depression is associated with worse quality of life, worse compliance with COPD treatment plan, increased exacerbations, hospital admissions, and healthcare costs when compared to individuals with COPD without depression. Regrettably, COPD practice guidelines do not provide conclusive treatment recommendations for the use of antidepressants in patients with COPD, and base their guidelines on findings from trials in the general population. This may be problematic, as there is an elevated risk of respiratory issues associated with antidepressant treatment and COPD. Evaluating effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions specifically for patients with COPD and depression was therefore paramount.","To reflect human autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid peroxidase (not thyroglobulin) antibodies should be measured in female (not sex-independent) NOD.H2h4 mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566234,Clinical and experimental immunology,2019 04 01,"NOD.H2h4 mice are the most commonly used model for human autoimmune thyroiditis. Because thyroid autoimmunity develops slowly (over months), NOD.H2h4 mice are usually exposed to excess dietary iodide to accelerate and amplify the process. However, unlike the female bias in human thyroid autoimmunity, autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (TgAb) are reported to be similar in male and female NOD.H2h4 . We sought evidence for sexual dimorphism in other parameters in this strain maintained on regular or iodized water. Without iodide, TgAb levels are higher in males than in females, the reverse of human disease. In humans, autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are a better marker of disease than TgAb. In NOD.H2h4 mice TPOAb develop more slowly than TgAb, being detectable at 6 months of age versus 4 months for the latter. Remarkably, unlike TgAb, TPOAb levels are higher in female than male NOD.H2h4 mice on both regular and iodized water. As previously observed, serum T4 levels are similar in both sexes. However, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are significantly higher in males than females with or without iodide exposure. TSH levels correlate with TgAb levels in male NOD.H2h4 mice, suggesting a possible role for TSH in TgAb development. However, there is no correlation between TSH and TPOAb levels, the latter more important than TgAb in human disease. In conclusion, if the goal of an animal model is to closely reflect human disease, TPOAb rather than TgAb should be measured in older female NOD.H2h4 mice, an approach requiring patience and the use of mouse TPO protein.",A Longitudinal Study on Stability and Transitions Among Bullying Roles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566232,Child development,2018 12 19,Trajectories of stability and change in bullying roles were examined through a longitudinal prospective study of 916 school students followed up biannually from age 11 to 17. Perpetrators and victims had relatively stable trajectories with most of the children remaining in the same role over time or becoming uninvolved. Bully/victim was the most unstable role with frequent transitions to perpetrators or victims. Developmental change in bullying roles was found with a decrease in physical forms over time in bullies and victims but with persistently high perpetration and victimization in bully/victims. These findings open new horizons in research and practice related to bullying and can be useful for its early detection or design of targeted interventions.,Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response Analyses for CPX-351 in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566230,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 04 16,"CPX-351, a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin at a synergistic ratio, is approved in the United States for adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. Population pharmacokinetics analyses were performed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling on pooled data from 3 clinical studies, and the impact of CPX-351 exposures on efficacy and safety was assessed. The pharmacokinetics of cytarabine and daunorubicin were described using 2-compartment models with linear elimination. None of the evaluated covariates had a clinically significant impact on plasma exposure to total cytarabine or daunorubicin, while bilirubin and formulation showed statistically significant effects on pharmacokinetic parameters of cytarabine and daunorubicin, respectively. In patients with mild/moderate renal impairment or serum bilirubin ≤3 mg/dL, plasma exposures to cytarabine and daunorubicin following CPX-351 were within the variability range for patients with normal kidney function or serum bilirubin levels. Exposure-response analysis demonstrated that better efficacy outcomes were associated with higher CPX-351 exposure quartiles. Early mortality rates in all CPX-351 exposure quartiles were lower vs the 7 + 3 control group, and lower mortality rates were associated with higher exposure quartiles. A trend toward greater frequency of grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (but not grade 4/5 events) was observed at higher CPX-351 exposure quartiles. Overall, the population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate no adjustments to the recommended dose and schedule of CPX-351 are warranted for patients with mild/moderate renal impairment or serum bilirubin ≤3 mg/dL. Results from the exposure-response analyses suggest the current CPX-351 regimen provides a favorable risk-benefit profile.","Detection of Mansonella ozzardi among blood donors from highly endemic interior cities of Amazonas state, northern Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566229,Transfusion,2019 03 06,"In the Brazilian Amazon, the filarial nematode Mansonella ozzardi co-exists with malaria parasites and thick blood smear microscopy is considered the diagnostic gold standard.

In particular, a one-pot multi-segment condensation method, with only one purification step to obtain the final product, is expected to demonstrate unique benefits in chemical protein synthesis, such as the requirement of fewer handling procedures and the higher efficiency in obtaining aimed protein samples. The utilization of the one-pot multi-segment condensation strategy is demonstrated via the synthesis of a series of post-translational modification (PTM) or disease-associated peptides or proteins for basic and advanced scientific research. This review summarizes the recent one-pot multi-segment condensation methods utilized in chemical protein synthesis, in which two aspects of drive-strategies will be mainly included: a kinetically controlled strategy and a protecting group-removal strategy, respectively. On one hand, the activities of peptides in N-terminal thiol amino acids or C-terminal acyl donors can be largely different based on the differences in properties, such as steric hindrance, migration rates, electrophilicity, and introduction of active elements such as selenium, etc. Using the different activities, regio-selective peptide ligation can be performed in a kinetically controlled manner. On the other hand, the protecting group-removal strategy involves various moieties, which can block the activity of functional groups arising from N-terminal thiol amino acids or C-terminal acyl donors, and they can be removed by using additives, and pH- or photo-stimulation conditions with further achievement of chemical protein synthesis by the one-pot strategy.",Photophysics of perylene monoimide-labelled organocatalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566162,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 02 15,"We designed and synthesized cinchona alkaloid derivates PMI-BnCPD, 1 and PMI-dHQD, 2, in which a fluorescent perylene monoimide unit is linked to the quinuclidine fragment.

Herein, we target this fundamentally important issue, shedding light on the ""POM-counterion-solvent"" and ""POM-counterion-solvent-substrate"" processes. We effectively combine the results from small-angle X-ray scattering in solution with surface sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and present on this basis a semi-quantitative analysis which provides an excellent correlation between both approaches. The MeCN-solution speciation of a tris(alkoxo)-ligated Wells-Dawson-type polyoxoanion - explored as a representative of commonly negatively charged POM-based inorganic-organic nanostructures - is strikingly connected with the growth of porous two-dimensional molecular layers on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).

It is found that the nanochannel-confined block copolymers self-assemble into a family of intrinsically chiral architectures, which serve as structural scaffolds to direct the chiral arrangement of nanoparticles. Through calculations of chiral order parameters and simulations of discrete dipole approximation, it is further demonstrated that certain members of this family of nanoparticle assemblies exhibit intense chiroptical activity, which can be tailored by the nanochannel radius and the nanoparticle loading.

We investigate the use of electroosmotic (EO) pumping as a mechanism for dynamic control of capillary flow in paper-based devices. The applied voltage can accelerate or decelerate the baseline capillary-driven velocity, as well as be used to create a tunable valve that reversibly switches the flow on and off in an electrically controlled manner. The method relies on simple fabrication and allows repeated actuation, providing a high degree of flexibility for automation of liquid delivery. We adapt the Lucas-Washburn model to account for EO pumping and provide an experimentally validated analytical model for the distance penetrated by the liquid as a function of time and the applied voltage. We show that the EO-pump can reduce filling time by 6.5-fold for channels spanning several cm in length, relative to capillary filling alone. We demonstrate the utilization of the EO-pump for a tunable and dynamic flow control that accelerates, decelerates and stops the flow on demand.

Here, we made an effort to provide a comprehensive understanding of Cu regulation of the selectivity of HIF-1α binding across the genome. We used tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), a Cu selective chelator, to reduce Cu content in the cells. We conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to globally map the binding sites of HIF-1α, RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and the acetylation at the 27th lysine residue of the histone H3 protein (H3K27ac). We also performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in EA.hy926 cells under hypoxia (1% O2) with or without Cu depression to determine the profile of mRNA expression. Our analyses identified 3197 HIF-1α binding sites under hypoxia. Cu depression by TEPA reduced the number of binding sites to 1820 from the original 3197, but induced 274 new binding sites. We analysed these binding sites in the promoter and putative enhancer regions, coupled with their mRNA expression profiles, and found 281 Cu-dependent and 10 Cu-independent HIF-1α target genes. We found that the core bases ""GGAA"" and ""TTCC"" constituted the critical motifs for the binding sites of Cu-dependent genes. This study thus revealed that Cu, by affecting the binding of HIF-1α to the critical motifs in the promoter and putative enhancer regions of HIF-1 regulated genes, leads to the selectivity of HIF-1 regulated expression of Cu-dependent genes.",A scalable filtration method for high throughput screening based on cell deformability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566156,Lab on a chip,2019 05 08,"Cell deformability is a label-free biomarker of cell state in physiological and disease contexts ranging from stem cell differentiation to cancer progression.

The key innovation in this method is that we design customized arrays of individual filtration devices in a standard 96-well format using soft lithography, which enables multiwell input samples and filtrate outputs to be processed with higher throughput using automated pipette arrays and plate readers. To validate high throughput filtration to detect changes in cell deformability, we show the differential filtration of human ovarian cancer cells that have acquired cisplatin-resistance, which is corroborated with cell stiffness measurements using quantitative deformability cytometry. We also demonstrate differences in the filtration of human cancer cell lines, including ovarian cancer cells that overexpress transcription factors (Snail, Slug), which are implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; breast cancer cells (malignant versus benign); and prostate cancer cells (highly versus weekly metastatic). We additionally show how the filtration of ovarian cancer cells is affected by treatment with drugs known to perturb the cytoskeleton and the nucleus.

Like many hydrolysable tannins, geraniin is water-soluble and readily undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of hot water, weak acids and weak bases to yield several metabolites including corilagin (CO), ellagic acid (EA) and gallic acid (GA). There are numerous studies on the pharmacological effectiveness of GE, CO and GA. However, the intestinal permeability of GE and CO has never been investigated before. Caco-2 cell transport assay was utilized to evaluate the in vitro permeability of GE and its metabolites. GE, CO and EA were found to have no apparent permeability (Papp) while GA displayed a Papp value of 31.3 ± 1.1 × 10-6 cm s-1. Mass balance studies showed a loss of geraniin and its metabolites during transport. Chemical stability studies in the transport buffers revealed that GE and CO were hydrolyzed in the HBSS buffers. Experiments using lysed cells revealed that GE and its metabolites were metabolized during transport. Absorption and desorption studies confirmed the accumulation of EA inside the cells. The above results indicate that the compounds have poor oral absorption.

Receptor models of factor analysis with nonnegative constraints (FA-NNC) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) were employed to recognize the potential emission sources, which suggested an association with the production processes in the nearby industrial park.

Herein, we present this fluorescent silica nanoparticle as an excellent sensing material towards vapor phase PETN, making contributions to many fields such as public security and military use.",Heavy carbon nanodots 2: plasmon amplification in Quanta Plate™ wells and the correlation with the synchronous scattering spectrum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566140,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 03 05,"Brominated carbon nanodots are a new carbon nanostructure that exhibits strong phosphorescence without fixation. Herein we report plasmonic amplification of this phosphorescence in silver-coated Quanta Plate™ wells, a technique called metal-enhanced phosphorescence (MEP). Subsequently we correlate the excitation and emission components of brominated carbon nanodots to their respective enhancement values. These properties are then discussed in relation to the synchronous scattering spectrum of the plasmonic substrate, in the first report of its kind for MEP. These results set the foundation for expanded application of carbon nanodots, as the photophysical characteristics of phosphorescence are improved, and augment the growing understanding of MEP.",Bulky cationic β-diketiminate magnesium complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566138,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 29,"Cationic β-diketiminate Mg complexes with the bulky tBuBDI ligand and the weakly coordinating anion B(C6F5)4- have been prepared by the reaction of (tBuBDI)MgnBu with [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]-; tBuBDI = CH[C(tBu)N-Dipp]2 and Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl. Their structures are compared to the previously reported cationic (MeBDI)Mg+ complexes; MeBDI = CH[C(Me)N-Dipp]2. Crystallization of [(tBuBDI)Mg]+[B(C6F5)4]- from chlorobenzene gave a unique (tBuBDI)Mg+·ClC6H5 cation with a rather short MgCl and consequently long C-Cl bond. Crystallization from chlorobenzene/arene solvent mixtures gave (tBuBDI)Mg+·arene complexes (arene = benzene, toluene, m-xylene) but in the presence of mesitylene the chlorobenzene complex was formed. Due to the greater shielding of the metal, none of these complexes display Mg(F5C6)4B- interactions. Crystal structures of the arene complexes show in all cases η2-coordination of the arene ligands. Ring slippage from a more favorable η2-coordination can be explained by the steric bulk of the tBuBDI ligand. The smaller arenes, benzene and toluene, also bind to (tBuBDI)Mg+ in bromobenzene solution. The Lewis acidity of these cationic Mg complexes was determined by the Gutmann-Beckett test. The acceptor number for (tBuBDI)Mg+ (AN = 76.0) is substantially higher than that estimated for (MeBDI)Mg+ (AN = 70.3). Calculation of the atomic NPA charges by DFT shows that the Mg2+ ion in (tBuBDI)Mg+ is slightly more positively charged than the metal in (MeBDI)Mg+, confirming its higher Lewis acidity. The lower benzene complexation energy calculated for (tBuBDI)Mg+versus (MeBDI)Mg+ is due to steric congestion of the metal in the (tBuBDI)Mg+ cation which allows only for Mg(η1)C6H6 instead of Mg(η6)C6H6 bonding. This ring slippage, however, results in a significant polarization of the electron density in the benzene ring, making it susceptible for nucleophilic attack.",A novel fluorescence method for activity assay and drug screening of T4 PNK by coupling rGO with ligase reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566137,The Analyst,2019 05 27,"T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) is the primary member of the 5'-kinase family that can transfer the γ-phosphate residue of ATP to the 5'-hydroxyl group of oligonucleotides. In this article, using the differential quenching ability of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) towards the fluorophore-labeled DNA probe, we propose a novel method for detecting T4 PNK activity assisted by ligase reaction. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit of T4 PNK was estimated to be 0.0002 U μL-1 in the linear region of 0.001 U μL-1-0.1 U μL-1. Additionally, the developed method was used to screen regulators of T4 PNK from natural compounds. The compound f isolated from the root of Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Smith was found to stimulate T4 PNK activity in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. Finally, the method was used to monitor the relation of T4 PNK activity with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The results demonstrated that the development of this disease could inhibit T4 PNK activity to some extent. In summary, the above data indicate that the method not only provides a universal platform for monitoring T4 PNK activity, but also shows great potential to be used in drug screening and clinic diagnosis.",The adhesion energy measured by a stress accumulation-peeling mechanism in the exfoliation of graphite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566136,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 17,"The mechanical exfoliation of graphite using tape is one way to obtain high-quality graphene samples. However, the amount of graphene obtained is negligible due to the unclear exfoliation mechanism. In this paper, we present a stress accumulation-peeling mechanism, which can be applied to measure the adhesion energy of graphite. This mechanism is different from a wriggle or a creep. First, we obtained a simple universal formula to measure the adhesion energy Ga = (Fmax-Fmin)/3b, where Fmax and Fmin are the maximum and minimum values, respectively, of the external stretch force in the peeling process, and b is the width of the peeling arm. Second, the reliability of the method was demonstrated by measuring the adhesion energy between polydimethylsiloxane and glass. Using the simple universal formula, the adhesion energies of three graphite slices were determined to be 0.34 ± 0.03, 0.33 ± 0.06 and 0.34 ± 0.02 J m-2. These adhesion energies were consistent with the other measured result of 0.33 J m-2, which was based on the self-retraction phenomenon of graphite. The macroscopic method is very simple and easy to implement. It can be used to measure the adhesion energy of any van der Waals material and any biomaterial with adhesion interaction, as well as prepare excellent 2D material samples by optimizing the experimental conditions.",Nanoscale fracture of defective popgraphene monolayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566135,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 17,"A new carbon allotrope, namely popgraphene, has been recently demonstrated to possess high potentials for nanodevice applications. Herein, the fracture of defective popgraphene was studied using molecular dynamics simulations and continuum modeling. Three scenarios of defects were considered, including an individual point defect, distributed point defects, and nanocracks. It was found that the fracture stress of popgraphene with an individual point defect was governed by both the geometry of the defect and the critical bond where fracture initiates. Moreover, the fracture stress of popgraphene with distributed point defects was discovered to be inversely proportional to the defect density, showing a nice linear trend. Furthermore, for popgraphene with a nanocrack, it failed in a brittle fashion and exhibited a negligible lattice trapping effect. The Griffith criterion was subsequently employed with the consideration of crack deflection to accurately predict the dependence of fracture stress on crack size. The present study lays a mechanistic foundation for nanoscale applications of popgraphene and offers a better understanding of the roles of defects in fracture of low-dimensional materials.","Fast beam photofragment translational spectroscopy of the phenoxy radical at 225 nm, 290 nm, and 533 nm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566134,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2018 12 19,"Photodissociation of the phenoxy radical (C6H5O) is investigated using fast beam photofragment translational spectroscopy. Phenoxy radicals are generated through photodetachment of phenoxide anions (C6H5O-) at 532 nm. Following photoexcitation of the radicals at 225 nm (5.51 eV), 290 nm (4.27 eV), or 533 nm (2.33 eV), photofragments are collected in coincidence to determine their masses, translational energy, and scattering angle for each dissociation event. Two-body dissociation yields exclusively CO + C5H5, and three-body dissociation to CO + C2H2 + C3H3 and CO + C5H4 + H is also seen at the two higher energies. The translational energy distributions for two-body dissociation suggest that dissociation occurs via internal conversion to the ground electronic state followed by statistical dissociation. The absorption of an additional 532 nm photon in the photodetachment region provides some C6H5O radicals with an additional 2.33 eV of energy, leading to much of the two-body dissociation observed at 533 nm and the three-body dissociation at the two higher excitation energies."

Extensive experimental efforts have been carried out to explore the structure-function relatioship of these two elusive oxidants, however, controversial proposals based on these experimental results and the missing mechanistic details call for the interplay of a theoretical approach with these existing experimental ones, especially for the factors that tune the chemical equilibrium between the two oxidants 1 and 2. Herein, density functional calculations have been performed and the results demonstrated that the effect of triflate counterions (OTf) is not the well known axial ligand effect. Instead, it works via a novel halogen bond interaction. This halogen bond interaction not only increases the reaction rate of reversible reactions, but it also makes the equilibrium point shift to the direction of the metal-iodosylarene oxidant, compared with the non-halogen bond case. An experimentally observed species with a signal of S = 5/2 was identified as an OTf-halogen-bonding iron(iii)-iodosylbenzene species. The substituent effects of iodoarenes were also studied and the results show that the more fluorine substitution, the higher the reaction barrier and the smaller the amount of metal-iodosylarene oxidant in the oxidation system.

Results show that adding water treatment residual has optimal removal rates for total phosphorus (TP) (median = 96.80%) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (median = 97.13%). The water reduction rates of the columns with improved fillers are 1.23-2.04 times that of the bioretention soil media column. The coconut chaff column has the best water storage capacity (median = 40.54%). Among the external factors affecting column operation, influent concentration of pollutants in urban surface runoff is the biggest influence factor on the removal efficiency of TP. However, there are no significant correlations between the removal efficiency of SRP and rainfall, influent concentration, and discharge ratio. The columns modified with medical stone, vermiculite, peat soil, medical stone + peat soil, green zeolite + peat soil all have good removal for phosphorus pollutant.

The results of this study demonstrate that the ECSB design seems to be particularly suitable to treat calcium-rich wastewater that is probably due to the fact that in this system CaCO3 precipitates in the bulk liquid of the external circulation tank and not the biomass present in the main reactor, and that the CaCO3 crystals are washed-out from it due to the high upflow velocity applied to the system (5 m h-1).",Performance comparison of uninsulated and insulated hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor (HABR) operating at warm temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566092,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 05 07,"In this research, a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor (HABR) configuration was proposed consisting of a front sedimentation chamber and four regular baffled chambers followed by two floated filter media chambers for the treatment of domestic wastewater.

To accomplish this, two identical continuously stirred anaerobic digesters (CSADs) were operated in parallel at mesophilic conditions. We also included anaerobic settlers to mimic the full-scale plant and to accomplish sludge recycling. We fed fresh, thickened sludge to both setups once every other day, but performed the Fenton reaction with only the experimental system by adding H2O2 to the recycled biosolids from the anaerobic settler. We observed very large fluctuations in biogas production due to ever-changing characteristics of the thickened sludge both on a daily and seasonal basis. Regardless, the two setups performed almost identically with: 1) chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies of 63.8 ± 2.9% and 62.1 ± 3.2%; and 2) biogas productivities of 0.280 and 0.279 L CH4·g-1 volatile solids for the experimental (with Fenton) and control (without Fenton) CSADs, respectively.

Here, we compared the antiviral activity of SERINC3 and SERINC5 among mice, rats and rabbits, and their susceptibility to viral counteraction to their human counterparts. In the absence of viral antagonists, rodent and lagomorph SERINC3 and SERINC5 displayed anti-HIV activity in a similar range to human controls. Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped virions were considerably less sensitive to restriction by all SERINC3/5 orthologs. Interestingly, HIV-1 Nef, murine leukemia virus (MLV) GlycoGag and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) S2 counteracted the antiviral activity of all SERINC3/5 orthologs with similar efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the antiviral activity of SERINC3/5 proteins is conserved in rodents and rabbits, and can be overcome by all three previously reported viral antagonists.","Flavobacterium hydrophilum sp. nov. and Flavobacterium cheongpyeongense sp. nov., isolated from freshwater.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566071,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019 05 02,"Two Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, yellow-pigmented bacterial strains, designated IMCC34758T and IMCC34759T, were isolated from freshwater.

These inhibitors can reactivate latent HIV-1 to produce non-infectious viruses. The mechanism underlying reduced infectivity of reactivated viruses is unknown. In this study, we analysed PI-reactivated viruses using biochemical and virological assays and demonstrated that these PIs stabilized the cellular expression of HIV-1 restriction factor, APOBEC3G, facilitating its packaging in the released viruses. Using infectivity assay and immunoblotting, we observed that the reduction in viral infectivity was due to enhanced levels of functionally active APOBEC3 proteins packaged in the virions. Sequencing of the proviral genome in the target cells revealed the presence of APOBEC3 signature hypermutations. Our study strengthens the role of PIs as bifunctional LRAs and demonstrates that the loss of infectivity of reactivated HIV-1 virions may be due to the increased packaging of APOBEC3 proteins in the virus.","Pseudomonas sichuanensis sp. nov., isolated from hospital sewage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566068,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019 05 14,"A bacterial strain, designated WCHPs060039T, was isolated from hospital sewage in China.

Right he is to communicate to the larger audience for which he is writing this principal fruit of by now almost a century of professional history-of-science writing - a deep-seated awareness that every scientific view or finding, even if looking timeless in retrospect, has emerged from some given historical context that shows us where the scientist in question started, and that helps explain how, and in what direction, they managed to venture beyond the original context.

Due to practical and economic factors, early modern cartography was a conservative practice based on source compilation and comparison. For the Pacific region especially, the paucity of first-hand observations and the conflicting nature of those observations rendered the world's largest ocean difficult to chart and prone to the retention of mythical continents, passages and islands. After a discussion of the practical and economic reasons why geographic features were difficult to revise on maps, the article focuses on a case study to show how geographic enigmas could be placed and persist. It will use Pepys Island to illustrate the ways in which a chimeric feature could become instilled in geographic parlance.","Imperial vernacular: phytonymy, philology and disciplinarity in the Indo-Pacific, 1800-1900.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566065,British journal for the history of science,2019 01 08,"This essay examines how Indo-Pacific indigenous plant names went from being viewed as instruments of botanical fieldwork, to being seen primarily as currency in anthropological studies. I trace this attitude to Alexander von Humboldt, who differentiated between indigenous phytonyms with merely local relevance to be used as philological data, and universally applicable Latin plant names. This way of using indigenous plant names underwrote a chauvinistic reading of cultural difference, and was therefore especially attractive to commentators lacking acquaintance with any indigenous language or culture. When New Zealand anthropologists embraced this role for Māori phytonyms in the 1890s, however, they did so possessed of a relatively in-depth understanding of Māori culture and the Māori language. This discussion has three primary aims: to illuminate nineteenth-century scholarly engagements with Indo-Pacific plant classifications, in contrast to a prevailing historiographical emphasis on European disregard for this subject; to analyse how indigenous phytonyms acted as 'boundary objects' interfacing between cultures and disciplines; and to illustrate the politics of scientific disciplinarity in a colonial context.","The 'genie of the storm': cyclonic reasoning and the spaces of weather observation in the southern Indian Ocean, 1851-1925.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566064,British journal for the history of science,2019 01 08,"This article engages with debates about the status and geographies of colonial science by arguing for the significance of meteorological knowledge making in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Mauritius. The article focuses on how tropical storms were imagined, theorized and anticipated by an isolated - but by no means peripheral - cast of meteorologists who positioned Mauritius as an important centre of calculation in an expanding infrastructure of maritime meteorology. Charles Meldrum in particular earned renown in the mid-nineteenth century for theoretical insights into cyclone behaviour and for achieving an unprecedented spatial reach in synoptic meteorology. But as the influx of weather data dried up towards the end of the century, attention turned to developing practices of 'single-station forecasting', by which cyclones might be foreseen and predicted not through extended observational networks, but by careful study of the behaviour of one set of instruments in one place. These practices created new moral economies of risk and responsibility, as well as a 'poetry', as one meteorologist described it, in the instrumental, sensory and imaginative engagement with a violent atmospheric environment. Colonial Indian Ocean 'cyclonology' offers an opportunity to reflect on how the physical, economic and cultural geographies of an island colony combined to produce spaces of weather observation defined by both connection and disconnection, the latter to be overcome not only by infrastructure, but also by the imagination.",A hard nut to crack: nutmeg cultivation and the application of natural history between the Maluku islands and Isle de France (1750s-1780s).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566063,British journal for the history of science,2019 01 08,"One of France's colonial enterprises in the eighteenth century was to acclimatize nutmeg, native to the Maluku islands, in the French colony of Isle de France (today's Mauritius). Exploring the acclimatization of nutmeg as a practice, this paper reveals the practical challenges of transferring knowledge between Indo-Pacific islands in the second half of the eighteenth century. This essay will look at the process through which knowledge was created - including ruptures and fractures - as opposed to looking at the mere circulation of knowledge. I argue that nutmeg cultivation on Isle de France was a complex process of creolizing expertise originating from the local populations of the plants' native islands with the horticultural knowledge of colonists, settlers, labourers and slaves living on Isle de France. In this respect, creolization describes a process of knowledge production rather than a form of knowledge. Once on Isle de France, nutmeg took root in climate and soil conditions which were different from those of its native South East Asian islands. It was cultivated by slaves and colonists who lacked prior experience with the cultivation of this particular spice. Experienced horticulturalists experimented with their own traditions. While they relied on old assumptions, they also came to question them. By examining cultivation as an applied practice, this paper argues that the creolization of knowledge was a critical aspect in French colonial botany."

Nuclear membrane rupture allows uncontrolled exchange between nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. Local tensile stresses can also cause nuclear deformations, but whether such deformations are accompanied by nuclear membrane rupture is unknown. Here we used a direct force probe to locally deform the nucleus by applying a transient tensile stress to the nuclear membrane. We found that a transient (∼0.2 s) deformation (∼1% projected area strain) in normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A cells) was sufficient to cause rupture of the nuclear membrane. Nuclear membrane rupture scaled with the magnitude of nuclear deformation and the magnitude of applied tensile stress. Comparison of diffusive fluxes of nuclear probes between wild-type and lamin-depleted MCF-10A cells revealed that lamin A/C, but not lamin B2, protects the nuclear membranes against rupture from tensile stress. Our results suggest that transient nuclear deformations typically caused by local tensile stresses are sufficient to cause nuclear membrane rupture.",High Variability in Neuronal Loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566036,Stroke,2018 12 24,"Background and Purpose- In the setting of acute ischemic stroke because of large-vessel occlusion (LVO) there is progressive loss of brain tissue which occurs in a time-dependent fashion previously quantified to be ≈1.9 million neurons per minute. However, this number represents an average and accumulating evidence suggests large individual variation. In this study, we aim to quantify the distribution and range in the rate of loss brain tissue across the entire spectrum of clinical phenotypes of anterior circulation LVO strokes encountered in clinical practice. Methods- Retrospective review of a prospectively acquired database of consecutive patients with anterior circulation stroke because of proximal LVO and appropriate ischemic core imaging was performed. Ischemic core volume was measured using automated software processing and time from last known well to imaging was recorded. Applying previously published methodology for brain loss quantification, we computed rate of brain tissue elements loss in proximal LVO stroke patients. Results- We studied 415 patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) occlusion. Mean ischemic core volume was 50.4 mL and mean time to imaging from time from last known well (TLKW) was 8.7 hours, which is similar to previously published data, translates into a mean loss per minute of 2.03 million neurons, 14.8 billion synapses, and 12.8 km of myelinated fibers. However, the distribution of neuron loss was highly variable, ranging from <35 000 to >27 million cells per minute. Conclusions- Widely spread rates of infarct growth are observed in acute ischemic stroke because of proximal LVO with rate of neuron loss per minute ranging from <35 000 per minute in slow progressors to >27 million per minute in fast progressors, with a mean and median of 2 million and 0.9 million, respectively.",Intraischemic Modest Hypothermia Does Not Prevent Onset of Locomotor Inactivity After Transient Forebrain Ischemia in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566035,Therapeutic hypothermia and temperature management,2018 12 19,"Although modest hypothermia of 35°C has been demonstrated to provide histological neuroprotection in a rodent model of cerebral ischemia, the long-term behavioral outcome is still not clear. This study was designed to investigate whether modest hypothermia of 35°C provides sustained histological and behavioral neuroprotection following transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: sham, control, and modest hypothermia group. Each group contained eight rats. Ten-minute transient forebrain ischemia was produced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion plus hemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial pressure = 40 mmHg). The hypothermic group was cooled to 35°C in preischemic period, and the cooling was continued for 1 hour postischemia. To evaluate behavioral outcome, spontaneous alternation behavior and locomotor activity were assessed using Y-maze test on a weekly basis. The rats were sacrificed after 28 days, and the number of intact neurons per 1 mm in the hippocampal CA1 subfield was counted microscopically. There was significant difference between the control [19(24.5)/mm: median (interquartile range)] and hypothermia groups [116(24)/mm; p < 0.01] in the intact CA1 neuron count. In the control and modest hypothermia groups, the locomotor activities were gradually decreased, and reached significantly lower levels in comparison with the sham group at 14 days postischemia.

These collectives can also be reconfigured, allowing for adaption to new tasks. Larger collectives are more robust and more capable, but the size of existing collectives is limited by the cost of individual units. In this article, we present a soft, modular robot that we have explicitly designed for manufacturability: Linbots. Linbots use multifunctional voice coils to actuate linearly, to produce audio output, and to sense touch. When used in collectives, the Linbots can communicate with neighboring Linbots allowing for isolated behavior as well as the propagation of information throughout a collective.

In the first phase we measured SBT as soon as possible after admission (t0) and 10 minutes later (t10). In the second phase we measured SBT and changes of SBT after local cooling of different regions in the maintenance phase of targeted temperature management. We included six patients to each phase of the study. In the first phase, we observed lower SBT compared with core body temperature (CBT) at t0 and t10, with nonsignificant differences in head and axillary region at t0 (35.2°C ± 1.3°C vs. 36°C ± 0.6°C, p = 0.11, and 35.7°C ± 1.4°C vs. 36°C ± 0.6°C, p = 0.41, respectively) and head at t10 (34.8°C ± 1.6°C vs. 35.9°C ± 0.6°C, p = 0.13). SBT in all other body regions at t0 and t10 was significantly lower compared with CBT (all p values <0.05).

Tendon-driven catheters, owing to their continuum structure, are applied in minimal invasive surgeries such as intracardiac interventions. However, due to the intrinsic nonlinearities and external disturbances, it is still a challenging task to accurately steer the catheter tip to the desired 3D positions. In this article, we proposed a new probabilistic kinematic model and a model-based three-dimensional position control scheme for a tendon-driven cardiac catheter. A dynamic Gaussian-based probabilistic model is developed to learn a mapping from the catheter states to the control actions. Based on the probabilistic model, a closed-loop position control is developed, in which the catheter is driven by a newly designed catheter driver system and tracked by a multiple near-infrared camera system. The proposed catheter framework is evaluated by the 3D trajectory tracking experiments both in a real 3D open space and in a minimum-energy-based simulator. The proposed control framework approximates the general kinematic by a combination of a catheter translation model and a distal workspace model, which provides the ability of automatically positioning the catheter tip in 3D and improving the accuracy by compensating the learned nonlinear effects.",DjA1 maintains Golgi integrity via interaction with GRASP65.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566031,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 06 10,"In mammalian cells, the Golgi reassembly stacking protein of 65 kDa (GRASP65) has been implicated in both Golgi stacking and ribbon linking by forming trans-oligomers. To better understand its function and regulation, we used biochemical methods to identify the DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 1 (DjA1) as a novel GRASP65-binding protein. In cells, depletion of DjA1 resulted in Golgi fragmentation, short and improperly aligned cisternae, and delayed Golgi reassembly after nocodazole washout. In vitro, immunodepletion of DjA1 from interphase cytosol reduced its activity to enhance GRASP65 oligomerization and Golgi membrane fusion, while adding purified DjA1 enhanced GRASP65 oligomerization. DjA1 is a cochaperone of Heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (Hsc70), but the activity of DjA1 in Golgi structure formation is independent of its cochaperone activity or Hsc70, rather, through DjA1-GRASP65 interaction to promote GRASP65 oligomerization.

Recent studies have shown that a variety of enteric pathogens are able to colonize plant surfaces by forming biofilms and thereby persist for long periods, which can subsequently lead to human infections. Therefore, biofilm formation by enteric pathogens on plants poses a risk to human health. Here, we deciphered the roles of YcfR in biofilm formation by Salmonella enterica. YcfR is a putative outer membrane protein associated with bacterial stress responses. The lack of YcfR facilitated the formation of multicellular aggregates on cabbage leaves as well as glass surfaces while reducing bacterial motility. ycfR deletion caused extensive structural alterations in the outer membrane, primarily in lipopolysaccharides, outer membrane proteins, cellulose, and curli fimbria, thereby increasing cell surface hydrophobicity. However, the absence of YcfR rendered Salmonella susceptible to stressful treatments, despite the increased multicellular aggregation. These results suggest that YcfR is an essential constituent of Salmonella outer membrane architecture and its absence may cause multifaceted structural changes, thereby compromising bacterial envelope integrity. In this context, YcfR may be further exploited as a potential target for controlling Salmonella persistence on plants."
