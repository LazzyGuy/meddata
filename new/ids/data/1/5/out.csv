Concentrated leachate, containing high concentrations of pollutants, is an important type of secondary pollution produced in MSW incineration power plants and requires proper treatment. In this study, various coagulants were used to treat concentrated leachate from a nanofiltration (NF) membrane that treated leachate from an MSW incineration plant. The optimal coagulation condition was determined in this study. Under the optimal condition, removals of chemical oxygen demand, light absorbing substances (at 254 nm), total nitrogen, color and turbidity were 68.42%, 69.01%, 44.14%, 92.31% and 87.44%, respectively. Much of the refractory organic matter with relatively high molecular weight, aromaticity and humification degree was removed, and effluent had a lower molecular weight than raw NF concentrated leachate. Study also found that some parts of high molecular weight compounds from NF CL were removed by coagulation process, but the change of distribution of molecular weight was not outstanding. The NF concentrated leachate, both before and after coagulation, contained a large amount of chloride. Hence, a follow-up study should be conducted to find an effective additional processing that can remove organic matter using the high concentration of chloride in the NF concentrated leachate coagulation effluent. This study provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of concentrated leachate from MSW incineration power plants.","Comparing three Australian natural organic matter isolates to the Suwannee river standard: Reactivity, disinfection by-product yield, and removal by drinking water treatments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176223,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Water treatments that provide efficient removal of organic and inorganic disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors across variable natural organic matter (NOM) sources are desirable. Treatments that effectively remove inorganic DBP precursors such as bromide, which significantly shift the speciation of DBP formation towards more toxic DBPs, are of particular interest and have been less investigated. This study characterised NOM isolated from three major drinking water sources in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia, and compared it to the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) Suwannee River NOM isolate (SR) in terms of DBP precursor removal treatments and DBP formation. Each NOM isolate was used to make synthetic water samples with otherwise identical water quality parameters, that were treated with enhanced coagulation (EC) or EC followed by; anion exchange (MIEX® resin), powdered activated carbon (PAC), granular activated carbon (GAC) or silver impregnated activated carbon (SIAC), to investigate the removal of DBP precursors (bromide and DOC), minimisation of DBPs, as well as the change in specific chlorine demand. EC/SIAC treatment was the most effective method of DBP control studied, due to the efficient simultaneous NOM and bromide adsorption of the SIAC (99 ± 1% bromide removal regardless of NOM source). This treatment also resulted in >92% removal of each of the measured DBPs across all NOM sources, with the exception of DBAN and 1,1-DCP, which achieved >80% removal across all NOM sources. Increases in tribromomethane (TBM) and dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN) formation were observed after all other treatment/NOM-isolate combinations, due to increased Br:DOC ratio after treatment, whereas chlorinated DBPs were generally well-controlled by all treatment/NOM-isolate combinations. Differences in reactivity of the individual NOM isolates were found to be related to both the origin of the isolate and the treatment employed, however, bromide removal capacity for each treatment was independent of NOM source.",Return flows from beaver ponds enhance floodplain-to-river metals exchange in alluvial mountain catchments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176222,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"River to floodplain hydrologic connectivity is strongly enhanced by beaver- (Castor canadensis) engineered channel water diversions. The hydroecological impacts are wide ranging and generally positive, however, the hydrogeochemical characteristics of beaver-induced flowpaths have not been thoroughly examined. Using a suite of complementary ground- and drone-based heat tracing and remote sensing methodology we characterized the physical template of beaver-induced floodplain exchange for two alluvial mountain streams near Crested Butte, Colorado, USA. A flowpath-oriented perspective to water quality sampling allowed characterization of the chemical evolution of channel water diverted through floodplain beaver ponds and ultimately back to the channel in 'beaver pond return flows'. Subsurface return flow seepages were universally suboxic, while ponds and surface return flows showed a range of oxygen concentration due to in-situ photosynthesis and atmospheric mixing. Median concentrations of reduced metals: manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and arsenic (As) were substantially higher along beaver-induced flowpaths than in geologically controlled seepages and upstream main channel locations. The areal footprint of reduced return seepage flowpaths were imaged with surface electromagnetic methods, indicating extensive zones of high-conductivity shallow groundwater flowing back toward the main channels and emerging at relatively warm bank seepage zones observed with infrared. Multiple-depth redox dynamics within one focused seepage zone showed coupled variation over time, likely driven by observed changes in seepage rate that may be controlled by pond stage. High-resolution times series of dissolved Mn and Fe collected downstream of the beaver-impacted reaches demonstrated seasonal dynamics in mixed river metal concentrations. Al time series concentrations showed proportional change to Fe at the smaller stream location, indicating chemically reduced flowpaths were sourcing Al to the channel. Overall our results indicated beaver-induced floodplain exchanges create important, and perhaps dominant, transport pathways for floodplain metals by expanding chemically-reduced zones paired with strong advective exchange.",Evaluating the potential of topsoil magnetic pollution mapping across different land use classes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176221,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Soil magnetic measurements are used increasingly to estimate the impact of airborne, combustion-related particulate matter (PM) pollution in dense measurement grids. Although many studies have proven the potential of topsoil magnetic measurements in environmental monitoring, their application is not straightforward when factors such as parent material or land use have to be accounted for. Often, the influence of land use on the soil magnetic signal is circumvented by targeting forest soils, where deposited magnetic particles are best preserved in the topsoil. However, when large forests are absent, e.g. in densely populated areas or environments with more heterogeneous land use, this approach often impedes reliable and comprehensive spatial sampling. We evaluated if topsoil magnetic pollution mapping across different land use classes, against a homogeneous geological environment of sandy soils, could help increase the spatial reliability of results in regional scale surveys. Although detailed magnetic property analysis and evaluation of trace metal concentrations in soils on arable land, forest and pasture showed the impact of atmospheric pollution, topsoil susceptibility measurements did not allow delineating the magnetic footprint of PM pollution. Land use strongly influenced the distribution of magnetic particles through soil, and the evaluation of anomalous magnetic topsoil enhancement required the integration of downhole susceptibility soundings. We conclude that topsoil susceptibility mapping remains a useful tool to evaluate PM pollution impact, yet its application potential across land use classes is limited.","Metal bioaccumulation, oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in oysters Crassostrea gasar transplanted to an estuary in southern Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176220,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The present study assessed the spatial and temporal variations on metal bioaccumulation and biochemical biomarker responses in oysters Crassostrea gasar transplanted to two different sites (S1 and S2) at the Laguna Estuarine System (LES), southern Brazil, over a 45-days period. A multi-biomarker approach was used, including the evaluation of lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels, and antioxidant defense enzymes (CAT, GPx, GR and G6PDH) and phase II biotransformation enzyme (GST) in the gills and digestive gland of oysters in combination with the quantification of Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, Fe, Ni and Zn in both tissues. The exposed oysters bioaccumulated metals, especially Al, Cd and Zn in gills and digestive gland, with most prominent biomarker responses in the gills. Results showed that GPx, GR and G6PDH enzymes offered an increased and coordinated response possibly against metal (Zn, Ni, Cd and Cu) contamination in gills. GST was inversely correlated to Cd levels, being its activity significantly lowered over the 45-d exposure periods at S2. On contrary, in digestive gland GST was slightly positively correlated to Cd, revealing a compensatory mechanism between tissues to protect oysters' cells against oxidative damages, since MDA levels also decreased. CAT also appeared to be involved in the cellular protection against oxidative stress, being increased in gills. However, CAT was negatively correlated to Al levels, which might suggest a possible inhibitory effect of this metal in the gills of C. gasar. Differences between tissues were evident by the Integrative Biomarker Responses version 2 (IBRv2) indexes, which showed different pattern between tissues when studying the sites and exposure periods separately. This study provided evidence for the effectiveness of using a multi-biomarker approach in oyster C. gasar to monitor estuarine metal pollution.",Suspended particles enhance biodegradation of oil in sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176219,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Biodegradation patterns of oil in four distinct phases were compared over a 14-day series of exposures. The dispersibility and stability of oil droplets in the water column were important factors affecting oil biodegradation. Due to the stability of oil droplets with particle interactions, oil-suspended particulate matter aggregates (OSAs) showed a five-fold enhancement in biodegradation compared to non-dispersed oil. The reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbons was highest in OSAs (51.45%), followed by chemically dispersed oil (33.5%), oil film (21.6%), and water-accommodated fractions (WAF, 14.3%). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) profiles and percentage weathering plots showed that reductions in PAHs in WAF, oil film, and chemically dispersed oil were mainly due to evaporation (41.5-69.5%) and only partially due to biodegradation (7.4-16.3%). However, the reduction of PAHs in OSAs was driven more by biodegradation (36.8%) than evaporation (29.7%). The strong PAH-particle interactions in OSAs inhibited evaporation of PAHs and enhanced microorganism biodegradation in the water column.",Physiological responses of Chlorella pyrenoidosa to 1-hexyl-3-methyl chloride ionic liquids with different cations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176218,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Ionic liquids (ILs) are massively used in multiple fields of industry, and consequently, they have entered the environment and become potential threats to the respective ecosystems. In this paper, the toxicity of two different cationic types of ILs (1-hexyl-3-methyl pyridine chloride ([C6Py]Cl) and 1-hexyl-3-methyl imidazole chloride ([C6MIM]Cl)) to Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa) was investigated. Growth inhibition increased with increasing ILs concentrations. C. pyrenoidosa showed a certain recovery at low ILs concentrations, the growth inhibition decreased from 6.13% to 1.57% of the control from 24 h to 96 h, respectively, in 0.5 mg/L [C6MIM]Cl treatment. However, growth inhibition was negatively related with exposure time at high concentrations, and the strongest toxic effects were observed after 48 h. The IC50 values (half inhibitory concentration) were 8.47, 6.65, 6.91 and 7.11 mg/L of [C6MIM]Cl, respectively, in 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and were 9.05, 6.83, 7.79 and 8.14 mg/L of [C6Py]Cl, respectively. Chlorophyll content declined with higher concentrations of the ILs. The values of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters: the maximum effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), maximum quantum yield in PSII (Fv/F0), and photosynthetic efficiency in PSII (Y(II)), decreased, whereas the minimal fluorescence (F0) increased following the ILs treatment, indicating damage to the photosystem II. [C6MIM]Cl and [C6Py]Cl caused deformation of algae cells, plasmolysis, and damage of the cell membrane and cell wall, and affected organelle structure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations increased with higher ILs concentrations from, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activity first increased and then decreased, indicating that the antioxidant defense system was activated to counteract ROS. ROS was the main stress in C. pyrenoidosa induced by ILs, and compared with [C6Py]Cl, [C6MIM]Cl were more toxic to C. pyrenoidosa.",Occurrence and human exposure assessment of perfluorinated substances in house dust from three European countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176217,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"65 house dust samples from three European countries (Belgium, Italy and Spain) were evaluated for the presence of 20 polyflouroalkyl substances (PFASs) including perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (PFOSAs). The three countries presented similar PFAS levels ranging from 3.13 to 155 ng/g (12.9 ng/g; median), but in all cases PFCAs concentrations (6.92, 15.2 and 8.68 ng/g; median for Belgium, Italy and Spain) were higher than those obtained for PFSAs (2.30, 1.76 and 2.68 ng/g). Interestingly, in comparison to previously published data exhibited an increase in perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) concentrations in Belgian house dust. On the other hand, levels of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) decreased in Spanish case. Data were examined for relationships between PFAS house dust levels, building and outdoor surrounding characteristics and occupant habits. Main findings revealed a positive association between PFOS concentrations and the building edification age, which could highlight a decrease in the use of this chemical in Europe. Similarly, perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) levels correlated with the percentage of the floor covered by textiles. Homes located in industrial sites showed higher PFCA levels compared to urban or agricultural locations, revealing the industrial processes as a potential source of these chemicals in Europe. Data obtained were used to perform human exposure assessment for dust intake via oral ingestion. Estimated daily intakes, calculated for toddlers and adults at median and worst case scenarios, were below oral Reference Dose (RfD) and tolerable daily intakes (TDI). However, in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) case, dust ingestion significance to total dietary exposure reached values of 51% for toddlers in the worst case scenario.","Comparing the disrupting effects of short-, medium- and long-chain chlorinated Paraffins on cell viability and metabolism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176216,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"With the phasing out of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs), the production and emissions of medium- and long-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs and LCCPs) are expected to increase. In this study, cell viability assay and pseudotargeted metabolomics approach were adopted to define and compare the toxic effects induced by SCCPs, MCCPs and LCCPs. The dose response curves indicated that three CP mixtures with comparable chlorine contents produced similar inhibitory effects on cell viability. At exposure concentration of 100 μg/L, three CP mixtures all induced significant increases in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and a significant reduction in level of adenosine triphosphate production (ATP), and produced similar impact intensities on overall metabolism. A stronger perturbation in phospholipid and fatty acid metabolism was observed in all CP exposure groups. In comparison with SCCPs and MCCPs, LCCPs produced a stronger suppressive effect on amino acid transport across cell membrane and induced an opposite effect on purine metabolism. Furthermore, the toxicity mechanism and possible health risks of the three types of CPs were discussed. MCCPs shared the most similar cytotoxicity and metabolic perturbation with SCCPs, suggesting that there should be concern about using MCCPs as alternatives to SCCPs.",Accumulation of heavy metals by wild edible mushrooms with respect to soil substrates in the Athens metropolitan area (Greece).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176215,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Six wild edible mushroom species, Agaricus bisporus, A. bitorquis, A. gennadii, Coprinus comatus, Psathyrella candolleana and Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, were collected from the Greater Athens area (Greece), together with their soil substrates (two depth-layers) for studying bioaccumulation of heavy metals in a densely populated urban environment. Total and bioavailable Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations in soils were assessed along with their respective concentrations in mushrooms, and were evaluated in conjunction with soil properties, including K, P and Na content, CaCO3 equivalent percentage, mechanical composition, pH and organic matter. In particular, Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni displayed a high variability in their total and bioavailable concentrations measured in the upper soil layer. Relatively high Pb and Ni contents were measured in mushrooms, while Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn concentrations varied considerably. No significant correlations were detected between total concentrations of heavy metals in soils and mushrooms, whereas bioavailable fractions for several metals were significantly correlated with their respective content in A. bisporus, C. comatus, P. candolleana and V. gloiocephalus. K, Na and P concentrations in soils were associated to the content of several metals in fruit-bodies. The effect of soil texture on metals accumulation by mushrooms was species-dependent since high correlations were found for V. gloiocephalus and C. comatus only. Interactions between metals content in fruit-bodies seem to be species-specific except for Ni vs. Fe and Mn vs. Fe, which are positively correlated in all cases. Overaccumulation of metals in fruit-bodies was established only in respect to the bioavailable fractions of Cu, Mn, Zn and Ni in soil. The levels of toxicity for Pb were exceeded in mushrooms of five species, whereas the rest of the heavy metals (with the exception of Cu) were detected at lower contents than their recommended dietary allowances or tolerable upper intake levels."

Results showed that under the same enzymatic hydrolysis conditions (2 mL enzyme/g biomass and 10% substrate loading), MgO-treated corn stover plus corn stover liquor had a similar glucose yield (70.4 vs. 68.8%) and concentration (40.4 vs. 41.5 g/L) but a higher xylose yield (56.6 vs. 25.3%) and concentration (16.7 vs. 10.6 g/L) compared with using MgO-treated corn stover only. Corn stover slurry from MgO pretreatment was near-neutral and free of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural, eliminating the need for washing and detoxification and lightening the burden for wastewater treatment. In addition, Tween 80 significantly reduced the irreversible binding of lignin to enzyme, increasing xylose and glucose yields by 14.7 and 6.2% and sugar concentration by 7.4 g/L, respectively.",Mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of soybean curd residue for methane production: Characterizing bacterial and methanogen communities and their correlations with organic loading rate and operating temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176202,Bioresource technology,2019 06 14,"To find the optimal operation parameters and provide an explanation of methanogenic pathway for methane production in mesophilic (35 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) anaerobic digestion (MAD, TAD) of soybean curd residue (SCR), MAD and MAD were contrastively investigated for 95 days. The maximum available OLR was identified as 3.3 gVS/L for both MAD and TAD. Compared to MAD, TAD exhibited a 20% higher average methane yield (0.591 L/gVS) and a 7.5% higher volatile solids removal efficiency (74.1 ± 10.4%). Bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated in MAD digesters while genus Defluviitoga was selectively enriched in TAD digesters due to higher temperature and organic loading pressure. Principal coordinates analysis of methanogen community showed that both temperature and OLR were crucial environmental variables shifting the taxonomic patterns of the methanogens. The enriched methanogen genus Methanothermobacter (93%) with a hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway had a close correlation with the TAD performance.",Enhanced adsorption of Pb(II) onto modified hydrochar: Modeling and mechanism analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176201,Bioresource technology,2019 06 14,"A highly efficient modified hydrochar material by H2O2 and ultrasonic synergistic treatment was prepared for Pb2+ removal in aqueous solution. The removal mechanism was investigated by a number of techniques and was provided by quantitative calculation. The maximum adsorption capacity of Pb2+ by the modified hydrochar was calculated to be 92.80 mg g-1 at pH 5.0 and 298 K, which was more than 42 times higher than pristine hydrochar (2.20 mg g-1) and much higher than the other reported modified hydrochar materials. The characterization results showed that H2O2 treatment changed elemental composition, surface charge and increased oxygen-containing functional groups of the hydrochar. The mechanism study indicated that complexation with free carboxyl and hydroxyl and cation-π interaction were main mechanisms responsible for Pb2+ sorption and their corresponding contribution percentage of different mechanisms to the Pb2+ sorption was accounting for 62.12%, 27.14% and 10.74%, respectively.",Inducible overexpression of zebrafish microRNA-722 suppresses chemotaxis of human neutrophil like cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176200,Molecular immunology,2019 06 14,"Neutrophil migration is essential for battling against infections but also drives chronic inflammation. Since primary neutrophils are terminally differentiated and not genetically tractable, leukemia cells such as HL-60 are differentiated into neutrophil-like cells to study mechanisms underlying neutrophil migration. However, constitutive overexpression or inhibition in this cell line does not allow the characterization of the genes that affect the differentiation process. Here we apply the tet-on system to induce the expression of a zebrafish microRNA, dre-miR-722, in differentiated HL-60. Overexpression of miR-722 reduced the mRNA level of genes in the chemotaxis and inflammation pathways, including Ras-Related C3 Botulinum Toxin Substrate 2 (RAC2). Consistently, polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell migration and generation of the reactive oxygen species are significantly inhibited upon induced miR-722 overexpression. Together, zebrafish miR-722 is a suppressor for migration and signaling in human neutrophil like cells.",AID preferentially targets the top strand in nucleosome sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176199,Molecular immunology,2019 06 14,"AID initiates both somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in Ig genes. AID-induced mutations are linked with transcription initiation and elongation. Transcription occurs in the context of chromatin and thus RNA PolII and AID need to deal with nucleosomes. Both nucleosome stability and positioning significantly influence the accessibility of AID to Ig genes and the SHM pattern. Interestingly, in the nucleosome, SHM process seems to have a preference for the top strand. To know whether the preferential targeting of SHM to the top strand is due to a post-AID event, we expressed an inhibitor of Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), Ugi, into DT40 cells containing the nucleosome positioning sequence (MP2) and compared the SHM pattern. We observed a similar preference to the top strand for the high-affinity nucleosome positioning sequence in UNG inhibited cells. Furthermore, to understand whether the primary sequence of nucleosome sequence is influencing preferential targeting, we introduced two copies of MP2 sequence in the reverse orientation (MP2R) into a variable Ig gene. We observed that the MP2R cells also demonstrated preferential targeting of the non-transcribed strand in nucleosome as compared to the transcribed strand, confirming that in nucleosome sequences AID has better access to Cs on the top strand. The preferential targeting of AID on the top strand suggests that RNA Pol-II stalls while it transcribes the stable nucleosomes, thus giving ample opportunity for the transcribed strand to form R-loops with the nascent RNA, thereby gives limited access to AID on the bottom strand.",Emodin ameliorates rheumatoid arthritis by promoting neutrophil apoptosis and inhibiting neutrophil extracellular trap formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176198,Molecular immunology,2019 06 14,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, synovitis-based inflammatory disease with unknown etiology. Neutrophils play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA. Apoptosis and NETosis of neutrophils are two major mechanisms of programmed cell death that differ in their morphological characteristics and effects on the immune system. In rheumatoid arthritis, delayed neutrophil apoptosis amplifies the inflammatory response; and massive release of NETs and their components may cause tissue damage and provide self-antigens. Emodin is a natural anthraquinone derivative that occurs in many widely used Chinese medicinal herbs. In this study, we evaluated the effect of emodin on a murine adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model of RA in vivo and on neutrophil apoptosis and NETosis in vitro. Our results show that emodin alleviated AA by reducing neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-α) release. Emodin promoted apoptosis and inhibited autophagy and NETosis in neutrophils. These findings indicate that emodin represents a potential therapeutic agent for RA.",An innovative method to visualise mastoiditis using a hand-held X-ray system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176196,International journal of paleopathology,2019 06 13,We explore the utility of using a hand-held X-ray system to diagnose mastoiditis in archaeological populations.,Effect of baseline hypocalcaemia on volume of intracerebral haemorrhage in patients presenting within 72 hours from symptom onset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176195,Journal of the neurological sciences,2019 06 13,Calcium has a pivotal role in haemostasis.

While studies have been previously conducted to describe relationships between physical vulnerability and features about building properties, the immediate environment and event intensity proxies, several key challenges remain. In particular, observations, especially those associated with high magnitude events, and studies designed to evaluate a comprehensive range of predictive features are both limited. To build upon previous developments, we described a workflow to support the continued development and assessment of empirical, multivariate physical vulnerability functions based on predictive accuracy. Within this workflow, we evaluated several statistical approaches, namely generalized linear models and their more complex alternatives. A series of models were built 1) to explicitly consider the effects of dimension reduction, 2) to evaluate the inclusion of interaction effects between and among predictors, 3) to evaluate an ensemble prediction method for applications where data observations are sparse, 4) to describe how model results can inform about the relative importance of predictors to explain variance in expected damages and 5) to assess the predictive accuracy of the models based on prescribed metrics. The utility of the workflow was demonstrated on data with characteristics of what is commonly acquired in ex-post field assessments. The workflow and recommendations from this study aim to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners in the natural hazards community.",Contribution of soil variables to bacterial community composition following land use change in Napahai plateau wetlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176182,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 16,"Land use changes have significant modifications on soil conditions, which is likely to induce alterations in the soil bacterial communities. Little is known about the respective contributions of soil variables to these changes in bacterial communities. For this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to measure the change in bacterial community compositions under the effects of soil variables across three land-use types (i.e., reference, degraded, and agricultural wetlands) in the Napahai plateau. Compared with the reference wetland, a pronounced decrease (1.5-5.3 times) in soil water content, soil organic matter, and total and available nitrogen was observed in degraded and agricultural wetlands. However, a conspicuous increase (1.3-5.7 times) was found for the total and available phosphorus, and potassium. Land use also strongly affected the taxonomic composition of soil bacterial assemblages, changing the normalized ratio of Acidobacteria to Proteobacteia, or to δ-proteobacteia. Soil properties had different contributions to the variations in abundance composition of bacterial community. Soil available phosphorus and potassium were the best predictors for changes in bacterial community composition, explaining 80.9% and 82% of the variations, respectively. In contrast, soil organic matter, carbon/nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total and available nitrogen accounted for 58.7-72.7% of the variations in bacterial community composition. Soil pH (24.6%) and soil water content (40.4%) had a minor contribution. Our data suggested that the compositional alterations of microbial communities following land-use change were likely realized through modifications in the availability of primary soil nutrients in the Napahai plateau wetlands.",Evaluation of a pilot-scale bio-trickling filter as a VOCs control technology for the chemical fibre wastewater treatment plant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176181,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"The performance of lab- and pilot-scale bio-trickling filters (BTFs) for the treatment of emissions from a chemical fibre wastewater treatment plant was investigated. These systems were installed mainly to demonstrate the effectiveness of bio-trickling technologies in purifying exhaust gases containing different kinds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Results showed that 12 days more were necessary for the pilot-scale BTF to start up successfully than the lab-scale one. Both the lab- and pilot-scale BTFs exhibited contaminant removal efficiency higher than 90% at an empty bed residence time of 59 s, corresponding to gas flow of 0.2 m3 h-1 and 550 m3 h-1, respectively. The reduction of the microelement in the nutrient solution had little effect on the performance of the pilot-scale BTF. The abundance and diversity of the microorganism analysis showed that the diversity of the contaminants had a significant influence on the microorganism distribution in the BTF. Economic feasibility study showed that BTF might be an efficient solution for VOCs control with a lower cost than adsorption technology and regenerative catalytic oxidation.",Enhancement of facultative anaerobic denitrifying communities by oxygen release from roots of the macrophyte in constructed wetlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176180,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"The radial oxygen loss (ROL) of wetland plants is a crucial factor that can influence the efficiency required for nitrogen (N) removal and microbial activities responsible for N removal in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, the shift of microbial community in different niches in response to ROL has been rarely studied. This study aims to unravel the link between the ROL and microbial response in sediment, water and rhizoplane by a surface flow CW planted with Myriophyllum aquaticum for treating high-strength swine wastewater. Ti3+-citrate colorimetric method demonstrated that M. aquaticum was a wetland species with a ROL of 0.019 mg/h/plant. Using quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA gene, we demonstrated that the abundance of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers in the rhizoplane was the most of the three niches, that in the water (5-10 cm) was the less and that in the sediment was the least. Acinetobacter was enriched and dominated amongst denitrifiers in the water. Denitrifiers in the rhizoplane were mainly dominated by enriched Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Acinetobacter. The theoretical calculation of oxygen sources and consumptions indicated that water reaeration should support the oxygen demands for nitrification in the aerobic layer (0-5 cm), and the ROL could stimulate the growth of facultative anaerobic denitrifiers in the rhizoplane and water (5-10 cm) to achieve denitrification within CW systems.",Composition and function of soil fungal community during the establishment of Quercus acutissima (Carruth.) seedlings in a Cd-contaminated soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176179,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"This study was designed to explore the functions of soil fungal communities in the Cd tolerance of Q. acutissima seedling. Three Cd levels of 15, 30, and 40 mg kg-1 were set up using the soils collected from Q. acutissima forests. The benomyl was applied to inhibit the fungal communities in the soil. Following a 100-day pot cultivation of Q. acutissima seedlings, the plant growth, Cd content, N uptake, and fungal communities were evaluated. The results showed that the root dry weights were significantly reduced after the benomyl addition at the Cd concentrations of 30 and 40 mg kg-1. Root fungi colonization was enhanced under higher Cd concentrations when soil fungi are present (without the benomyl treatment). The fungi associated with root increased the Cd accumulation in the roots while decreased the Cd transfer to the shoot at 40 mg Cd kg-1. The 15N enrichment in root tip was positively correlated with enzyme activities of soil catalase and urease. And the activities of acid phosphatase, catalase, and urease were inhibited at each Cd level. The abundance of the dominant fungal genus differed in their response to Cd contamination. The ectomycorrhizal fungi of Tomentella and Cortinarius were identified under the higher Cd levels (40 mg kg-1). Our results implied Tomentella and Cortinarius could be applied to enhance the capacity of Quercus acutissima in the bioremediation of Cd polluted soil.",Modelling micropollutant fate in sewer systems - A new systematic approach to support conceptual model construction based on in-sewer hydraulic retention time.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176178,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"Conceptual sewer models are useful tools to assess the fate of micropollutants (MPs) in integrated wastewater systems. However, the definition of their model structure is highly subjective, and obtaining a realistic simulation of the in-sewer hydraulic retention time (HRT) is a major challenge without detailed hydrodynamic information or with limited measurements from the sewer network. This study presents an objective approach for defining the structure of conceptual sewer models in view of modelling MP fate in large urban catchments. The proposed approach relies on GIS-based information and a Gaussian mixture model to identify the model optimal structure, providing a multi-catchment conceptual model that accounts for HRT variability across urban catchment. This approach was tested in a catchment located in a highly urbanized Italian city and it was compared against a traditional single-catchment conceptual model (using a single average HRT) for the fate assessment of reactive MPs. Results showed that the multi-catchment model allows for a successful simulation of dry weather flow patterns and for an improved simulation of MP fate compared to the classical single-catchment model. Specifically, results suggested that a multi-catchment model should be preferred for (i) degradable MPs with half-life lower than the average HRT of the catchment and (ii) MPs undergoing formation from other compounds (e.g. human metabolites); or (iii) assessing MP loads entering the wastewater treatment plant from point sources, depending on their location in the catchment. Overall, the proposed approach is expected to ease the building of conceptual sewer models, allowing to properly account for HRT distribution and consequently improving MP fate estimation.",A conceptual method to simultaneously inhibit methane and hydrogen sulfide production in sewers: The carbon metabolic pathway and microbial community shift.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176177,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"In this study, the impact of COD/SO42- ratio in sewage on methane and hydrogen sulfide production in sewer biofilms was investigated by using three identical lab-scale gravity sewer systems. The results showed that the COD/SO42- played a key role in the competition between methanogenic archaea (MA) and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). Both the lowest methane and hydrogen sulfide production were obtained at COD/SO42- ratio of 6. The carbon transformation revealed that the activity of both MA and SRB was inhibited at this COD/SO42- ratio. Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium were the two dominant MA, while Desulfonema, Desulfotomaculum and Desulfovibrio were the dominant SRB in this case. The specific SRB activity measured by batch tests proved that acetate was mainly degraded by the MA, while propionate was the preferred substrate for the SRB.",Assessment of heavy metal pollution from anthropogenic activities and remediation strategies: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176176,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 14,"Heavy metal pollution is a nefarious issue with implications for life. Heavy metals are natural occurring elements, having both natural and anthropogenic sources. The latter are however the most significant, releasing greater amounts of these pollutants in more toxic and mobile forms. Their chemistry and dynamics in the ecosystems are presented, and the relation to the pollution problematic thereof is discussed. The concentration of heavy metals in several sites, assessed in water, soil and sediment samples, affected by different pollution sources are reviewed. These evidence how human activities impact natural media and how the pollution spreads. The pollution in each media is assessed by the concentration relative to drinking and irrigation water guidelines, and by the geoaccumulation index of soils and sediments. It is found that ore extraction and processing and metallurgical industries stand atop the most polluting sources. Given the dynamics of heavy metal cations and that, most of these are released in liquid effluents, wastewater treatment techniques for the removal of heavy metals are also surveyed and critically discussed. Economic viability at a large municipal scale and the ability to comply with strict regulations are the determining factors in the selection of these techniques. A critical discussion on the viability of such techniques is made, reviewing some literature studies and commenting on their applicability on the previously found polluted media.",Protein phase separation in mitosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176175,Current opinion in cell biology,2019 06 12,"Through phase separation, some proteins form liquid-like condensates or droplets which can flow, fuse, and even deform when pressure is applied. In some cases, the condensates 'mature' to form gel or solid-like structure. Recent studies suggest that the liquid-like condensates form the structural basis for several membrane-less subcellular organelles such as stress granules and other subcellular structures. Here, we review and discuss studies that implicate protein phase separation in the function of the spindle apparatus and centrosomes.",Taxonomy and phylogeny of two poorly studied genera of marine oligotrich ciliates including descriptions of two new species: Cyrtostrombidium paraboreale sp. n. and Apostrombidium orientale sp. n.

In the present study, we investigate the oligotrich genera, Cyrtostrombidium and Apostrombidium, with emphasis on their morphology and evolutionary relationships. Three isolates were collected from coastal waters of northern and southern China including two new species, viz., Cyrtostrombidium paraboreale sp. n., Apostrombidium orientale sp. n., and Apostrombidium pseudokielum Xu et al., 2009. Cyrtostrombidium paraboreale sp. n. is characterized by possessing 64-98 cytopharyngeal rods and two macronuclear nodules. Apostrombidium orientale sp. n. is characterized by its somatic kinety consisting of five fragments including a horizontally orientated subterminal fragment and possessing conspicuously long dorsal cilia. Apostrombidium pseudokielum is redescribed based on the new population and a re-examination of the type material. Phylogenetic analyses were performed for the subclass Oligotrichia, incorporating SSU rRNA gene sequences of the three species investigated here. The results indicate that the genus Cyrtostrombidium is monophyletic with C. paraboreale sp. n. occupying the basal position. The genus Apostrombidium is not monophyletic as Varistrombidium kielum is nested within it."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 06 13,"Theoretical insights on the comparison between the champion dyes SM315 and C275 used for high-performance dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) reaching over 12% efficiency with different electron donors only (porphyrin for SM315 and indenoperylene for C275) were explored for the first time. The intrinsic reasons for the significantly improved monochromatic photon-to-electric current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of C275-based DSSCs over those of SM315 were revealed. According to our results, we find that the larger IPCE of C275 is attributed to its larger electronic coupling, smaller reorganization energy, reduced exciton binding energy and enhanced charge transfer character, all of which when combined lead to a larger electron injection efficiency. In addition, the larger Voc of C275 is due to a greater number of injected electrons, a smaller molecular volume and a smaller projected area, which lead to a more compact adsorption layer with a hindered charge recombination process. Thus, C275 is expected to have more potential to further optimize high-performance DSSCs. In view of the primary shortcoming of C275, which is its relatively narrow absorption spectrum, further optimization was made through structural modification using a series of heterocyclic anchoring groups. Using the same evaluation criteria, the theoretical screening of these dyes based on C275 is carried out. We find that indenoperylene dye with a barbituric acid (BA) anchoring group is a promising candidate for the experimental synthesis of high-performance DSSCs with improved Jsc, Voc and adsorption stability.","Molecular conformation, vibrational spectroscopic and NBO analysis of atenolol and atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide cocrystals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176161,"Spectrochimica acta.

The computed structural parameters were compared with the data obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. Chemical reactivity (electronegativity, electrophilicity, hardness, chemical softness and chemical potential) was predicted with the help of HOMO- LUMO energy values. Experimental FT-IR was recorded and the calculated values were also analyzed using the same level of DFT. A complete vibrational spectrum was made to analyze the potential energy distribution (PED). Stability of the molecule arising from hyperconjugative interaction was analyzed by the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. The molecular electrostatic potential map was used to detect the possible electrophilic and nucleophilic sites in ATN molecule. Cocrystallization of atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide (ATN-HCTZ) was performed and the structure was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction.

The binding constants (K) of complexes 1 and 2 for various PAHs are found to be in the order of 104 M-1 with a 1:1 binding mode, as determined from UV-vis absorption and emission spectral titration studies. 1H NMR spectral studies show that the chemical shifts of pyrene guest and the 1,4-NVP moiety of 2 are shifted up-field, whilst the alkoxy protons do not show any appreciable change in their chemical shifts.

Herein, the colorimetric sensor studies of this green synthesized Ag@AgCl-NPs showed an interesting feature for sensing of hazardous Hg2+ in water. The colorimetric assay is based on the concentration - dependent degradation of as-prepared Ag@AgCl-NPs in the presence of Hg2+.

The prepared polycrystal is opaque and single crystal is transparent. Under 980 nm excitation, upconversion spectra were investigated at different temperatures changed from 323 K to 773 K. It is found the deep red (3F2,3 → 3H6) and blue (1G4 → 3H6) or red (1G4 → 3F4) emissions of Tm3+ ions exhibit opposite temperature dependent behaviors, so their temperature sensing characteristics are studied.

As a consequence, the maximum relative sensitivity of about 0.7% K-1 is achieved based on the non-thermally coupled levels of Tm3+ ion in LiNbO3 crystals. The polycrystal reveals more excellent temperature sensing properties in low temperature, and single crystal is more suitable for high temperature application. Moreover, it is discovered the stability of FIR with different powers greatly depends on the concerned energy levels.

Spectra recording at different interval time while the reaction is proceeded, or at different pHs, or at different concentrations of complexing agent are examples of strategies by which one can generate second-order data by the spectrophotometric method. In this work, for the first time, we employed α-CD as an inclusion complexing agent under ultrasonic irradiation for simultaneous determination of gallic acid (GA) and vanillic acid (VA). UV spectra of a mixture of two analytes were recorded as a function of α-CD concentration. A calibration set containing 9 reference samples was used to construct model using bilinear least squares/residual bilinearization (BLLS/RBL) as second-order calibration method. The predictive ability of the resulting model was validated by a test set including 5 samples. Finally, the proposed model was successfully applied to simultaneously determine the content of GA and VA in five fruit juice samples. Satisfactory results in terms of the recovery yields were obtained. In a word, UV-spectroscopy coupled with a strategy to yield a second-order data in combination to second-order calibration methods has high potential to be a simple, quick and accurate analysis procedure for the determination of various types of chemical structures in practice.","Spectral studies of niflumic acid aggregation in dissolved, solid and adsorbed states.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176155,"Spectrochimica acta.

The effects of β-cyclodextrin concentration and Δ λ have been optimized for sensitive and selective analysis of EST and NOR binary mixture. Synchronous fluorescence intensity of the two drugs is measured at Δ λ of 70 nm. EST and NOR can be simultaneously determined at 230 nm and 270 nm, respectively. Calibration curves were linear over the ranges of 0.5-6.0 μg mL-1 and 0.2-2.0 μg mL-1 for EST and NOR, respectively.

These massive nanomachines often completely coat targeted microbes where they act as recruitment platforms for downstream effectors capable of direct bactericidal activity. GBP-containing platforms also serve as sensory hubs to activate inflammasome-driven responses in the mammalian cytosol while in plants like Arabidopsis, GBP orthologues may facilitate intranuclear signaling for immunity against invasive phytopathogens.

However, how land use change affects sediment export is still poorly understood. This study provided an integrated analysis of the relationships in a ""three-level"" chain linked as follows: ""land use change → changes in sediment source and sediment delivery → sediment export change"" for a better understanding. It used the InVEST sediment delivery ratio (SDR) model to analyze the Qiantang River Basin (4.27 ∗ 104 km2), China. Sediment export change was examined from the two perspectives: the effects of land use change on sediment source and on sediment delivery. Correlations between changes in individual land use types and changes in sediment source and sediment delivery were identified. The results indicated that sediment export reduced from 1.69 t ha-1 yr-1 in 1990 to 1.22 t ha-1 yr-1 in 2015 because of the decreased sediment source and a weakened sediment delivery function. In the study area, the conversions of cropland to urban land (urbanization) and bare land to forestland (afforestation) were found to make the major contributions to reductions in soil loss and SDR, respectively. Furthermore, soil loss change resulted in the decreases in total value of sediment export and SDR change caused a large-scale spatial change in sediment export. Our hotspot analysis revealed that the Wuxi River watershed should be targeted for priority conservation to optimize land use/cover for reducing sediment export. This study demonstrates the benefits of taking a comprehensive approach to analyze the processes associated with sediment export change. These allow to improve sediment management and promote aquatic ecosystem health by providing specific future land use recommendations, aimed at source treatment and delivery interception.",Genome-wide analysis of magnesium transporter genes in Solanum lycopersicum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176140,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 06 13,"Magnesium (Mg) is an important micronutrient for various physiological processes in plants. In this study, putative Magnesium Transporter (MGT) genes have been identified in Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum, Brachypodium distachyon, Fagaria vesca, Brassica juncea and were classified into 5 distinct groups based on their sequence homology. MGT genes are very diverse and possess very low sequence identity within its family. However, the Gly-Met-Asn (GMN) signature motif is present in most of the genes which are believed to be essential for Mg2+ recognition. In S. lycopersicum, different physiological root growth pattern was observed in both Mg excess and deficient conditions.

Studies so far have mostly described frequencies, yet surveys on its morphology and traumatology are missing. It is unknown to what extent this anatomical variant impacts the overall symmetry of the larynx. For the trauma reconstruction after cervical trauma this knowledge is required as an asymmetric larynx can show a different fracture pattern. In this investigation, larynxes with unilateral (n=21)/bilateral (n=5) agenesis of the upper thyroid horn(s) and a control group with regular larynxes (n=23) were juxtaposed. Various measurements were taken after μ-CT scanning. In total 10 distances/angles for the thyroid cartilage and 8 for the cricoid cartilage were compared. Using intra-individual and matched pair comparisons the symmetry was assessed. The results of this investigation showed significant differences in the intra-individual and pairwise comparison for the opening angle and the length of the thyroid alae although the lateral inclination of the thyroid alae showed no significant difference. Combining these three parameters into one symmetry score, the comparison was not significant. This research demonstrates that neither unilateral nor bilateral agenesis of the UTH is related to a structural disbalance of the larynx. Thus, different fracture patterns or vulnerabilities are not to be expected.",Non-metric traits and anatomical variants that can mimic trauma in the human skeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176138,Forensic science international,2019 06 14,"This paper presents some of the more commonly encountered non-metric traits and minor anatomical variants in the adult human skeleton that can mimic or be mistaken for trauma. Distinguishing non-metric traits is contingent upon both a knowledge of potential non-metric traits as well as the normal developmental timing, location, and anatomy of maturational markers in the human skeleton. Distinguishing non-metric traits from trauma in dry bone is an essential component in establishing an accurate and thorough forensic analysis of human remains, especially as it deals with antemortem and perimortem trauma, and postmortem damage.",Evidence for subjective emotional numbing following induced acute dissociation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176137,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 06 11,"The aim of the study was to examine the effects of acute dissociation on emotional responsivity in healthy individuals. We used a previously validated technique (mirror-gazing, Caputo, 2010) to experimentally induce acute dissociation in non-clinical participants and assessed post-induction subjective responsivity (ratings of valence and arousal) to standardized emotional images. Fifty non-clinical participants were randomised to either the dissociation induction (n = 25) or control conditions (n = 25). The dissociation manipulation effect was corroborated by a significant post-induction elevation in state dissociation in the dissociation-induction group relative to controls (p = .004). The dissociation-induction group rated negative (p = .028) and neutral (p = .025) stimuli as significantly less unpleasant than controls. There was also a non-significant trend for positive stimuli to be rated as less pleasant by the dissociation-induction group compared to controls (p = .060). These findings provide experimental evidence for the short-term alleviation (i.e., emotional numbing) of negative affect during dissociative states, which may serve as a coping mechanism for some individuals. However, this tendency of emotional numbing also reduced positive affective responses to pleasant stimuli to some extent. Further investigation of dissociative phenomena and their impact on emotional processing appears warranted.","Toward a transdiagnostic model of common and unique processes leading to the major disorders of childhood: The REAL model of attention, responsiveness and learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176136,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 06 11,"There is a growing recognition of the importance of identifying both trans-diagnostic risk factors across the major disorders that onset early in childhood, as well as precise vulnerabilities that differentiate among specific disorders. In this paper, we propose a model to explain individual differences in the development of the major forms of mental health problems that can be identified early in life through excesses and deficits in emotional attention, responsiveness and learning (i.e., the REAL model). The model leads to a number of specific hypotheses relating to trans-diagnostic (common to all disorders) and specific risk to the major mental disorders of childhood. Like earlier models of temperament, the REAL constructs are defined in terms of how the child responds to environmental conditions. Our proposal is that the development of psychopathology is in part based on how adverse environmental conditions trigger, inhibit, and interact with these specific biological vulnerabilities at sensitive periods in the developing human. To illustrate this interplay of biology and experience, we summarize key findings from the growing field of epigenetics and child mental health, arguing that epigenetic processes might mediate the relationship between environmental adversity and the major neurodevelopmental systems of REAL. Finally, we argued that the REAL model highlights important avenues for early intervention based on common and unique factors across childhood disorders.",An investigation of approach behaviour in Prolonged Grief.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176135,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 06 11,"Prolonged Grief (PG) is recognized as a potentially debilitating post-bereavement syndrome. Theoretical models of PG highlight the importance of both approach and avoidance behaviours in maintaining the syndrome. Research to date has focussed primarily on investigating avoidance in response to loss reminders. Comparatively few studies have indexed approach behaviours in PG. We use a quasi-experimental paradigm to simultaneously examine approach and avoidance behaviours to reminders of the deceased. Fifty-five bereaved individuals with and without PG responded to stimuli showing the deceased's name, an attachment figure's name, a neutral name, or a letter string, by pulling or pushing a joystick according to a whether the stimuli was a word or not. Concurrent visual feedback created the illusion that the images were either approaching or receding from the participant. Participants with PG were quicker to pull than push the three name stimuli, with quicker pulling of the deceased and attachment name than the neutral name. Non-PG participants responded more quickly to the attachment name but evidenced no relative approach or avoidance of any stimuli. Findings provide behavioural evidence about approach behaviour in PG, and are discussed with references to models that recognise the role of yearning for the deceased in PG.","Obesity, subliminal perception and inhibition: Neuromodulation of the prefrontal cortex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176134,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 06 11,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in food choice, and may be partly dysfunctional in obesity - a condition linked to altered attention and inhibition processes, particularly in response to food-related stimuli. We investigated the role of the PFC in subliminal visual processing and response inhibition to food pictures using anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a sample of 53 normal weight, overweight, or obese participants. Subliminal processing was measured with a breaking continuous flash suppression task (bCFS), and inhibition with a Go/No-Go task. BMI was included in the analyses as a continuous predictor. Higher BMI was associated with prolonged subliminal processing for both food and nonfood pictures in the bCFS task, and with longer RTs in food Go trials in the Go/No-Go task. Therefore, higher BMI was associated with an attentional bias for food images during supraliminal, but not subliminal visual processing. Moreover, anodal tDCS resulted in shorter detection times in the bCFS task, especially in participants with higher BMI. We conclude that anodal tDCS affects subliminal perception and attentional processes, and speculate that these effects may explain previous reports of reduced craving and food intake after anodal tDCS.","Temporal variations of perfluoroalkyl substances partitioning between surface water, suspended sediment, and biota in a macrotidal estuary.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176133,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"A one-year monitoring study was conducted in a macrotidal estuary to assess the temporal variations and partitioning behavior of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and invertebrates including zooplankton (copepods, mysids) and shrimps were sampled on a monthly basis in the Gironde Estuary (SW France). Environmental parameters such as suspended solid loads, salinity, and river water flow rate were highly variable at the study site. However, moderate seasonal variations were observed in terms of PFAS levels and profiles. Summed PFAS (Σ22PFASs) concentrations averaged 6.5 ± 2.7 ng L-1 in the dissolved phase and 3.0 ± 1.2 ng g-1 dry weight in the SPM. The Σ22PFASs was in the range of 1.7-13 ng g-1 wet weight in invertebrates. C5-C8 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) generally prevailed in the dissolved phase, while perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was dominant in the SPM and biota. Suspended sediment-water partitioning coefficients Log KD and Log KOC were correlated with the perfluoroalkyl chain length, as were the particle-bound fraction and bioaccumulation factors (Log BAF). Compound-specific Log BAFs varied within a limited range over the period surveyed. Biomagnification factors (mysids/copepods) were consistently >1 for PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, and long-chain PFCAs (perfluorodecanoate and perfluorododecanoate), suggesting biomagnification at the base of the estuarine food web."

Moreover, PSi surface modification is an important step to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation. In this work, a combination of optical and electrochemical studies is performed to elaborate a suitable PSi multilayer substrate for cell culture. For this study, we modified PSi surface by silanization and antibody grafting (APTES-anti STRO1), the 12-mer specific peptide to silicon p + type coating and the peptide modified with the antibody recognition sequence. Electrochemical characterization of PSi multilayers is performed to investigate its electrical behavior, determine the optimal measuring conditions and reveal the most stable PSi surfaces. Then, the behavior of dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) was investigated on various modified PSi surfaces. An electrochemical method was applied for the first time monitoring the electrical behavior of stem cell adhesion. The cells electrochemical behavior depends on the nature of the surface coating and the peptide-anti STRO1 improved adhesion and cell spreading onto the PSi surface compared to bare surface and the one coated with the peptide. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that all surface modification methods enhance cell adhesion compared to the bare PSi surface. An increased cell number is observed on APTES-anti STRO1, peptide and peptide-anti STRO1 coated PSi. The peptide-anti STRO1 provided the best cell proliferation results suggesting the improved accessibility of the recognition fragment of the antibody anti-STRO1.","DoE-based development, physicochemical characterization, and pharmacological evaluation of a topical hydrogel containing betamethasone dipropionate microemulsion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176120,"Colloids and surfaces.

Second, a hydrogel-containing microemulsion was developed using cellulose derivatives, and its anti-inflammatory and skin irritation effects were evaluated. Face-centered central composite design was used to investigate the impacts of two independent variables (oleic acid and ratio of surfactant to cosolvent, S/CoS) on three dependent variables (skin deposition, flux of BMD, and microemulsion droplet size). The microemulsion including oleic acid at a low level (coded with -1) and S/CoS at a high level (coded with +1) was considered optimal since it was the most effective in terms of skin deposition and flux of BMD. Different cellulose derivatives (HPMC E6, HEC, NaCMC, and CMC) were screened to prepare a hydrogel-containing microemulsion based on four properties: flux and skin deposition of BMD, hydration of stratum corneum, and rheological properties of hydrogel-containing microemulsion (ME-hydrogel). The anti-inflammatory effect and flux of BMD from optimal ME-hydrogel with carboxymethyl cellulose as the hydrogel-forming agent were then compared to those of the hydrogel-containing solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN-hydrogel) and nanostructure lipid carriers (NLC-hydrogel). The percentage of edema inhibition declined proportionally with flux of BMD in the following order: ME-hydrogel (44.56 ± 8.08%) > NLC-hydrogel (35.93 ± 7.22%) > SLN-hydrogel (25.68 ± 9.05%).",Facile immobilization of Trametes versicolor laccase on highly monodisperse superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176119,"Colloids and surfaces.

In this article, a complex DDS named DOX@MSN-ZnO-PLL-PLL(DMA) was prepared. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was loaded in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), which were then covered by ZnO in situ. Poly-L-lysine (PLL) and 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride functionalized PLL (PLL(DMA)) were finally coated on the nanoparticles through a Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly process with PLL(DMA) outside to obtain the carriers. The negative charged PLL(DMA) avoided the unspecific uptake of the carriers by normal cells at pH 7.4. While the charge-reversal property could reverse the zeta-potential of the carriers to positive in weakly acidic tumor tissues at pH 6.5, which promoted the cytophagy of the carriers by cancer cells. ZnO which blocked the pores of MSNs could be dissolved intracellular due to the more acidic environment in endosome/lysosome, and resulting in drug release for cancer cell apoptosis. Zeta-potential measurements, the in vitro cellular uptake behaviors as well as cellular cytotoxicity of the carriers at different pH values were investigated to prove the charge-reversal property. The in vitro drug release studies and the cellular cytotoxicity studies were also investigated to prove the controlled DOX release behavior of the carriers.

We observed structural dependence of Nd nanoparticles on biocompatibility, the spherical polymorphs showed better biocompatibility when compared with cuboidal and nanorod shaped polymorphs of neodymium. The Nd nanopolymorphs in spherical morphology exhibited least redox modulating effect compared to cuboidal shaped that was higher when compared to Nd nanorods. The efficacy of the Nd Nanopolymorphs to induce biological effect in particular on angiogenic process was observed to be directly related to the polymorphs ability to modulate redox signaling. The redox signaling was observed to be via PKM2-NOX4 signaling pathways. Further the results demonstrated that ROS generated by cuboid and rod shaped nanopolymorphs activated the pro-angiogenic factors namely VE-cadherin, HIF 1α, VEGF and VEGFR-2 to facilitate the angiogenic process. The manuscript highlights the importance of rare earth metal nanoparticles in modulating biological process for therapeutic interventions.

Enzyme activity, release mechanism, and perspectives for ophthalmology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176116,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 14,"Mesoporous vaterite CaCO3 crystals are nowadays one of the most popular vectors for loading of fragile biomolecules like proteins due to biocompatibility, high loading capacity, cost effective and simple loading procedures. However, recent studies reported the reduction of bioactivity for protein encapsulation into the crystals in water due to rather high alkaline pH of about 10.3 caused by the crystal hydrolysis. In this study we have investigated how to retain the bioactivity and control the release rate of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) loaded into the crystals via co-synthesis. SOD is widely used as an antioxidant in ophthalmology and its formulations with high protein content and activity as well as opportunities for a sustained release are highly desirable. Here we demonstrate that SOD co-synthesis can be done at pH 8.5 in a buffer without affecting crystal morphology. The synthesis in the buffer allows reaching the high loading efficiency of 93%, high SOD content (24 versus 15 w/w % for the synthesis in water), and order of magnitude higher activity compared to the synthesis in water. The enormous SOD concentration into crystals of 10-2 M is caused by the entrapment of SOD aggregates into the crystal pores. The SOD released from crystals at physiologically relevant ionic strength fully retains its bioactivity. As found by fitting the release profiles using zero-order and Baker-Lonsdale models, the SOD release mechanism is governed by both the SOD aggregate dissolution and by the diffusion of SOD molecules thorough the crystal pores. The latest process contributes more in case of the co-synthesis in the buffer because at higher pH (co-synthesis in water) the unfolded SOD molecules aggregate stronger. The release is bi-modal with a burst (ca 30%) followed by a sustained release and a complete release due to the recrystallization of vaterite crystals to non-porous calcite crystals. The mechanism of SOD loading into and release from the crystals as well as perspectives for the use of the crystals for SOD delivery in ophthalmology are discussed. We believe that together with a fundamental understanding of the vaterite-based protein encapsulation and protein release, this study will help to establish a power platform for a mild and effective encapsulation of fragile biomolecules like proteins at bio-friendly conditions.","Poloxamer-407 thickened lipid colloidal system of agomelatine for brain targeting: Characterization, brain pharmacokinetic study and behavioral study on Wistar rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176115,"Colloids and surfaces.

To impart mucoadhesive property, 0.5% w/v concentration of chitosan was ensured in the final formulation, named as Ago-NE-gel+0.5%chitosan. The gelling point and mucoadhesive strength of Ago-NE-gel+0.5%chitosan were found to be 28 ± 1 °C, and 6246.27 dynes/cm2 respectively. The size of free micelles of Poloxamer-407 was recorded graphically at 18.43 ± 0.95 nm whereas the size of sterically stabilized Ago-NE was observed at 142.58 ± 4.21 nm. The viscosity and pH of Ago-NE-gel+0.5%chitosan were found to be 2439 ± 23 cP (at 35 ± 1 °C temperature) and 5.8 ± 0.2 respectively.

In the present work, a DNA biosensor to detect ZIKV in real human serum samples was developed using an oxidized glassy carbon electrode (ox-GCE) modified with silsesquioxane-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-SiPy). This nanohybrid was characterized by UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, DLS, and XRD. The conditions for the immobilization of a ZIKV ssDNA probe on the electrode surface (ox-GCE-[AuNPs-SiPy]) were optimized by univariate and multivariate analysis. The optimized biosensor was characterized by CV, EIS and AFM experiments. The ZIKV target recognition was based on the variation of the charge transfer resistance (ΔRct) of the redox marker ([Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) used and the roughness (Rq) of the electrode surface. The proposed biosensor presented a LOD of 0.82 pmol L-1, with a linear range of 1.0 x10-12 - 1.0 x10-6 mol L-1.

Food security depends on adequate production and demands are predicted to rise as the global population rises. The need for increased yields will have to be coupled to the efficient use of resources including fertilisers such as nitrogen to underpin the sustainability of food production. Although optimally performing crops with high yields require a balanced mineral nutrition, nitrogen fundamentally drives growth and yield as well as requirements for other nutrients. It is estimated that globally only 33% of applied nitrogen fertiliser is recovered in the harvested grain, indicative of a huge waste of resource and potential major pollutant and is thus a major target for crop improvement. Both agronomy and breeding will contribute to improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and an important component of the latter is harnessing germplasm variation. This review will consider the key traits involved in NUE, the potential to exploit genetic variation for these specific traits, and the approaches to be utilised.","Development of potential preclinical candidates with promising in vitro ADME profile for the inhibition of type 1 and type 2 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases: Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176098,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 14,"Estrogens are the major female sex steroid hormones, estradiol (E2) being the most potent form in humans. Disturbing the balance between E2 and its weakly active oxidized form estrone (E1) leads to diverse types of estrogen-dependent diseases such as endometriosis or osteoporosis. 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1) catalyzes the biosynthesis of E2 by reduction of E1 while the type 2 enzyme catalyzes the reverse reaction. Thus, 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD2 are attractive targets for treatment of estrogen-dependent diseases. Recently, we reported the first proof-of-principle study of a 17β-HSD2 inhibitor in a bone fracture mouse model, using subcutaneous administration. In the present study, our aim was to improve the in vitro ADME profile of the most potent 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD2 inhibitors described so far. The optimized compounds show strong and selective inhibition of both the human enzymes and their murine orthologs. In addition, they display good metabolic stability in human liver microsomes (S9 fraction), low in vitro cytotoxicity as well as better aqueous solubility and physicochemical properties compared to the lead compounds. These achievements make the compounds eligible for testing in preclinical in vivo animal model studies on the effects of inhibition of 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD2.",Synthesis and biological evaluation of 5-aminoethyl benzophenanthridone derivatives as DNA topoisomerase IB inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176097,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 14,"DNA topoisomerase IB (TOP1) regulates DNA topological structure in many cellular metabolic processes and is a validated target for development of antitumor agents.

Among the synthesized compounds, compound 15e, the most potent N1-selective inhibitor targeting 150-cavity, showed 1.5 and 1.8 times greater activity than oseltamivir carboxylate (OSC) against N1 (H5N1) and N1 (H5N1-H274Y). In cellular assays, 15e also exhibited greater potency than OSC against H5N1 with EC50 of 0.66 μM. In addition, 15e demonstrated low cytotoxicity in vitro and low acute toxicity in mice.

Several strategies have been employed for the development of inhibitors against this polypeptide. The most successful strategy is targeting the N-terminal ATP binding region of the chaperone. However, till date not a single molecule reached Phase-IV of clinical trials from this class of Hsp90 inhibitors. The other approach is to target the Cterminal region of the protein. The success with this approach has been limited due to lack of well-defined ligand binding pocket in this terminal. The other promising strategy is to prevent the interaction of client proteins/co-chaperones with Hsp90 protein, i.e., protein-protein interaction inhibitors of Hsp90. The review focuses on advantage of this approach along with the recent advances in the discovery of inhibitors by following this strategy.

Recent studies have examined the diploid genome of C. albicans by performing both short-term microevolution studies and comparative genomics on collections of clinical isolates. Common mechanisms driving genome dynamics include accumulation of point mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events, large-scale chromosomal rearrangements, and even ploidy change, with important consequences for both drug resistance and host adaptation. Evidence for recombination between C. albicans lineages also highlights a role for (para)sex in shaping the species population structure.

The advanced glycation end products accumulated in the jaw bone could lead to potential failure of a dental implant during the initial integration stage, because of the inferior bone mechanical property associated with the abnormal collagen cross-linking at the material level. Here, we demonstrate the lowered creep deformation resistance and reduced dimensional recovery of jaw bone in line with high levels of pentosidine accumulation in the bone matrix which likely correlate with the pentosidine level in blood plasma. Peripheral blood samples and cortical bone samples at the surgical site were obtained from patients scheduled for dental implants in the mandible. The pentosidine levels in blood plasma were assessed. Subsequently, the relative pentosidine levels and the mechanical properties of the jaw bone were quantified by Raman microspectroscopy and nanoindentation, respectively. The nanoindentation tests revealed less creep deformation resistance and reduced time-dependent dimensional recovery of bone samples with the increase in the relative pentosidine level in the bone matrix. Higher tan δ values at the various frequencies during the dynamic indentation tests also suggested that viscoelasticity is associated with the relative intensity of pentosidine in the jaw bone matrix. We found a positive correlation between the pentosidine levels in blood plasma and the bone matrix, which in turn reduced the mechanical property of the jaw bone at the material level. Increased creep and reduced dimensional recovery of the jaw bone may diminish the mechanical interlocking of dental implants during the initial integration stage. Given the likely correlation between the plasma pentosidine level and the mechanical properties of bone, measurement of the plasma pentosidine level could serve as a new index to assess jaw bone matrix quality in advance of implant surgery.",Air-abrasion using new silica-alumina powders containing different silica concentrations: Effect on the microstructural characteristics and fatigue behavior of a Y-TZP ceramic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176090,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 14,"This study assessed the fatigue performance (biaxial flexure fatigue strength), surface characteristics (topography and roughness) and structural stability (t-m phase transformation) of a Y-TZP ceramic subjected to air-abrasion using new powders (7% and 20% silica-coated aluminum oxide particles) in comparison to commercially available powders. Disc-shaped specimens were manufactured (ISO 6872-2015) and randomly allocated into four groups considering the air-abrasion materials: SiC: commercially available silica-coated aluminum oxide; AlOx: commercially available aluminum oxide; 7%Si and 20%Si: experimentally produced materials consisting of 7% and 20% silica-coated AlOx, respectively. Air-abrasion was executed by a blinded researcher (1 cm distance from the tip to the specimen surface, under 2.8 bar pressure for 10 s). The fatigue tests (n = 15) were performed by the staircase method under a piston-on-three-balls assembly. Topography and roughness assessments (n = 30) of abraded samples and fractography of failed discs were performed. The highest fatigue strength (MPa) was observed for 7%Si (887.20 ± 50.54) and SiC (878.16 ± 29.81), while the lowest fatigue strength for 20%Si (773.89 ± 46.44) and AlOx (796.70 ± 46.48). Topography analysis depicted similar surface morphology for all conditions. However, roughness (μm) was only statistically different between 7%Si (Ra = 0.30 ± 0.09; Rz = 2.31 ± 0.63) and SiC (Ra = 0.26 ± 0.04; Rz = 1.99 ± 0.34). Monoclinic phase grains appeared on Y-TZP surface in a similar content (≈11-12%) for the protocols. Fractography showed all failures starting on air-abraded surface/sub-surface defects from the tensile side. In terms of roughness, phase transformation and fatigue, the new 7% silica-coated aluminum oxide presented similar behavior to the commercially available powder. Increasing silica-coating concentration to 20% did not lead to a gentle air-abrasion protocol."

However, this provides no quantitative information about the level of contamination. To achieve this, we propose an approach based on the inversion of the PROSPECT model. 1620 leaves from five species were collected on a site contaminated by 16 to 77 g.kg-1 of TPH over a 14-month period. Their spectral signature was measured and used in PROSPECT model inversions to retrieve leaf biochemistry. The model performed well for simulating the spectral signatures (RMSE < 2%) and for estimating leaf pigment contents (RMSE ≤ 2.95 μg.cm-2 for chlorophylls). Four out of the five species exhibited alterations in pigment contents when exposed to TPH. A strong correlation was established between leaf chlorophyll content and soil TPH concentrations (R2 ≥ 0.74) for three of them, allowing accurate predictions of TPH (RMSE =3.20 g.kg-1 and RPD = 5.17). The accuracy of predictions varied by season and improved after the growing period.

In the present work, we develop a molecular theory that allows to investigate the adsorption and insertion of ARCPPs on membranes bearing hydrophilic pores. This method accounts for size, shape, conformation, protonation state and charge distribution of the peptides; it also describes the state of protonation of acidic membrane lipids. We present a systematic investigation of the effect of pore size, peptide concentration and sequence length on the extent of peptide adsorption and insertion into the pores. We show that adsorption on the intact (non-porated) lipid membrane plays a key role on peptide translocation. For peptides shorter than nona-arginine, adsorption on the intact membrane increases significantly with chain length, but it saturates for longer peptides. However, this adsorption behavior only occurs at relatively low peptide concentrations; increasing peptide concentration favors adsorption of the shorter molecules. Adsorption of longer peptides increases the intact membrane negative charge as a result of further deprotonation of acidic lipids. Peptide insertion into the pores depends non-monotonically on pore radius, which reflects the short range nature of the effective membrane-peptide interactions. The size of the pore that promotes maximum adsorption depends on the peptide chain length. Peptide translocation is a thermally activated process, so we complement our thermodynamic approach with a simple kinetic model that allows to rationalize the ARCPPs translocation rate in terms of the free energy gain of adsorption, and the energy cost of creating a transmembrane pore with peptides in it. Our results indicate that strategies to improve translocation efficiency should focus on enhancing peptide adsorption.",Magnetic liposome design for drug release systems responsive to super-low frequency alternating current magnetic field (AC MF).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176052,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 06 16,"Magnetic liposomes are shown to release the entrapped dye once modulated by low frequency AC MF.

However, 2D/2D heterojunction materials, especially those that connect different materials together using strong chemical bonds, are still challenging to prepare. Herein, a novel hydrogen bond-assisted 2D/2D Z-scheme SnNb2O6/Bi2WO6 system was successfully prepared using a facile hydrothermal method. The 2D/2D Z-scheme system increases the accessible area for charges and constructs interfacial electric fields, thereby reducing the barriers for electron transport and enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the electronic coupling of the surface hydrogen bonds can further enhance the interfacial electric fields, which offers a new route for lowering the interfacial potential barrier of the system. As expected, the hydrogen bond-assisted 2D/2D Z-scheme SnNb2O6/Bi2WO6 system results in an outstanding improvement of the norfloxacin (NOR) photodegradation efficiency, and the degradation rate constant (4.06 × 10-2 min-1) is 9 and 2 times higher than those of SnNb2O6 (4.33 × 10-3 min-1), and Bi2WO6 (1.70 × 10-2 min-1), respectively.

Finally, a fast charge transfer mechanism of the hydrogen bonds that are connected to the 2D/2D Z-scheme SnNb2O6/Bi2WO6 system is proposed, which is based on the ESR analysis and the DFT calculations.",In situ growth of ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets on reduced oxide graphene as an enhanced oxygen evolution electrocatalyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176050,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 06 12,"It is highly essential but challengeable to explore the earth-abundant and low-cost oxygen evolution reaction catalysts to replace Ir- or/and Ru-based ones.

Progesterone (PG), neuroactive steroids, exerts a characteristic neuroprotective function in improving AD syndrome. The NOD-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3)-Caspase-1 inflammasome has specific relevance to AD pathological procession. However, the exact role of PG in regulating NLRP3-Caspase-1 inflammasome remains to be elucidated. We demonstrated Aβ up-regulated IL-1β expression in astrocytes by activating NLRP3-Caspase-1 inflammasome. However, pharmacological activation of autophagy by Rapamycin (RAPA) efficiently suppressed Aβ-, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced IL-1β expression via regulating NLRP3-Caspase-1 inflammasome in astrocytes. Remarkably, PG significantly inhibited Aβ-induced NLRP3-Caspase-1 inflammasome activation. Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA blocked the protective effects of PG in mediating NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β processing. Taken together, our observations suggest that autophagy-lysosome pathway is one specific molecular mechanism in regulating Aβ-induced NLRP3-Caspase-1 inflammasome activation in astrocytes, particularly uncover the potential neuroprotection of PG in regulating upstream signaling leading to the sequence events of neuroinflammation. That neuroprotective mechanism of PG in regulating NLRP3-Caspase-1 inflammasome can be a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating the pathological procession of AD."

Herein, we mainly focused on the alterations and roles of putative novel miRNAs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. The results identified 247 putative novel, differentially expressed miRNAs, of which only 11 miRNAs presented an opposite trend between the EV71- and CA16-infected samples and were used for target prediction. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the predicted targets displayed the top 15 significant biological processes, molecular functions, cell components and pathways. Subsequently, regulatory miRNA-predicted targets and miRNA-GO and miRNA-pathway networks were constructed to further reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of the miRNAs during infection. Therefore, our data provide useful insights that will help elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infections and may offer novel therapeutic targets for these infections.",Status of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii harboring carbapenemase: First systematic review and meta-analysis from Iran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176030,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 06 16,"Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has been considered as an important pathogen causing hospital-acquired infections thought the world.

In the present study, a quantitative proteomic analysis was conducted to profile acetylome in porcine muscle within 24 h PM. In total 595 acetylation sites assigned to 163 proteins were identified in porcine muscle, of which 460 sites distributing to 110 proteins significantly changed in acetylation levels in the conversion of muscle to meat. The dynamic acetylation/deacetylaion of muscle proteins was closely associated with critical chemical-biophysical changes in PM muscle. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that protein lysine acetylation likely regulated postmortem meat quality development by regulating glycolysis and muscle pH, cell stress reponse and apoptosis, muscle contraction and rigor mortis, calcium signaling and proteolysis, IMP synthesis and meat flavor development, and even the stability of pigment proteins and meat color. This study provided the first overview of protein lysine acetylation in PM muscle and revealed its significance in the conversion of muscle to meat. Future exploration of the exact role of protein lysine acetylation at specific sites will further our understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms and be helpful for meat quality control.","A three-pronged ""Pitchfork"" strategy enables an extensive description of the human membrane proteome and the identification of missing proteins.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176011,Journal of proteomics,2019 06 15,"Integral membrane proteins are under-represented in standard proteomic analyses, mostly because of their low expression and absence of trypsin-cleavage sites in their hydrophobic transmembrane segments. Novel and effective strategies for membrane proteomic analysis aim at soluble N-glycosylated segments of integral membrane proteins (CSC, SPEG, N-glyco-FASP) or selectively target the hydrophobic transmembrane alpha-helical segments employing chemical peptide cleavage by CNBr (hpTC). We combined a solid phase enrichment of glycopeptides (SPEG) with a transmembrane segment-oriented hpTC method and a standard ""detergent and trypsin"" approach into a three-pronged ""Pitchfork"" strategy to maximize the membrane proteome coverage in human lymphoma cells. This strategy enabled the identification of >1200 integral membrane proteins from all cellular compartments, including 105 CD antigens, 24 G protein-coupled receptors, and 141 solute carrier transporters. The advantage of the combination lies in the complementarity of the methods. SPEG and hpTC target different sets of membrane proteins. HpTC provided identifications of proteins and peptides with significantly higher hydrophobicity compared to SPEG and detergent-trypsin approaches. Among all identified proteins, we observed 32 so-called ""missing proteins"". The Pitchfork strategy presented here is universally applicable and enables deep and fast description of membrane proteomes in only 3 LC-MS/MS runs per replicate. SIGNIFICANCE: Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are encoded by roughly a quarter of human coding genes. Their functions and their specific localization makes IMPs highly attractive drug targets. In fact, roughly half of the currently approved drugs in medicine target IMPs. Our knowledge of membrane proteomes is, however, limited. We present a new strategy for the membrane proteome analysis that combines three complementary methods targeting different features of IMPs. Using the combined strategy, we identified over 1200 IMPs in human lymphoma tissue from all sub-cellular compartments in only 3 LC-MS/MS runs per replicate. The three-pronged ""Pitchfork"" strategy is universally applicable, and offers a fast way toward a reasonably concise description of membrane proteomes in multiple samples.",The role of serpin protein on the natural immune defense against pathogen infection in Lampetra japonica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176010,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 06 16,"Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are a large protein family that is involved in various physiological processes and is known to regulate innate immunity pathways. However, research for the functional study of serpins in lamprey is limited. In the present study, a serpin gene was cloned and characterized from Lampetra japonica at molecular, protein and cellular levels, named L-serpin which belongs to family F serine protease inhibitors (serpin family). The L-serpin includes a serpin domain in the N-terminus. The mRNA transcript of L-serpin was extensively expressed in kidney, supraneural body, intestine, liver, heart, gill and the highest expression in leukocytes. The mRNA expression level of L-serpin increased significantly after Vibrio anguillarum, Staphylocccus aureus and Poly I:C stimulation and dramatically peak at 8 h. It is demonstrated that the L-serpin protected cells from lethal Gram-negative endotoxemia through associating with inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered cell death and inflammatory factors expression. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and the microbe binding assay were used to determine that L-serpin interacts directly with LPS (KD = 6.14 × 10-7 M). Furthermore, we confirmed L-serpin is a major inhibitor of complement activation by inactivating lamprey-C1q protein (KD = 2.06 × 10-6 M). Taken together, these findings suggest that L-serpin is a endogenous anti-inflammatory factor to defend against Gram-negative bacterial challenge and involved in lamprey innate immunity.","Citric acid mitigates soybean meal induced inflammatory response and tight junction disruption by altering TLR signal transduction in the intestine of turbot, Scophthalmus maximus L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176009,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 06 16,"A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of citric acid on the involvement of TLRs in the soybean meal induced inflammatory response and tight junction disruption in the distal intestine of juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.). Four isonitrogenous and isolipidic practical diets were formulated: fish meal-based diet (FM); 40% fish meal protein in FM replaced with soybean meal protein (SBM); SBM + 1.5% citric acid and SBM + 3% citric acid. Compared to the FM, diet SBM significantly increased the gene expression of TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5b, TLR9, TLR21, TLR22) and MyD88, as well as TLR related molecules (NF-κB, IRF-3, p38 and JNK), which were remarkably reduced by dietary citric acid. Similarly, citric acid supplementation in SBM markedly depressed gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) and pore-forming tight junction protein Claudin-7, and enhanced gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β1 and TJ proteins related to the decrease in paracellular permeability (Claudin-3, Claudin-4, Occludin, Tricellulin and ZO-1). Compared to the SBM, the concentration of IgM and C4 in serum was significantly reduced by dietary citric acid. In brief, dietary citric acid could synchronously inhibit TLRs-dependent inflammatory response regulated by NF-κB and IRF3, as well as cause TLRs-dependent tight junction disruption modulated by p38 and JNK. Therefore, citric acid could function on mitigating soybean meal induced enteropathy in the distal intestine of juvenile turbot.",Inhibition of Cyclophilin A on the replication of red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus associates with multiple pro-inflammatory factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176008,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 06 16,"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitously expressed cellular protein and involves in diverse pathological conditions, including infection and inflammation. CypA acts as a key factor in the replication of several viruses. However, little is known about the role of CypA in the replication of the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV). In the present report, grouper CypA (GF-CypA) was cloned from the grouper fin cell line (GF-1) derived from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Sequence analysis found that GF-CypA open reading frame (ORF) of 495 bp encodes a polypeptide of 164 amino acids residues with a molecular weight of 17.4 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highly conserved regions with CypA of other animal species, showing that GF-CypA is a new member of Cyclophilin A family. We observed that GF-CypA was up-regulated in the GF-1 cells infected with RGNNV. Additionally, overexpression of CypA could significantly inhibit the replication of RGNNV in GF-1 cells. By contrast, when the GF-CypA was knock-downed by siRNA in GF-1 cells, the replication of RGNNV was enhanced. Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-2, TNF-α, IL-1b, and ISG-15, were increased in GF-CypA transfected GF-1 cells challenged with RGNNV, indicating that GF-CypA might be involved in the regulation of the host pro-inflammatory factors. Altogether, we conclude that GF-CypA plays a vital role in the inhibitory effect of RGNNV replication that might be modulating the cytokines secretion in GF-1 cells during RGNNV infection. These results will shed new light on the function of CypA in the replication of RGNNV and will pave a new way for the prevention of the infection of RGNNV in fish.",Identification and functional analysis of the Mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) hypoxia-inducible factor-1α involved in the immune response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176007,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 06 16,"Mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) is a popular cultured freshwater fish species due to its high market value in China. With increasing density of breeding, mandarin fish is often cultured under low environmental oxygen concentrations (hypoxia). In this study, the relative expression levels of hypoxia response element (HRE)-luciferase reporter and the HIF signaling pathway downstream genes (scldha, scvegf, and scglut-1) were significantly increased by hypoxic stress, thereby indicating that mandarin fish has an HIF signaling pathway. The mandarin fish HIF-1α (scHIF-1α) was also characterized. Multiple sequence alignments showed that scHIF-1α presented similar architectures to other known vertebrates. Subcellular localization analysis showed that scHIF-1α was mainly located in the nucleus of the mandarin fish fry-1 (MFF-1) cells. The role of scHIF-1α in the regulation of the HIF signaling pathway was confirmed. Overexpression of scHIF-1α could induce the HIF signaling pathway, whereas knockdown of scHIF-1α inhibited the activity of the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Tissue distribution analysis showed that schif-1α was significantly highly expressed in the blood, heart, and liver, which indicated that the main function of scHIF-1α was closely related to the circulatory system. Furthermore, scHIF-1α expression was significantly induced by poly I:C, poly dG:dC or PMA, thereby indicating that scHIF-1α was involved in the immune response. HIF-1α plays an important role in pathogen infections in mammals, but its role in fish is rarely investigated. Overexpression of scHIF-1α could inhibit MRV and SCRV infections, whereas knockdown of scHIF-1α could promote such infections. Those results suggested that scHIF-1α played an important role in fish virus infection.

In our study, a complete set of 23 apo genes was identified and annotated from spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus). Phylogenetic and homology analyses provided evidence for their annotation and evolutionary relationships. To investigate their potential roles in the immune response, the expression patterns of 23 apo genes were determined in the liver and intestine by qRT-PCR after Vibrio harveyi infection. After infection, a total of 20 differentially expressed apo genes were observed, and their expression profiles varied among the genes and tissues. 5 apo genes (apoA1, apoA4a.1, apoC2, apoF and apoO) were dramatically induced or suppressed (log2 fold change >4, P < 0.05), suggesting their involvement in the immune response of spotted sea bass. Our study provides a valuable foundation for future studies aimed at uncovering the specific roles of each apo gene during bacterial infection in spotted sea bass and other teleost species.",The visual system of Thelyphonida (whip scorpions): Support for Arachnopulmonata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176004,Arthropod structure & development,2019 06 08,"Only a few studies have examined the central visual system of Thelyphonida (whip scorpions) until now. To obtain new insights suitable for phylogenetic analysis we studied the axonal trajectories and neuropil architecture of the central visual systems of two whip scorpion species (Mastigoproctus giganteus and Typopeltis dalyi) with different neuroanatomical techniques (Cobalt fills, Wigglesworth stains, and μCT). The central visual system of whip scorpion comprises one pair of median eyes and one pair of lateral eye triplets. The R-cells (or retinula cells) of both eye types each terminate in a first and a second visual neuropil. Furthermore, a few R-cell fibres from the median eyes leave the second median eye visual neuropil and terminate in the second and the first lateral eye neuropil. This means R-cell terminals from the lateral eyes and the median eyes overlap here. Additionally, the arcuate body and mushroom bodies are described. A detailed comparison of our findings with previously studied chelicerate central visual systems seems to support a monophyly of Arachnopulmonata, i.e. a clade comprising Tetrapulmonata (Thelyphonida, Schizomida, Amblypygi, and Araneae) and Scorpions. Furthermore, the architecture of the central visual systems hints at a close evolutionary relationship of Arachnopulmonata and Xiphosura."

Nowadays, they are only marketed as solid dosage forms such as capsules or tablets. Therefore, the development of a liquid oral dosage form with modified-release properties has been keenly awaited to increase the compliance of patients with a swallowing impairment, such as paediatric, older or critically ill patients. In this study, a new technology has been developed that consists of multi-layered particles suspended extemporaneously in a syrup, using omeprazole as a model drug. The coating procedure was optimized to obtain a yield of minimum 90% w/w and a mean diameter below 500 µm. Eudragit® E100 and Eudragit® L100-55 were used to prevent the early release of omeprazole in the syrup and in the acidic environment of the stomach, respectively. These polymers allowed the stability of the coated particles to be ensured when dispersed in a liquid and the enteric release of the drug to be targeted. It was demonstrated that our new system presented similar release performances to existing marketed enteric dosage forms. It is able to protect omeprazole for 2 hours in acidic medium at pH 1.2, while omeprazole was entirely released at pH 6.8 within 45 min. Once the final suspension is prepared extemporaneously, it presents sufficient stability to guarantee the administration of multiple doses filled into a syrup bottle and kept for a limited storage time at room temperature (e.g. up to 10 doses to be administered within 10 days).",Monitoring of the freezing stage in a freeze-drying process using IR thermography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175990,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 16,"This paper presents a new Process Analytical Technology based on the use of an infrared camera and a mathematical model to estimate the ice crystal size distribution obtained at the end of the freezing stage of a vial freeze-drying process. Both empirical laws and first-principle based equations, already presented in the Literature, may be used to this purpose, if the temperature gradient in the frozen product and the freezing front rate are obtained from the analysis of the thermal images. The resistance of the dried product to vapor flux may be then calculated from the distribution of the ice crystal diameters, thus enabling the use of a one-dimensional model for process simulation and optimization. Freeze-drying of 5% and 10% w/w aqueous sucrose solutions, and of 5% w/w aqueous mannitol solutions, were considered as case study. The results were validated comparing the calculated diameters of the pores of the dried cake, corresponding to the ice crystal diameters, with the results experimentally obtained from the analysis of the SEM images, and comparing the values of drying duration and maximum product temperature calculated with the mathematical model with those measured experimentally. Results evidences the effectiveness of the proposed system for process monitoring.",Synergetic effect of nucleation and crystal growth inhibitor on in vitro-in vivo performance of supersaturable lacidipine solid dispersion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175988,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 08,"Limited supersaturation maintaining duration is the main challenge for amorphous solid dispersion design. Nucleation or crystal growth inhibitors may function in different ways but the combination use of nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors in supersaturated system is rarely explored. Thus, using Lacidipine (LCDP) as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) II model drug, the aim of this study was to explore whether the combination use of nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors could provide a synergistic effect on the in vitro-in vivo performance of poorly water-soluble drugs. First of all, based on compatibility screening using solubility parameter (Δδ) and crystallization inhibition efficiency as criteria, soluplus (SOL) and gum arabic (GA) were selected as the most effective nucleation and crystal growth inhibitor respectively. Thereafter, the supersaturated drug solutions were spray dried and characterized. The in vitro release, physical stability as well as pharmacokinetic behavior were investigated. It was found that the combination use of SOL and GA did not present remarkable advantage in prolonging the supersaturation time in solution state. However, their synergistic effect in equilibrium solubility and dissolution enhancement was noticed at SOL/GA ratio 3:1, with 5-7 times higher dissolution rate observed for LCDP/SOL/GA based formulation compared with that of LCDP/SOL, which was maintained even after three months accelerated stability test under non-sink condition. Moreover, compared to the LCDP/SOL formulation, approximately 2.8 and 2.5-fold increase in the maximum plasma concentration (C max) and the area under the plasma-time curve (AUC0-∞) was achieved with LCDP/SOL/GA based formulation. Possible mechanism of the synergistic effect was elucidated, indicating GA may penetrate into SOL particles providing both electrostatic and steric stabilization. In conclusion, the combination use of screened nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors might be an efficient approach to design supersaturated drug delivery system.",Effect of surfactant on the size and stability of PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating a protein kinase C inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175987,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 08,"Nowadays many drugs with improved therapeutic efficacy are discovered but cannot be utilized due to their low solubility and insufficient bioavailability. An example of such a drug molecule is a protein kinase C inhibitor that influences an enzyme which plays an important role in several signal transduction cascades. The aim of this study was to formulate a stable nanoparticle dispersion of the PKC inhibitor encapsulated into PLGA nanoparticles (NPs). Encapsulation of the PKC inhibitor into PLGA NPs of 100 to 200 nm diameter should provide a targeted delivery to the inflammation sites. The NPs were prepared via nanoprecipitation and different surfactants were investigated: Fully and partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mowiol X-88 and X-98), poloxamers (Pluronic F68 and F127) and polysorbates (Tween 20 and 80). From all surfactants tested, only NPs prepared with partially hydrolyzed PVA (Mowiol X-88) provided the desired stability throughout the downstream processes. These NPs were subsequently analyzed regarding their particle size, polydispersity, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity. Dynamic light scattering results revealed that monodisperse NPs of 150 to 220 nm were formed, a size range that favors targeted delivery. The drug encapsulation efficiency varied from 31 to 75% with a drug loading of 1.3 to 2%. Moreover, the long-term stability was studied and the residual amount of PVA of the NP solutions was quantified via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The shell-less hen's egg model was used to test toxic effects (hemorrhage, vascular lysis, thrombosis, hemolysis and lethality) of the NPs in a more complex biological system under dynamic flow conditions.",3D printed polyamide macroencapsulation devices combined with alginate hydrogels for insulin-producing cell-based therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175986,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 08,"Cell macroencapsulation has shown a great potential overcoming the low survival of the transplanted pancreatic islets in the Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) treatment, as it avoids the need for lifelong immunosuppression. It is still not completely known how these devices interact with the host immune system when implanted. However, their surface properties seem to be crucial factors for a successful implant. In this context, the hydrophilicity and porosity of the surface of the macrocapsules are two of the most important properties that can affect the functionality of the graft; hydrophilicity defines the interactions with the host's immune cells, while the porosity determines the biosafety of the device while conditioning the oxygen, nutrients and insulin diffusion. Here, we report a novel β-cell macroencapsulation system that combines an injectable alginate hydrogel with an external 3D-printed implantable device. This external macrocapsule protects the inner hydrogel containing cells, while allowing the precise location of the implant in the body. In addition, it would allow the easy extraction of the grafted cells in the case the implant fails or the renewal of the therapeutic cells is required. This study evaluates the biological effect of the macroencapsulation deviceś surface properties (hydrophilicity and porosity). We studied two different pore sizes and hydrophilicities in four different devices containing rat INS1E β-cells embedded in alginate hydrogels. All the devices showed great biocompatibility, although the hydrophilic ones exhibited higher fibroblast adhesion, which could potentially enhance the fibrotic response when implanted. Importantly, INS1E cells did not escape from the devices, denoting high biosafety. Cells grown within all devices and maintained their insulin secretory function. However, the hydrophobic device with a smaller pore size showed better cell viability values and, therefore, it might be the best candidate for the development of a safe β-cell replacement therapy in T1DM.",A Christianson syndrome-linked deletion mutation (Δ287ES288) in SLC9A6 impairs hippocampal neuronal plasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175985,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 08,"Christianson Syndrome is a rare but increasingly diagnosed X-linked intellectual disability disorder that arises from mutations in SLC9A6/NHE6, a pH-regulating transporter that localizes to early and recycling endosomes. We have recently reported that one of the originally identified disease-causing mutations in NHE6 (p.E287-S288del, or ΔES) resulted in a loss of its pH regulatory function. However, the impact of this mutation upon neuronal synapse formation and plasticity is unknown. Here, we investigate the consequences of the ΔES mutant upon mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons by expressing a fluorescently-labeled ΔES NHE6 construct into primary hippocampal neurons. Neurons expressing the ΔES mutant showed significant reductions in mature dendritic spine density with a concurrent increase in immature filopodia. Furthermore, compared to wild-type (WT), ΔES-containing endosomes are redirected away from early and recycling endosomes toward lysosomes. In parallel, the ΔES mutant reduced the trafficking of glutamatergic AMPA receptors to excitatory synapses and increased their accumulation within lysosomes for potential degradation. Upon long-term potentiation (LTP), neurons expressing ΔES failed to undergo significant structural and functional changes as observed in controls and WT transfectants. Interestingly, synapse density and LTP-induced synaptic remodeling in ΔES-expressing neurons were partially restored by bafilomycin, a vesicular alkalinisation agent, or by leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteolytic degradation. Overall, our results demonstrate that the ∆ES mutation attenuates synapse density and structural and functional plasticity in hippocampal neurons. These deficits may be partially due to the mistargeting of AMPA receptors and other cargos to lysosomes, thereby preventing their trafficking during synaptic remodeling. This mechanism may contribute to the cognitive learning deficits observed in patients with Christianson Syndrome and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment.",Mild hypothermia ameliorates anesthesia toxicity in the neonatal macaque brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175984,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 08,"Sedatives and anesthetics can injure the developing brain. They cause apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes, impair synaptic plasticity, inhibit neurogenesis and trigger long-term neurocognitive deficits. The projected vulnerable period in humans extends from the third trimester of pregnancy to the third year of life. Despite all concerns, there is no ethically and medically acceptable alternative to the use of sedatives and anesthetics for surgeries and painful interventions. Development of measures that prevent injury while allowing the medications to exert their desired actions has enormous translational value. Here we investigated protective potential of hypothermia against histological toxicity of the anesthetic sevoflurane in the developing nonhuman primate brain. Neonatal rhesus monkeys underwent sevoflurane anesthesia over 5 h. Body temperature was regulated in the normothermic (>36.5 °C), mild hypothermic (35-36.5 °C) and moderately hypothermic (<35 °C) range. Animals were euthanized at 8 h and brains examined immunohistochemically (activated caspase 3) and stereologically to quantify apoptotic neuronal and oligodendroglial death. Sevoflurane anesthesia was well tolerated at all temperatures, with oxygen saturations, end tidal CO2 and blood gases remaining at optimal levels. Compared to controls, sevoflurane exposed brains displayed significant apoptosis in gray and white matter affecting neurons and oligodendrocytes. Mild hypothermia (35-36.5 °C) conferred significant protection from apoptotic brain injury, whereas moderate hypothermia (<35 °C) did not. Hypothermia ameliorates anesthesia-induced apoptosis in the neonatal primate brain within a narrow temperature window (35-36.5 °C). Protection is lost at temperatures below 35 °C. Given the mild degree of cooling needed to achieve significant brain protection, application of our findings to humans should be explored further.","Human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) is expressed in neurons in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease and in the hMPO-α-synuclein-A53T mouse model, correlating with increased nitration and aggregation of α-synuclein and exacerbation of motor impairment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175983,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 06 08,"α-Synuclein (αSyn) is central to the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) due to its propensity for misfolding and aggregation into neurotoxic oligomers. Nitration/oxidation of αSyn leads to dityrosine crosslinking and aggregation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an oxidant-generating enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present work we have examined the impact of MPO in PD through analysis of postmortem PD brain and in a novel animal model in which we crossed a transgenic mouse expressing the human MPO (hMPO) gene to a mouse expressing human αSyn -A53T mutant (A53T) (hMPO-A53T). Surprisingly, our results show that in PD substantia nigra, the hMPO gene is expressed in neurons containing aggregates of nitrated αSyn as well as MPO-specific HOCl-modified epitopes. In our hMPO-A53T mouse model, we also saw hMPO expression in neurons but not mouse MPO. In the mouse model, hMPO was expressed in neurons colocalizing with nitrated αSyn, carbamylated lysine, nitrotyrosine, as well as HOCl-modified epitopes/proteins. RNAscope in situ hybridization confirmed hMPO mRNA expression in neurons. Interestingly, the hMPO protein expressed in hMPO-A53T brain is primarily the precursor proMPO, which enters the secretory pathway potentially resulting in interneuronal transmission of MPO and oxidative species. Importantly, the hMPO-A53T mouse model, when compared to the A53T model, exhibited significant exacerbation of motor impairment on rotating rods, balance beams, and wire hang tests. Further, hMPO expression in the A53T model resulted in earlier onset of end stage paralysis. Interestingly, there was a high concentration of αSyn aggregates in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of hippocampal CA2 region, which has been associated in humans with accumulation of αSyn pathology and neural atrophy in dementia with Lewy bodies. This accumulation of αSyn aggregates in CA2 was associated with markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response with expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), MPO, and cleaved caspase-3. Together these findings suggest that MPO plays an important role in nitrative and oxidative damage that contributes to αSyn pathology in synucleinopathies.",NEIL1 stimulates neurogenesis and suppresses neuroinflammation after stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175982,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 06 15,"Cellular exposure to ionizing radiation leads to oxidatively generated DNA damage, which has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. DNA damage is repaired by the evolutionarily conserved base excision repair (BER) system. Exposure of mice to ionizing radiation affects neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. However, the consequences of deficient DNA repair on adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation are poorly understood despite their potential relevance for homeostasis. We previously reported that loss of NEIL1, an important DNA glycosylase involved in BER, is associated with deficiencies in spatial memory, olfaction, and protection against ischemic stroke in mice. Here, we show that Neil1-/- mice display an anxiety-mediated behavior in the open field test, a deficient recognitive memory in novel object recognition and increased neuroinflammatory response under basal conditions. Further, mice lacking NEIL1 have decreased neurogenesis and deficient resolution of neuroinflammation following gamma irradiation (IR)-induced stress compared to WT mice. Neil1-/- IR-exposed mice also exhibit increased DNA damage and apoptosis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, behavioral tests two weeks after IR showed impaired stress response in the Neil1-/- mice. Our data indicate that NEIL1 plays an important role in adult neurogenesis and in the resolution of neuroinflammation.",Characterization of the complete mitochondrial genome of Uca lacteus and comparison with other Brachyuran crabs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175980,Genomics,2019 06 12,"Brachyuran crabs comprise the most species-rich clade among the crustacean order Decapoda and are divided into several major superfamilies. However, the monophyly of the superfamilies Ocypodoidea and Grapsoidea in their current compositions within the Brachyura remains inconclusive. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Uca lacteus (Ocypodoidea, Ocypodidae) was sequenced, annotated, and compared with those of other Brachyuran crabs. The circular mitogenome of U. lacteus is 15,661 base pairs long and contains the entire set of 37 genes and an A + T-rich region typically observed in decapod mitogenomes. Secondary structures of several tRNAs are partly missing (trnS1), and the number of bases is significantly decreased (trnD and trnF), as discovered in many other metazoans. We compared the gene order of U. lacteus with other species of Ocypodidae and found that they are consistent. The gene rearrangement of Ocypodidae is also identical to that of the ancestor of Brachyura. However, the order of the trnH gene varies from the rearrangement of ancestral Decapoda. Accordingly, we hypothesized that this rearrangement of trnH underwent a translocation during the evolution from Decapoda to Brachyura. The phylogenetic relationship of the 81 Brachyura species and one outgroup was recovered based on 13 protein-coding genes. This analysis confirmed that U. lacteus belongs to the family Ocypodidae and established a paraphyletic relationship between Ocypodoidea and Grapsoidea."

The small size of PMN regions, combined with their proximity to the neighboring default mode network, makes a targeted assessment of their responses in highly sampled subjects important for understanding information processing within the network. Here, we describe an experiment in which participants made semantic decisions about repeatedly-presented stimuli, assessing PMN BOLD responses as items transitioned from experimentally novel to repeated. Data are from the highly-sampled subjects in the Midnight Scan Club dataset, enabling a characterization of BOLD responses at both the group and single-subject level. Across all analyses, PMN regions deactivated in response to novel stimuli and displayed changes in BOLD activity across presentations, but did not significantly activate to repeated items. Results support only a portion of initially hypothesized effects, in particular suggesting that novelty-related deactivations may be less susceptible to attentional/task manipulations than are repetition-related activations within the network. This in turn suggests that novelty and familiarity may be processed as separable entities within the PMN.",Anabolic effects of vitamin D and magnesium in aging bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175968,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 06 08,"Decreased bone mass and an increased risk of bone fractures become more common with age. This condition is often associated with osteoporosis and is caused by an imbalance of bone resorption and new bone formation. Lifestyle factors that affect the risk of osteoporosis include alcohol, diet, hormones, physical activity, and smoking. Calcium and vitamin D are particularly important for the age-related loss of bone density and skeletal muscle mass, but other minerals, such as magnesium, also have an important role. Here, we summarize how optimal magnesium and vitamin D balance improve health outcomes in the elderly, the role of magnesium and vitamin D on bone formation, and the implications of widespread deficiency of these factors in the United States and worldwide, particularly in the elderly population.",The deficiency and the supplementation of vitamin D and liver: Lessons of chronic fructose-rich diet in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175967,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 06 16,"The fructose added to soft drinks and processed food, as well as frequent detection of vitamin D deficiency in the body, are two insults increasingly considered to cause lesions in target organs. We studied the liver after a chronic high-fructose diet deficient and supplemented with vitamin D. Sixty C57BL/6 mature male mice were allocated into six groups (n = 10) for ten weeks: control (C), control deficient in vitamin D (CDD), control supplemented with vitamin D (CDS), fructose (F), fructose deficient in vitamin D (FDD), and fructose supplemented with vitamin D (FDS). The gene expressions of vitamin D receptor and CYP27B1 and 25 hydroxyvitamin D plasma level ensured that the diets caused vitamin D deficiency or supplementation. Body mass did not change, but blood pressure (BP) increased in CDD, F, and FDD, whereas BP was controlled in FDS. Insulinemia, insulin tolerance and resistance were seen in both vitamin D deficiency and fructose groups but improved with vitamin D supplementation. The steatosis and fibrosis were observed in the CDD, F and FDD groups. Also, F and FDD showed activation of stellate cells (HSC). Lipogenesis and inflammation gene expressions were enhanced in the CDD, F and FDD groups, but diminished with vitamin D supplementation. In conclusion, we demonstrated the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on metabolism, liver steatosis and, combined with fructose intake, liver interstitial fibrosis with hepatic stellate cell activation, and alteration of the lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, and liver inflammation.

There are accumulating evidence for the interaction of IGF-1 and 17β-estradiol systems. IGF-1/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling has been reported to regulate G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) expression in cancer cells. Whether GPER is involved in the neuroprotective effect of IGF-1 against MPTP/MPP+-induced dopaminergic neuronal injury remains unclear. We showed that IGF-1 could improve MPTP-induced motor deficits and ameliorate the decreased contents of DA and its metabolites in striatum as well as the loss of TH-IR neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). IGF-1 pretreatment also reversed the changes of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expressions in SN in MPTP mice. These effects were abolished by IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) antagonist JB-1 or GPER antagonist G15 except the inhibitory effect of G15 on Bax protein expression. Moreover, IGF-1 pretreatment enhanced cell survival against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. IGF-1 exerted anti-apoptotic effects by restoring MPP+-induced changes of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expressions as well as mitochondria membrane potential. Co-treatment with JB-1 or G15 could block these effects. Furthermore, IGF-1 regulated the protein expression of GPER through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Overall, we show for the first time that GPER may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of IGF-1 against MPTP/MPP+-induced dopaminergic neuronal injury.",The association of early post-resuscitation hypotension with discharge survival following targeted temperature management for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175965,Resuscitation,2019 06 11,Approximately 40% of children who have an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in the US survive to discharge.

Here, we hypothesized that combined silica and virus exposures synergize and induce autoimmune manifestations more effectively than single exposures to either of these factors, particularly in individuals with low genetic predisposition. Accordingly, infection with the model murine pathogen lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus (LCMV) in early life, followed by airway exposure to crystalline silica in adult life, induced lupus-like autoantibodies to several nuclear self-antigens including chromatin, RNP and Sm, concurrent with kidney lesions, in non-autoimmune C57BL/6 (B6) mice.

Furthermore, in order to shed light on the mechanisms associated with molecular impairments, in silico studies were performed. The outcomes show increased expression of genes related to the dopamine-synthesis pathway (Nurr1, Th, Snca), epigenetics (TET proteins and Mecp2) and exposure to toxicants (Pon1 and Pon2) in adolescent rats compared with control group. Furthermore, increased global 5mC and 5hmC levels were observed in the DNA extracted from striatum of early-life treated rats in comparison with controls. FAIRE-qPCR analysis shows that permethrin induces an enrichment of chromatin-free DNA at the level of Th and Nurr1 promoters, and ChIP-qPCR reveals a significant reduction in methylation levels at H3K9me3 position at both Th and Nurr1 promoter regions. In silico studies show that permethrin competes for the same two binding sites of known NURR1 agonists, with a lower binding free energy for permethrin, suggesting an important durable association of permethrin with the orphan receptor. Moreover, alpha-synuclein shows a strong affinity for NURR1, corroborating previous experimental outcomes on the interactions between them. This study focuses on an emerging role of early-life exposure to environmental pollutants in the regulation of late onset diseases through intriguing mechanisms that change crucial epigenetic patterns starting from adolescent age."

In the constant search for new therapeutic alternatives, β-carboline alkaloids have been identified as good candidates for new antidepressant drugs. In this systematic review, we summarized all pre-clinical investigations involving the use of natural or semisynthetic β-carboline in depression models. A literature search was conducted in August 2018, using PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct databases. All reports were carefully analyzed, and data extraction was conducted through standardized forms. Methodological quality assessment of in vivo studies was also performed. The entire systematic review was performed according to PRISMA statement. From a total of 373 articles, 26 met all inclusion criteria. In vitro and in vivo studies have evaluated a wide variety of β-carbolines through enzymatic and binding assays, and acute or chronic animal models. Most of the in vivo and in vitro studies is concentrated on two molecules: harman and harmine. They have been investigated in several animal models and some mechanisms of action have been proposed for their antidepressant activity. In general, β-carbolines modulate 5-HT and GABA systems, promote neurogenesis, induce neuroendocrine response and restore astrocytic function, being effective when administrated acutely or chronically in different animal models, including chronic mild stress protocols. In short, β-carbolines are multi-target antidepressant compounds and may be useful in the treatment of depressive disorders.",Acidic and hepatic derivatives of bioactive clerodane diterpenes casearins J and O.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175947,Fitoterapia,2019 06 08,"Clerodane diterpenes from Casearia sylvestris are antiulcerogenic and anti-inflammatory. The finding that they may undergo acid degradation or hepatic metabolization led to an investigation of their degradation products. Purified clerodane diterpenes, casearin J and O, were subjected to in vitro assays to simulate when administered orally. Resulting derivatives were identified using chromatographic and spectrometric techniques. Nitric oxide synthesis by LPS-stimulated macrophages was assayed to verify whether structural modifications alter the anti-inflammatory activity of diterpenes. Nine compounds (1-9) were identified after acid degradation remaining 5.05% of casearin J. Besides the remaining casearin O (13.1%), eight compounds (10-17) were identified. The dialdehydes from each casearin were the major constituents. S9 rat liver treatment of casearin J and O generated two compounds identical to some of those produced by acid degradation, which remained 36.8% and 36.5% intact, respectively. Both casearins and its derivatives were not cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than 0.312 μg/mL (0.555 μM for casearin J and 0.516 μM for casearin O) and did not inhibit the nitric oxide production in this concentration. Thus, the structural modifications conducted did not alter the activity of casearins and the anti-inflammatory pathway of diterpenes probably is not involved on nitric oxide modulation.",Suppression of Voluntary Ethanol Intake in Mice under Constant Light and Constant Darkness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175946,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 06 08,"Seasonal variations in photoperiod are associated with alterations in human mood and behavior. Similarly, manipulation of the environmental lighting regimen can exert pronounced effects on affective behavior in experimental animals. These observations may be due, in part, to light-induced alterations in circadian rhythms, but it seems likely that other, non-circadian factors also contribute. Several studies have shown that voluntary alcohol (ethanol) consumption can be affected by lighting conditions in rodents, suggesting that photoperiodic variation may account for seasonal and geographic patterns of human alcohol consumption. Nevertheless, the existing animal data are somewhat inconsistent, and little work in this area has been performed in mice. In the present study, we monitored circadian activity rhythms and voluntary ethanol consumption under standard 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycles, and in constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD). Experiment 1 employed male C3H/He inbred mice, while Experiment 2 employed males and females from a genetically heterogeneous line (WSC). Relative to LD conditions, ethanol intake and ethanol preference were reduced under both LL and DD in both experiments. Because similar effects were seen in both LL and DD, neither circadian disruption nor a classical photoperiodic mechanism are likely to account fully for these findings. Instead, we suggest that the absence of circadian entrainment may function as a mild stressor, resulting in reduced ethanol consumption.",An LC-MS/MS method for comparing the stability of ethanol's non-oxidative metabolites in dried blood spots during 90 days.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175945,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 06 08,"Problems of stability were found for biomarkers of alcohol consumption, ethyl glucuronide (EtG), ethyl sulfate (EtS), phosphatidylethanols (PEths) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in whole blood. The purpose of this study was to establish a method for the determination of these 4 kinds of ethanol's non-oxidative metabolites in dried blood spots (DBS) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and to evaluate their stability. In this method, 50 μL of human blood was spotted on a filter paper for DBS analysis. Samples were extracted by methanol, reconstituted by 2-propanol and injected in the LC-MS/MS system. Limits of detection were among 0.5 - 50 ng/mL, deviations in accuracy and precision were all lower than 15% at three quality control levels. The stability of the 4 kinds of ethanol non-oxidative metabolites in DBS was investigated during a 90-day range under 3 temperatures, -20 °C, 4 °C and 25 °C. EtG and EtS showed a high level of stability in DBS in the 90-day range, regardless of the temperature. FAEEs was unstable in 3 days. PEths showed a stability within 15 days in postmortem DBS and 60 days in antemortem DBS respectively at all temperatures.",Solid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system of Sophoraflavanone G: Prescription optimization and pharmacokinetic evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175944,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 06 16,"Sophoraflavanone G (SFG) is promising component in clinical treatment. The purpose of this study was to develop a drug delivery system in order to improve oral bioavailability of SFG. The optimum formulation of Self-microemulsifying Drug Delivery System with SFG (SFG-SMEDDS) was selected by the solubility test, self-microemulsifying grading test and ternary phase diagram test. The optimized formulation of SFG-S-SMEDDS was composed of Ethyl Oleate (38.5%, w/w), Cremophor RH40 (47.5%, w/w), PEG 400 (14.0%, w/w), and drug loading (20 mg/g). Mannitol as a solid absorbent was added to SFG-SMEDDS formulation with the mass adsorption ratio of 2:1 (w/w). The vitro release rate of SFG-S-SMEDDS reached 60% in 10 min and 80% in 30 min. After SD rats were given SFG and SFG-S-SMEDDS by oral administration, it was found that the area under the curve of SFG-S-SMEDDS was significantly larger than that of SFG suspension and the relative bioavailability of SFG in rats was 343.84%. In addition, the SFG-S-SMEDDS did not change greatly within 3 months. Therefore, the results show that SFG-S-SMEDDS can significantly improve the oral bioavailability of SFG so as to lay a foundation of further research on the new dosage form of SFG.",Long-term exposure to fluoride as a factor promoting changes in the expression and activity of cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2) in various rat brain structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175943,Neurotoxicology,2019 06 15,Sixty percent of the mammalian brain is composed of lipids including arachidonic acid (AA). AA released from cell membranes is metabolised in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to prostanoids - biologically active substances involved in the regulation of many processes including inflammation. It has been shown that long-term exposure to fluoride in pre and neonatal period is dangerous because this element is able to penetrate through the placenta and to cross the blood-brain barrier. Exposure to fluoride during the development affects metabolism and physiology of neurons and glia which results in the impairment of cognitive functions but the exact mechanisms of fluoride neurotoxicity are not clearly defined.,Caregiving and infants' neurodevelopment in rural Costa Rica: Results from the Infants' Environmental Health Study (ISA).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175942,Neurotoxicology,2019 06 08,"Early caregiving is one of the strongest influences on children's development, and among the most significant modifiable environmental factor. The aim of this study was to explore the association between quality of caregiver-infant interactions and neurodevelopment of infants living in banana-growing communities in rural Costa Rica characterized as having environmental toxic exposures. Home visits were conducted with 94 caregiver-infant dyads from the Infants' Environmental Health Study (ISA), living within Matina county, Limón province. One-year infant neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development®, Third Edition (Bayley-III). Quality of caregiver-infant interaction was assessed with a standardized observational task: Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Teaching scale (NCATS) around two years of age. Multiple regression analyses examined associations between components of caregiver-infant interactions and neurodevelopmental outcomes, adjusting for mancozeb and manganese exposure and other potential confounders. Compared to NCATS normative data for U.S. Hispanic mothers, 35% of the sample had overall caregiving interaction scores ≤10th percentile cut-off, indicating less than optimal interactions. Higher quality of caregiver-infant interaction was associated with higher expressive communication ability in infants [ß = 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.06)], controlling for pesticide exposure and confounders. Aspects of caregiving such as stimulation and growth-fostering of infants were most strongly associated with language outcomes. Results suggest an association between positive caregiving on language development for infants living in a rural agricultural area in Costa Rica, and highlight aspects of caregiving that could be targeted to improve resilience of these children who live in vulnerable conditions.",A Model to Improve Behavioral Health Integration Into Serious Illness Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175941,Journal of pain and symptom management,2019 06 08,"Behavioral health problems are highly prevalent among people with serious medical illness. Individuals living with these comorbidities have complex clinical and social needs yet face siloed care, high health care costs, and poor outcomes. Interacting factors contribute to these inequalities including historical separation of behavioral and physical health provision. Several care models for integrating behavioral health and general medical care have been developed and tested, but the evidence base focuses primarily on primary care populations and settings. This paper advances that work by proposing a Behavioral Health - Serious Illness Care Model (BH-SIC Model). Developed through a mixed methods approach combining literature review, surveys, interviews, and input from an expert advisory panel, it provides a conceptual framework of building blocks for behavioral health integration tailored to serious illness care populations and the range of settings in which they receive care. The model is intended to serve as foundation to support the development and implementation of integrated behavioral health and serious illness care. The key components of the model are described, barriers to implementation discussed, and recommendations for policy approaches to address these barriers presented.",Sesterterpene MHO7 suppresses breast cancer cells as a novel estrogen receptor degrader.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175940,Pharmacological research,2019 06 16,"Breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women, remains the second in the list of cancer mortality, the majority of these fatalities resulted from estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive disease. ERα is well known for its function on breast cancer initiation and development and has become the most successful biomarker in breast cancers. Ophiobolins are sesterterpene compounds with a distinct tricyclic 5-8-5 ring and have presented anti-cancer activities. MHO7(6-epi-ophiobolin G)was isolated from products of a mangrove fungus in our previous research and demonstrated robust activity against breast cancer cells (BCCs). The investigation on the precise mechanism of MHO7 shows that MHO7 acts as a novel ERα down regulator different from the known molecules in ER + breast cancer cells. A whole-genome transcriptomic analysis on MCF-7 cells treated with MHO7 revealed the estrogen signaling pathway was the most affected pathway, and further evidence showed the de novo synthesis of ESR1 mRNA was inhibited. In addition, MHO7 down-regulated ERα at the protein level through multiple approaches. It not only bound to ERα, pushing helix 11 away in the agonist conformation but also increased the ERα degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These effects consequently caused decreasing of the transcriptional activity of ER modulation which was confirmed by the decreasing of estrogen receptor element (ERE) activity as well as downstream genes expressions like GREB1, BRCA1, MUC1 and CCND1. Combination of tamoxifen and MHO7 yield a synergistic effect on the inhibition of MCF-7 cells when treated around the IC50 values. Our results suggest that MHO7 is a very promising drug candidate and provides a novel drug version on ERα down-regulation to fighting with breast cancer.",Brain accumulation of osimertinib and its active metabolite AZ5104 is restricted by ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175939,Pharmacological research,2019 06 16,"Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR inhibitor registered for advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor recurrent somatic activating mutations in EGFR (EGFRm+) or the frequently occurring EGFR-T790M resistance mutation. Using in vitro transport assays and appropriate knockout and transgenic mouse models, we investigated whether the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 transport osimertinib and whether they influence the oral availability and brain accumulation of osimertinib and its most active metabolite, AZ5104. In vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported osimertinib. In mice, Abcb1a/1b, with a minor contribution of Abcg2, markedly limited the brain accumulation of osimertinib and AZ5104. However, no effect of the ABC transporters was seen on osimertinib oral availability. In spite of up to 6-fold higher brain accumulation, we observed no acute toxicity signs of oral osimertinib in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 knockout mice. Interestingly, even in wild-type mice the intrinsic brain penetration of osimertinib was already relatively high, which may help to explain the documented partial efficacy of this drug against brain metastases. No substantial effects of mouse Cyp3a knockout or transgenic human CYP3A4 overexpression on oral osimertinib pharmacokinetics were observed, presumably due to a dominant role of mouse Cyp2d enzymes in osimertinib metabolism. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 during osimertinib therapy might potentially be considered to further benefit patients with brain (micro-)metastases positioned behind an intact blood-brain barrier, or with substantial expression of these transporters in the tumor cells, without invoking a high toxicity risk."

Overexpression of p38αMAPK has been observed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer patients and in both DU145 and PC-3 cell lines and represents a good drug target. Sulfonamide derivatives have shown biological activities against many human diseases, including cancer. CID-6033590, a sulfonylhydrazide compound, screened from PubChem database by molecular docking with p38αMAPK, was evaluated for anti-cancerous activities. CID-6033590 induced toxicity in both DU145 and PC-3 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 60 μM and 66 μM, respectively. Sub-cytotoxic concentrations of the compound significantly induced S-phase cell cycle arrest, inhibited cyclinA/CDK2 complex and blocked cell proliferation. Further, CID-6033590 downregulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK (P-p38) as well as its downstream targets, Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). The compound increased ROS and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), downregulated Bcl-2 and survivin and cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3, indicating the induction of apoptosis. The evaluaion of the compound on noncancerous, human prostatic epithelial cell line RWPE-1, and healthy murine tissues yielded no significant toxicity. Taken together, we suggest CID-6033590 as a potential candidate for prostate cancer therapy.",Inhibition of formin like 2 promotes the transition of ectopic endometrial stromal cells to epithelial cells in adenomyosis through a MET-like process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175924,Gene,2019 06 16,"EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) is one of the factors in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. FMNL2 induced invasion of cancer cell through promoting EMT, but it is unclear the role of FMNL2 in the adenomyosis. By IHC staining, we found the expression level of FMNL2 was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial stromal cells from women with adenomyosis when compared with normal endometrial stromal cells. Knockdown of FMNL2 inhibited the invasion and migration of ectopic endometrial stromal cells and promoted the protein levels of E-cadherin and Vimentin. Meanwhile, inhibition of FMNL2 could induce the cell membrane localization of E-cadherin. Our findings reveal that the aberrant activation of FMNL2 promotes the pathogenesis of adenomyosis through inducing the EMT process. On the contrary, inhibition of FMNL2 promotes the transition of ectopic endometrial stromal cells to epithelial cells in adenomyosis through a MET-like process.",Novel Non-linear Curve Fitting to Resolve Protein Unfolding Transitions in Intrinsic Fluorescence Differential Scanning Fluorimetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175923,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 06 08,"In biotherapeutic protein research, an estimation of the studied protein's thermal stability is one of the important steps that determine developability as a function of solvent conditions. Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) can be applied to measure thermal stability. Label-free DSF measures amino acid fluorescence as a function of temperature, where conformational changes induce observable peak deformation, yielding apparent melting temperatures. The estimation of the stability parameters can be hindered in the case of multidomain, multimeric or aggregating proteins when multiple transitions partially coincide. These overlapping protein unfolding transitions are hard to evaluate by the conventional methodology, as peak maxima are shifted by convolution. We show how non-linear curve fitting of intrinsic fluorescence DSF can deconvolute highly overlapping transitions in formulation screening in a semi-automated process. The proposed methodology relies on synchronous, constrained fits of the fluorescence intensity, ratio and their derivatives, by combining linear baselines with generalized logistic transition functions. The proposed algorithm is applied to data from three proteins; a single transition, a double separated transition and a double overlapping transition. Extracted thermal stability parameters; apparent melting temperatures Tm,1, Tm,2 and melting onset temperature Tonset are obtained and compared with reference software analysis. The fits show R2 = 0.94 for single and R2 = 0.88 for separated transitions. Obtaining values and trends for Tonset in a well-described and automated way, will aid protein scientist to better evaluate the thermal stability of proteins.",The cytotoxicity of oleanane derived aminocarboxamides depends on their aminoalkyl substituents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175922,Steroids,2019 06 08,"Several oligo-methylene diamine derived carboxamides of oleanolic and maslinic acid have been prepared, and substitutions of the terminal primary amine as well as variations of the length of alkyl chain of the diamine moiety were made. Biological evaluation of their cytotoxic activity was performed using photometric sulforhodamin B assays employing a panel of different human cancer cell lines. These experiments showed most of the carboxamides to be cytotoxic with EC50 values below 10 µM. Prolongation of the alkyl chain length initially reduced EC50 values to a minimum, but a decrease in cytotoxicity was observed for longer alkyl chains. Variation of substituents at the terminal nitrogen atom, however, did not influence EC50 values at all. Noteworthy results were obtained particularly for compounds 4, 6 and 23 as indicated by EC50 values lower than 2 µM, and in case of a maslinic derivative 23 even an increased tumor/non-tumor cell selectivity was observed. These compounds were further investigated using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, which revealed 6 to show indications of apoptosis.",Effects of dexmedetomidine on the steroidogenesis of rat immature Leydig cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175921,Steroids,2019 06 08,"Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an imidazole compound, is an anesthetic drug used perioperatively. In the current study, we investigated the effects of DEX on androgen production in rat immature Leydig cells in vitro. Leydig cells isolated from pubertal Sprague Dawley rats were treated with various concentrations of DEX (0.015-1.5 µM) for 3 h and medium 5α-androstanediol and testosterone levels and the expression of Lhcgr, Scarb1, Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp17a1, Hsd17b3, Srd5a1 and Akr1c14 in Leydig cells were determined. At 0.015-1.5 μM, DEX concentration-dependently inhibited androgen secretion and downregulated Cyp17a1 and Srd5a1 mRNA levels. DEX equally blocked the LH- and cAMP-stimulated secretion of androgens. Using the steroid substrates, 22R-hydroxycholesterol (for cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage), pregnenolone (for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1), progesterone (for cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/C17,C20-lyase), androstenedione (for 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3), testosterone (for steroid 5α-reductase 1), and dihydrotestosterone (for 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), it was demonstrated that DEX inhibited 22R-hydroxycholesterol, pregnenolone, progesterone, and testosterone-mediated 5α-androstanediol formation at 1.5 μM. Further study demonstrated that DEX also directly inhibited rat testis cholesterol side chain cleavage, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenation, and 17α-hydroxylation at 1.5 μM. DEX induced ROS production and increased apoptosis rate in immature Leydig cells after 24-h treatment at ≥0.15 μM. In conclusion, DEX directly inhibits the activities of some steroidogenic enzymes and downregulates the expression of Cyp17a1 and Srd5a1, and increases ROS production, thus leading to lower production of androgens in immature Leydig cells.",A quantitative method for hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA enables distinguishing direct acting antivirals from cell-targeting reagents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175920,Antiviral research,2019 06 08,"Studying the biogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and developing anti-HBV agents both require analytical methods to quantify viral DNA levels inside host cells. The well-accepted Southern blotting method is only semi-quantitative, while the other widely used methods (based on qPCR) have been questioned as to their fidelity for cccDNA quantification. In addition, Southern blotting and qPCR results barely reflect the number of host cells present in an analytical sample. We here developed new techniques that substantially improve cccDNA detection and quantification, including a sample pretreatment method that i) exploits high temperature and exonuclease V digestion (a ATP-dependent, bidirectional exonuclease) to effectively increase the amplification efficiency of HBV cccDNA by removing rcDNA and denaturing the cccDNA template, and ii) a method that splits cell samples and uses separate extraction technologies to facilitate ""host normalization"" based on host genomic DNA signals. Our study introduces new analytical techniques that should be useful for the basic biology and translational studies of HBV.","Ppn2 endopolyphosphatase overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Comparison with Ppn1, Ppx1, and Ddp1 polyphosphatases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175919,Biochimie,2019 06 16,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae has high level of inorganic polyphosphate and a multicomponent system of its metabolism, including polyphosphatases Ppx1, Ppn1, Ddp1, and Ppn2. The aim of the study was to construct the yeast strain overexpressing Ppn2 and to compare the properties of Ppn2, Ppx1, Ppn1, and Ddp1 purified from overexpressing strains of S. cerevisiae. We overexpressed Ppn2 in S. cerevisiae under a strong constitutive promoter of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene and suggested biochemical criteria for distinguishing among yeast polyphosphatases, which is important for their identification and understanding of their functions. Ppn2, Ppn1, and Ddp1 had endopolyphosphatase activities, whereas Ppx1 did not. Ppx1 and Ppn1 exhibited high and Ddp1 and Ppn2 low exopolyphosphatase activity: 240, 500, 0.05 and 0.1 U/mg protein, respectively. The enzymes had distinct patterns of exopolyphosphatase activities stimulation by divalent metal ions. Ppn2, Ppn1 and Ddp1 displayed endopolyphosphatase activity in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+. The endopolyphosphatase activities of Ppn2 and Ppn1 were induced by 0.01 mM of Co2+ or Zn2+, whereas that of Ddp1 required 0.1 mM of these cations. The endopolyphosphatase activity of Ppn1 was inhibited by 0.01 mg mL-1 of heparin, while endopolphosphatase activity of Ppn2 was weakly sensitive to 0.25 mg mL-1 of heparin. The Ppx1 and Ppn1 activity with guanosine tetraphosphate was nearly 80% of activity with long-chain polyphosphates. The Ppn1 hydrolyzed dATP, while Ppx1 did not. The differences in the mode of polyphosphate hydrolysis, substrate specificity, metal ion dependence and cell localization suggest distinct roles of these enzymes in yeast.",Pancreatobiliary-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas may have two subtypes with distinct clinicopathological and genetic features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175918,Human pathology,2019 06 08,"We recently experienced cases of pancreatobiliary-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (PB-IPMNs) with imaging features resembling pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), and histological appearance of purely pancreatobiliary morphology and highly distorted papillary growth, which led to the present study aiming to systematically investigate PB-IPMNs in comparison with PDACs. Surgical cases of PB-IPMNs (n=31) and PDACs (n=24) were examined. PB-IPMNs were classified into monotypic tumors (n=12; 39%) consisting of entirely high-grade pancreatobiliary-type neoplastic cells and polytypic cases (n=19; 61%) associated with components of low-grade dysplasia and/or other histological types (e.g., gastric, intestinal, or oncocytic types). Clinically, monotypic PB-IPMNs less commonly had dilatation of the ampullary orifice (0% vs. 74%) and mucin hypersecretion (17% vs. 89%) than polytypic cases. In most cases of monotypic PB-IPMNs, cystic dilatation of the lesional ducts were less obvious on imaging; therefore, 33% were radiologically diagnosed as PDACs. Histologically, intraductal tumors in monotypic cases showed a highly complex papillary architecture with tubular/cribriform glands and irregular branching, and all these cases were associated with invasive malignancy. GNAS mutations were detected in polytypic PB-IPMNs (6/19; 32%), but there were no GNAS mutations in monotypic cases. The recurrence-free survival of patients with monotypic PB-IPMN or PDAC was similar and significantly worse than that of patients with polytypic PB-IPMN. In conclusion, some cases of monotypic PB-IPMNs lacked the classic characteristics of IPMNs and shared features with PDACs, raising the possibility that these cases may be better classified as a papillary variant of PDACs rather than IPMNs.",Clear Cell Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma: Molecular Profile and Virtual Karyotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175917,Human pathology,2019 06 08,"Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCP-RCC) is a recently-recognized tumor that shares morphologic features of both clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (P-RCC) but behaves in a more indolent fashion.

DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 22 cases of CCP-RCC at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as well as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array were performed on all cases. NGS analysis found 30 somatic variants across 63.3% of cases. Seventeen variants (56.7%) were predicted to be deleterious or possibly/probably damaging. SNP-array analysis found copy-number abnormalities and/or loss of heterozygosity in 22.7% of cases. We analyzed the genetic characteristics of a group of CCP-RCCs cases and found them to be genetically different from one another.

However, the effects of memantine on BPSD-like behaviors in animals have not been well addressed. Here, the effects of memantine on memory disturbance and BPSD-like behaviors were evaluated in thiamine-deficient (TD) mice. Memantine (3 and 10 mg/kg, b.i.d.) was orally administered to ddY mice fed a TD diet for 22 days. During the treatment period, the forced swimming test, elevated plus-maze test, passive avoidance test, and locomotor activity test were performed. Neurotransmitter levels in the brain were analyzed after the treatment period. Daily oral administration of memantine ameliorated the memory disturbances, anxiety-like behavior, and depression-like behavior observed in TD mice. Memantine did not have a significant effect on monoamine levels, but increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus in TD mice. These results suggest that memantine prevents or suppresses the progression of BPSD-like behaviors that develop due to TD. This effect may be mediated in part by the enhancement of glutamatergic neuron activity in the hippocampus."

Currently crude mixtures of lignin peroxidase from fungal fermentation are usually applied to cosmetics due to the intrinsic difficulties of expression and purification. However, the present study focused on heterologous expression and purification of lignin peroxidase isozyme H8 (LiPH8) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and was further used for melanin decolorization. Results revealed that the optimum pH for melanin decolorization using LiPH8 was obtained at pH 4.0. The intermittent feeding of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was effectively elevating melanin decolorization efficiency up to 73%, since excessive H2O2 inactivated LiPH8. For cosmetic application, intermittent feeding of H2O2 is not feasible, thus glucose oxidase (GOx) from Aspergillus niger was employed for in-situ generation of H2O2. By optimizing the GOx and glucose concentrations, a melanin decolorization efficiency up to 63.3 ± 2.4% was obtained within 1 h and continued to 84.0 ± 1.8% in 8 h.

Recently, ferroptosis, a new form of PCD that is dependent on reactive oxygen species and iron, has been described. As with apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy, ferroptosis is associated with a large set of proteins assembled in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, interactability of which is driven by the presence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs). Previous investigations have identified the prevalence and functionality of IDPs/IDPRs in non-ferroptosis PCD. The intrinsic disorder in protein structures is used to increase the regulatory powers of these processes. As uncontrolled PCD is associated with the onset of various pathological traits, uncovering the association between intrinsic disorder and ferroptosis-related proteins is crucial. To understand this association, 31 human ferroptosis-related proteins were analyzed via a multi-dimensional array of bioinformatics and computational techniques. In addition, a disorder meta-predictor (PONDR® FIT) was implored to look at the evolutionary conservation of intrinsic disorder in these proteins. This study presents evidence that IDPs and IDPRs are prevalent in ferroptosis. The intrinsic disorder found in ferroptosis has far-reaching functional implications related to ferroptosis-related PPIs and molecular interactions.",Isolation of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor of capsaicin analogs from Capsicum chinense Jacq. cv.

Macro-angiopathy has alarming signs and symptoms such as those seen with stroke or heart attack, however the presentation of small vessel disease is generally more subtle and therefore usually unnoticed for a long period of time. While it may affect any organ, complications involving the nervous system such as diabetic poly-neuropathy (DPN) are especially debilitating, and it may also be a risk factor for other brain disorders such as dementia. The underlying mechanisms are likely to be multi-faceted, but piling evidence indicates oxidative stress as one of the crucial factors. Here we evaluate the oxidative profile of patients with DM2. The total anti-oxidant capacity appears to be reduced in DM2 with or without complications. Of the specific bio-markers studied, the levels of tissue-damage indicator malon-dialdehyde (MDA) were significantly lower in the DM2 + DPN population only. These results suggest that diabetic patients present with wavering oxidative status, and the low MDA concentrations in patients with complications such as DPN may represent either an exhausted anti-oxidative defense system or a response to anti-inflammatory medications. The findings may also support the use of anti-oxidants such as vitamins A and E.",Progressive myoclonic epilepsy-associated gene Kctd7 regulates retinal neurovascular patterning and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175897,Neurochemistry international,2019 06 08,"Neuron function relies on and instructs the development and precise organization of neurovascular units that in turn support circuit activity. However, our understanding of the molecular cues that regulate this relationship remains sparse. Using a high-throughput screening pipeline, we recently identified several new regulators of vascular patterning. Among these was the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 7 (KCTD7). Mutations in KCTD7 are associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, but how KCTD7 regulates neural development and function remains poorly understood. To begin to identify such mechanisms, we focus on mouse retina, a tractable part of the central nervous system that contains precisely ordered neuron subtypes supported by a trilaminar vascular network. We find that deletion of Kctd7 results in defective patterning of the adult retina vascular network, resulting in increased branching, vessel length, and lacunarity. These alterations reflect early and specific defects in vessel development, as emergence of the superficial and deep vascular layers were delayed. These defects are likely due to a role for Kctd7 in inner retina neurons. Kctd7 it is absent from vessels but present in neurons in the inner retina, and its deletion resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of bipolar cells in development and increased vessel branching in adults. These alterations were accompanied by retinal function deficits. Together, these data suggest that neuronal Kctd7 drives growth and patterning of the vasculature and suggest that neurovascular interactions may participate in the pathogenesis of KCTD7-related human diseases.",Systematic review of targeted extracellular vesicles for drug delivery - Considerations on methodological and biological heterogeneity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175896,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 06 14,"The idea of using extracellular vesicles (EVs) for targeted drug delivery was first introduced in 2011 and has since then gained increasing attention as promising new candidates in the field. Targeting EVs to areas of disease can be achieved through a complex process of designing and inserting a targeting ligand to the surface of the EVs. Although this can be obtained via chemical conjugation, the most important strategy has been to transfect or modulate the EV-producing cell to endow the EVs with the desired targeting capabilities. However, since EVs are harvested from biological sources, their composition is highly heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to control the purity and quality of the resulting EV-based drug delivery vehicles. In this review, we present a detailed account of EVs in targeted drug delivery based on a systematic literature search. We discuss the potential advantages of EVs compared to synthetic lipid-based nanocarriers, and the methodological and biological limitations associated with their use as targeted drug delivery vehicles.",Crossing biological barriers with nanogels to improve drug delivery performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175895,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 06 08,"The current limitations in the use of nanocarriers to treat constantly evolving diseases call for the design of novel and smarter drug delivery systems (DDS).

Particular interest focuses on their application as DDS to minimize severe toxic effects and increase the therapeutic index of drugs. They have recently gained attention, since they can include responsive modalities within their structure, which enable them to excerpt a therapeutic function on demand. Their bigger sizes and controlled architecture and functionality, when compared to non-crosslinked polymers, make them particularly interesting to explore novel modalities to cross biological barriers. The present review summarizes the most significant developments of NGs as smart carriers, with focus on smart modalities to cross biological barriers such as cellular membrane, tumor stroma, mucose, skin, and blood brain barrier. We discuss the properties of each barrier and highlight the importance that the NG design has on their capability to overcome them and deliver the cargo at the site of action."

We hypothesize that mercury sulfide (HgS) is different from HgCl2 and methylmercury (MeHg) in producing intestinal Hg absorption and disruption of gut microbiome. To test this hypothesis, mice were given orally with HgS (α-HgS, 30 mg/kg), Zuotai (β-HgS, 30 mg/kg), HgCl2 (33.6 mg/kg, equivalent Hg as HgS), or MeHg (3.1 mg/kg, 1/10 Hg as HgS) for 7 days. Accumulation of Hg in the duodenum and ileum after HgCl2 (30-40 fold) and MeHg (10-15 fold) was higher than HgS and Zuotai (~2-fold). HgCl2 and MeHg decreased intestinal intake peptide transporter-1 and Ost-β, and increased ileal bile acid binding protein and equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1. The efflux transporters ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member-4 (Abcc4), Abcg2, Abcg5/8, and Abcb1b were increased by HgCl2 and to a lesser extent by MeHg, while HgS and Zuotai had minimal effects. Bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rDNA sequencing. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) results showed that among the 10 phyla, HgS increased Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, while HgCl2 increased Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and decreased Firmicutes; among the 79 families, HgS increased Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Helicobacteraceae, and decreased Prevotellaceae, while HgCl2 increased Odoribacteraceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and decreased Lactobacillaceae; among the 232 genus/species, HgS and Zuotai affected gut microbiome quite differently from HgCl2 and MeHg. qPCR analysis with 16S rRNA confirmed sequencing results. Thus, chemical forms of mercury are a major determinant for intestinal Hg accumulation, alterations in transporters and disruption of microbiome.",Icariin protects mouse Leydig cell testosterone synthesis from the adverse effects of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175881,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 06 08,"Infertility caused by environmental pollution is becoming a global problem, but an effective prevention or treatment is lacking. Icariin (ICA) is a flavonoid used in traditional Chinese medicine. The present study investigated the possible roles of ICA in preventing testicular dysfunction caused by di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), one of the most studied environmental endocrine disruptors. Cultured mouse Leydig cells were pretreated with ICA and exposed to DEHP to determine ICA effects upon cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), testosterone levels and the expression of transcription factor SF-1 and steroidogenic enzymes (CYP11, 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD), which play critical roles in androgen production. Our results showed that ICA reversed the adverse effect of DEHP on Leydig cell proliferation, and decreased ROS levels and elevated Δψm levels. Also, ICA promoted testosterone production and up-regulated the expression of SF-1 and steroidogenic enzymes. We investigated ICA actions in vivo, using male mice administrated DEHP followed by ICA. Exposure to DEHP decreased epididymal sperm counts and disrupted seminiferous tubules, and both of these effects were reversed by ICA treatment. These results showed that the mechanisms of ICA in protecting mouse testes against DEHP-induced damage involves the prevention of ROS accumulation and promotion of testosterone secretion.",Bundling the haystack to find the needle: challenges and opportunities in modeling risk and resilience following early life stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175880,Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2019 06 08,"Various forms of early life adversity (ELA) have been linked with increased risk for negative health outcomes, including neuropsychiatric disorders.

Use of animal models provides a powerful toolset to isolate key variables underlying risk for altered neural and behavioral maturational trajectories. However, a lack of clarity regarding the unique features of differing forms of adversity, lab differences in the implementation and reporting of methods, and the ability compare across labs and types of ELA has led to some confusion.

Stress susceptibility due to a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors plays a major role in the disease etiology, although biological underpinnings have not been clarified. We hypothesized that aberrant functionality of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), a master regulator of experience-dependent epigenetic programming, confers susceptibility to develop PTSD-like symptomatology in the aftermath of traumatic events. Transgenic male mice expressing a truncated form of MeCP2 protein (MeCP2-308) were exposed at adulthood to a trauma in the form of high-intensity footshocks. The presence and duration of PTSD-like symptoms were assessed and compared to those of trauma-exposed wild type littermates and MeCP2-308 mice subjected to a mild stressor. The effects of fluoxetine, a prime pharmacological PTSD treatment, on PTSD-like symptomatology were also explored. Trauma-exposed MeCP2-308 mice showed long-lasting hyperresponsiveness to both correct and incorrect predictors of the trauma and persistent increased avoidance of trauma-related cues. Traumatized MeCP2-308 mice also displayed abnormal post-traumatic plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone and altered peripheral gene expression mirroring that of PTSD patients. Fluoxetine improved PTSD-like symptoms in trauma-exposed MeCP2-308 mice. These findings provide evidence that MeCP2 dysfunction results in increased susceptibility to develop PTSD-like symptoms after trauma exposure, and identify trauma-exposed MeCP2-308 mice as a new tool to investigate the underpinnings of PTSD vulnerability.",IL-13-induced Intestinal secretory epithelial cell antigen passages are required for IgE-mediated food-induced anaphylaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175877,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2019 06 08,Food-induced anaphylaxis is an IgE-dependent immune response that may affect multi-organs and lead to life threatening complications.

An increasing number of studies from the worldwide have reported cat and dog Bartonella infections in recently years. Cats and dogs are the primary reservoir or accidental hosts for Bartonella henselae, the main causal agent of human cat scratch disease. Since pet cat and dog sharing human living environment and have the direct and intimate contact with humans, pet cats and dogs may represent excellent epidemiological sentinels for Bartonella infection in humans. In this study, 475 blood samples were collected from pet cats and dogs in local animal hospitals located at five districts of Shenzhen City, and detected the presence of Bartonella. Bartonella DNA was detected in eight samples collected from pet cats, no positive sample was detected from pet dog samples. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the eight sequences of Bartonella identified here shared the highest identity with B. henselae. Given the intimate contact between pet animals and humans, many attentions should be paid to prevent the Bartonella infections originate from pet cats or dogs, although the Bartonella infection rate in pet cats and dogs might be rather low.",Detection and characterization of tree shrew retinal venous pulsations: An animal model to study human retinal venous pulsations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175860,Experimental eye research,2019 06 08,"Spontaneous retinal venous pulsations (SRVPs), pulsations of branches of the central retinal vein, are affected by intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) and thus convey potentially-useful information about ICP. However, the exact relationship between SRVPs, IOP, and ICP is unknown. It is not easily feasible to study this relationship in humans, necessitating the use of an animal model. We here propose tree shrews as a suitable animal model to study the complex relationship between SRVPs, IOP, and ICP. Tree shrew SRVP incidence was determined in a population of animals. Following validation of a modified IOP control system to accurately and quickly control IOP, IOP and/or ICP were manipulated in two tree shrews with SRVPs and the effects on SRVP properties were quantified. SRVPs were present in 75% of tree shrews at physiologic IOP and ICP. Altering IOP or ICP produced changes in tree shrew SRVP properties; specifically, increasing IOP caused SRVP amplitude to increase, while increasing ICP caused SRVP amplitude to decrease. In addition, a higher IOP was necessary to generate SRVPs at a higher ICP than at a lower ICP. SRVPs occur with a similar incidence in tree shrews as in humans, and tree shrew SRVPs are affected by changes in IOP and ICP in a manner qualitatively similar to that reported in humans. In view of anatomic similarities, tree shrews are a promising animal model system to further study the complex relationship between SRVPs, IOP, and ICP.",Experience with therapeutic drug monitoring of three antifungal agents using an LC-MS/MS method in routine clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175859,Clinical biochemistry,2019 06 08,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of voriconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole is a useful tool for treatment of fungal infections. We validated a simple and reliable LC-MS/MS method using simple protein precipitation for simultaneous determination of voriconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole. The linearity, accuracy, precision, carryover, and matrix effects were validated. Total sample preparation time was <30 min per batch, and analytical run time was 3.8 min per sample. We also presented clinical experience of TDM at 1183 serum concentrations over one year using this validated assay method. About 77%, 85%, and 96% of measured voriconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole concentrations were within the therapeutic range, respectively. The number of respective measurements per patient was 1-63, 1-8, and 1-4 for voriconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole. All three antifungal agents showed large intra-individual variability (2 to 181% CV) and drug-drug interaction with proton pump inhibitors or rifampin. In conclusion, we developed and validated a simple and fast method that was successfully applied in a routine clinical setting.",Clinical-pathological correlations of BAV and the attendant thoracic aortopathies. Part 2: Pluridisciplinary perspective on their genetic and molecular origins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175858,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 06 15,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) arises during valvulogenesis when 2 leaflets/cusps of the aortic valve (AOV) are fused together. Its clinical manifestations pertain to faulty AOV function, the associated aortopathy, and other complications surveyed in Part 1 of the present bipartite-series. Part 2 examines mainly genetic and epigenetic causes of BAV and BAV-associated aortopathies (BAVAs) and disease syndromes (BAVD). Part 1 explored the heterogeneity among subsets of patients with BAV and BAVA/BAVD, and investigated abnormal fluid dynamic stress and strain patterns sustained by the cusps. Specific BAV morphologies engender systolic outflow asymmetries, associated with abnormal aortic regional wall-shear-stress distributions and the expression/localization of BAVAs. Understanding fluid dynamic factors besides the developmental mechanisms and underlying genetics governing these congenital anomalies is necessary to explain patient predisposition to aortopathy and phenotypic heterogeneity. BAV aortopathy entails complex/multifactorial pathophysiology, involving alterations in genetics, epigenetics, hemodynamics, and in cellular and molecular pathways. There is always an interdependence between organismic developmental signals and genes-no systemic signals, no gene-expression; no active gene, no next step. An apposite signal induces the expression of the next developmental gene, which needs be expressed to trigger the next signal, and so on. Hence, embryonic, then post-partum, AOV and thoracic aortic development comprise cascades of developmental genes and their regulation. Interdependencies between them arise, entailing reciprocal/cyclical mutual interactions and adaptive feedback loops, by which developmental morphogenetic processes self-correct responding to environmental inputs/reactions. This Survey can serve as a reference point and driver for further pluridisciplinary BAV/BAVD studies and their clinical translation.",Proteins from Plumeria pudica latex exhibit protective effect in acetic acid induced colitis in mice by inhibition of pro-inflammatory mechanisms and oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175857,Life sciences,2019 06 15,"Latex proteins from P. pudica (LPPp) have anti-inflammatory activity. In the present study, LPPp was evaluated to protect animals against inflammatory ulcerative colitis (UC). UC was induced by intracolonic instillation of a 6% acetic acid solution and the animals received LPPp (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal route 1 h before and 17 h after acetic acid injection. Eighteen hours after instillation of acetic acid, the mice were euthanized and the colons were excised to determine the wet weight, macroscopic and microscopic lesion scores, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, IL1-β levels, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results revealed that LPPp treatment (40 mg/kg) had a protective effect on acetic acid-induced colitis by reducing the wet weight, macroscopic and microscopic scores of intestinal lesions and colonic MPO activity. Additionally, LPPp inhibited tissue oxidative stress, since decreases in GSH consumption, MDA concentration and SOD activity were observed. The treatment with LPPp reduced the levels of cytokine IL-1β, contributing to the reduction of colon inflammation. Biochemical investigation showed that LPPp comprises a mixture of proteins containing proteinases, chitinases and proteinase inhibitors. These data suggest that LPPp has a protective effect against intestinal damage through mechanisms that involve the inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine release and oxidative stress.",Analysis of CRISPR/Cas system of Proteus and the factors affected the functional mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175856,Life sciences,2019 06 08,"The Proteus is one of the most common human and animal pathogens.

The PM has long been considered a physical as well as a biochemical barrier, protecting the midgut epithelium from abrasive food particles, digestive enzymes and pathogens infectious per os. This short review will focus on the latter function, as a barrier to pathogens infectious per os. We focus on the evidence confirming the role of the PM as protective barrier against pathogenic microorganisms of insects, mainly bacteria and viruses, as well as the evolution of a variety of mechanisms used by pathogens to overcome the PM barrier.",Fibroblast growth factor 21 ameliorates pancreatic fibrogenesis via regulating polarization of macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175853,Experimental cell research,2019 06 14,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive, irreversible inflammatory and fibrotic disease. The characteristics of this disease are progressive inflammation, acinar atrophy and fibrosis. Numerous factors are involved in CP such as inflammation, and oxidative stress. Recently, it has been noted that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) reduced the severity of acute pancreatitis in mice. However, whether FGF-21 has effects on CP remains unclear. Thus, the present study was undertaken to detect the effects of FGF-21 on l-arginine induced chronic pancreatitis/islet fibrosis in mice. We used l-arginine to create a CP model in C57BL/6 mice and treated these mice with FGF-21. Compared to normal mice, blood glucose and intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) revealed significant impairment in CP animal model. CP mice also had acinar atrophy, loss of pancreas morphology, inflammatory cells infiltration, extensive deposition of collagen, elevated <alpha>-SMA expression, collagen I expression, serum amylase activity, MPO activity and MDA level. All these pathological changes were significantly improved by FGF-21 treatment. Moreover, FGF-21 ameliorated inflammatory state in the serum, pancreas and peritoneal macrophages of CP mice. Furthermore, we also found that FGF-21 could regulate differentiation of macrophages so as to improve pancreatic fibrogenesis in CP mice. Taken together, our study identifies the beneficial role of FGF-21 in CP and suggests that FGF-21 improves pancreatic fibrogenesis in CP via the mTOR pathway.","Brain energetics plays a key role in the coordination of electrophysiology, metabolism and hemodynamics: evidence from an integrated computational model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175852,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 06 08,"The energetic needs of brain cells at rest and during elevated neuronal activation has been the topic of many investigations where mathematical models have played a significant role providing a context for the interpretation of experimental findings. A recently proposed mathematical model, comprising a double feedback between cellular metabolism and electrophysiology, sheds light on the interconnections between the electrophysiological details associated with changes in the frequency of neuronal firing and the corresponding metabolic activity. We propose a new extended mathematical model comprising a three-way feedback connecting metabolism, electrophysiology and hemodynamics. Upon specifying the time intervals of higher neuronal activation, the model generates a potassium based signal leading to the concomitant increase in cerebral blood flow with associated vasodilation and metabolic changes needed to sustain the increased energy demand. The predictions of the model are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental findings reported in the literature, even predicting a slow after-hyperpolarization of a duration of approximately 16 seconds matching experimental observations."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Targets of AD were obtained by using DisGeNET gene discovery platform, the herbal ingredients target (HIT) database, the SuperPred, and the SwissTargetPrediction compound target prediction platforms. Pathogenic and therapeutic targets were imported to the STRING biological database, and Cytoscape network integration software was used to construct component-target and disease-target interaction networks. Core targets were identified by topological analysis and were further tested to identify the biological processes and signaling pathways. RESULTS Seven key target genes for formononetin in the treatment of patients with AD were identified, including estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), tumor protein p53 (TP53), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cytochrome P450 19A1 (CYP19A1), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2). The biological processes included hormone metabolism, regulation of nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, apoptosis, energy pathways, metabolism, cell communication, and signal transduction. The signaling pathways included histone acetylation and deacetylation (HDAC) class I, regulation of p38-alpha/beta, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor signaling, interleukin-1 (IL1) mediated signaling events, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor signaling pathway, and cytoplasmic and nuclear Smad2/3 signaling. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacological network analysis was used to identify the gene targets and mechanisms of formononetin treatment in patients with AD.",Activation of calcium signaling in human gingival fibroblasts by recombinant Porphyromonas gingivalis RgpB protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175838,European journal of oral sciences,2019 06 08,"Arginine-specific cysteine proteinases, such as Arg-gingipain B (RgpB), mediate inflammation by activating protease-activated receptors (PARs). Arg-gingipain B is produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, and is implicated in the causation of periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to observe the influence of recombinant RgpB protein (rRgpB) on PAR activation by monitoring intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) levels in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). Our findings showed that rRgpB could cause a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. This increase in [Ca2+]i was completely suppressed by vorapaxar, a PAR-1 antagonist. Recombinant Arg-gingipain B increased the concentration of IP3, reaching a maximum at 60 s after treatment; this was completely inhibited by vorapaxar. We therefore conclude that rRgpB-induced calcium signaling in HGFs is mainly caused by PAR-1 activation. This suggests that PAR-1 activation plays a significant role in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease induced by P. gingivalis RgpB.",DNA-segment-capture model for loop extrusion by structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175837,Nucleic acids research,2019 06 08,"Cells possess remarkable control of the folding and entanglement topology of long and flexible chromosomal DNA molecules. It is thought that structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes play a crucial role in this, by organizing long DNAs into series of loops. Experimental data suggest that SMC complexes are able to translocate on DNA, as well as pull out lengths of DNA via a 'loop extrusion' process. We describe a Brownian loop-capture-ratchet model for translocation and loop extrusion based on known structural, catalytic, and DNA-binding properties of the Bacillus subtilis SMC complex. Our model provides an example of a new class of molecular motor where large conformational fluctuations of the motor 'track'-in this case DNA-are involved in the basic translocation process. Quantitative analysis of our model leads to a series of predictions for the motor properties of SMC complexes, most strikingly a strong dependence of SMC translocation velocity and step size on tension in the DNA track that it is moving along, with 'stalling' occuring at subpiconewton tensions. We discuss how the same mechanism might be used by structurally related SMC complexes (Escherichia coli MukBEF and eukaryote condensin, cohesin and SMC5/6) to organize genomic DNA.",Productive Oilseed Rape Strips Supplement Seminatural Field-Margins in Promoting Ground-Dwelling Predatory Invertebrates in Agricultural Landscapes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175836,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 06 13,"Intensively managed flowering crops like canola (Brassicales: Brassicaceae) (oilseed rape, OSR) provide significant short-term nectar resources for pollen consumers. They may also play important roles as annual ""service strips"" in temporarily promoting predatory invertebrates. We set out to test this assumption by comparing overall and functional group-specific species richness, activity density, and assemblage composition of carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae), in three types of service strips-OSR, woody, and grassy strips established in direct vicinity to cropland. OSR strips were found to harbor the highest carabid species richness and activity density of small carabids. The activity density of carabids overall and of omnivorous species, the species richness and activity density of spiders across size classes and feeding strategies were all significantly reduced in woody strips. The percentage of seminatural habitat in the wider landscape was positively linked to the activity density of spiders overall, ground hunting and large spiders, whereas in carabids, positive effects were limited to large species occurring in grassy strips. Habitat type was the main predictor of both carabid and spider assemblage composition. Our results indicate that carabid and spider activity density across functional groups responded more strongly to changes in the landscape composition than the diversity of individual taxonomic groups. For agricultural landscape management, the establishment of habitat mosaics that include regular OSR could promote abundant, species-rich predatory invertebrates particularly in early spring. In contrast, structurally homogenous woody strips represent limited value in promoting the investigated biological pest control agents.",A Comparative Whole Genome Sequence Analysis Leads to Identification of Repeat-Associated Evolutionarily Conserved miRNAs in Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175835,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 06 13,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs, which play important regulatory roles in various biological processes. In this study, we have developed a computational approach for detecting conserved miRNAs based on comparison of whole genome sequences of closely related species by considering various key features of experimentally validated miRNAs. By applying this approach, we have identified 34 new miRNAs from Bombyx mori (L.), which are also conserved in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae). Most of these miRNAs were associated with repeat region of the genome. We did an expression analysis of the 34 newly predicted miRNAs and found that 30 of these miRNAs are expressing in different tissues of B. mori. Besides, we have also predicted the putative targets of these miRNAs in B. mori based on several known characteristic features of miRNA::mRNA duplexes and found that these targets include diverse range of functions, suggesting multiple layers of gene regulation of various important biological processes.","Screening Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) Populations From Pernambuco, Brazil for Resistance to Temephos, Diflubenzuron, and Cypermethrin and Characterization of Potential Resistance Mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175834,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 06 13,"Resistance to chemical insecticides detected in Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes has been a problem for the National Dengue Control Program (PNCD) over the last years. In order to provide deeper knowledge of resistance to xenobiotics, our study evaluated the susceptibility profile of temephos, diflubenzuron, and cypermethrin insecticides in natural mosquito populations from the Pernambuco State, associating these results with the local historical use of such compounds. Furthermore, mechanisms that may be associated with this particular type of resistance were characterized. Bioassays with multiple temephos and diflubenzuron concentrations were performed to detect and quantify resistance. For cypermethrin, diagnostic dose assays were performed. Biochemical tests were carried out to quantify the activity of detoxification enzymes. In addition, a screening of mutations present in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (NaV) was performed in samples previously submitted to bioassays with cypermethrin. The populations under study were resistant to temephos and showed a positive correlation between insecticide consumption and the resistance ratio (RR) to the compound. For diflubenzuron, the biological activity ratio (BAR) ranged from 1.3 to 4.7 times, when compared to the susceptible strain. All populations showed resistance to cypermethrin. Altered enzymatic profiles of alpha, p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) esterases and glutathione-S-transferases were recorded in most of these samples. Molecular analysis demonstrated that Arcoverde was the only population that presented the mutated form 1016Ile/Ile. These findings show that the situation is critical vis-à-vis the effectiveness of mosquito control using chemical insecticides, since resistance to temephos and cypermethrin is widespread in Ae. aegypti from Pernambuco.","Discovery of Aphis ruborum (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Aphelinus varipes (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) on Cultivated Strawberry in Mississippi, USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175831,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 06 13,"An adventive aphid and novel host-parasitoid association from cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananessa Duch. cv. Chandler; Fragaria × ananessa Duch. cv. Camarosa) in Mississippi, USA are reported herein. The aphid, first detected in high tunnel cultivation, was found predominately on newly emerged, not fully developed leaflets of daughter plants in the Fall of 2016. By 2017, aphids and their associated mummies were observed on fully developed leaflets on mother plants of both cultivars. The aphid was identified as Aphis ruborum (Börner & Schilder) using morphology and DNA barcoding studies. In addition, DNA barcoding identified parasitoid adults emerging from aphid mummies as two cryptic species, Aphelinus varipes (Foerster) and Aphelinus albipodus Hayat and Fatima. Occurrence of A. ruborum in Mississippi represents a new state record and the eastern-most established record in the United States.

However, its involvement in hepatic fibrosis remains unclear. In the current study, we wanted to clarify, in vivo, the role of HBx protein in the development of liver fibrosis. Mice transgenic for the full-length HBx (FL-HBx) were used. To create liver fibrosis, FL-HBx transgenic and control mice were chronically exposed to CCl4. Modulation of the expression of proteins involved in matrix remodeling, hepatic metabolism and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were investigated. In transgenic mice, FL-HBx expression potentiates CCl4-induced liver fibrosis with increased expression of proteins involved in matrix remodeling (Collagen, α-Sma, PdgfR-β, MMP-13). In FL-HBx transgenic mice, an increase in EMT was observed with a higher transcription of two inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β) and a decrease of glutamine synthetase expression level. This was associated with a sustained cell cycle and hepatocyte polyploidy alteration consistent with p38 and ERK1/2 overactivation, increase of PLK1 transcription, accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 protein and increase expression of Beclin-1. This correlates with a higher expression of tumor progenitor cell markers (AFP, Ly6D and EpCam); indicating a higher risk of progression from fibrosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the presence of FL-HBx protein. In conclusion, our results show that FL-HBx protein enhances the development of liver fibrosis and contributes to the progression of liver disease from chronic hepatitis to HCC.",Chemical and physical influence of sodic soils on the coleoptile length and root growth angle of wheat genotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175829,Annals of botany,2019 06 08,High exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and bulk density of sodic soils can reduce seedling emergence.

Computation of the RMSTD relies on the choice of a time horizon, $\tau$. In a meta-analysis, varying follow-up durations may lead to the exclusion of RCTs with follow-up shorter than $\tau$. We introduce an individual patient data multivariate meta-analysis model for RMSTD estimated at multiple time horizons. We derived the within-trial covariance for the RMSTD enabling the synthesis of all data by borrowing strength from multiple time points. In a simulation study covering 60 scenarios, we compared the statistical performance of the proposed method to that of two univariate meta-analysis models, based on available data at each time point and based on predictions from flexible parametric models. Our multivariate model yields smaller mean squared error over univariate methods at all time points. We illustrate the method with a meta-analysis of five RCTs comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with surgical replacement in patients with aortic stenosis. Over 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up, those treated by TAVR live 0.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.56], 0.46 (95% CI $-$0.08 to 1.01), and 0.79 (95% CI $-$0.43 to 2.02) months longer on average compared to those treated by surgery, respectively."

In these individuals, the consumption of lactose-containing milk and dairy products can lead to the development of various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The primary solution to lactose intolerance is withdrawing lactose from the diet either by eliminating dairy products altogether or substituting lactose-free alternatives. However, studies have shown that certain individuals erroneously attribute their GI symptoms to lactose and thus prefer to consume lactose-free products. This has raised the question whether consuming lactose-free products reduces an individual's ability to absorb dietary lactose and if lactose-absorbers should thus avoid these products. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the acclimatization of lactose processing in humans. Human studies that have attempted to induce intestinal lactase expression with different lactose feeding protocols have consistently shown lack of enzyme induction. Similarly, withdrawing lactose from the diet does not reduce intestinal lactase expression. Evidence from cross-sectional studies shows that milk or dairy consumption is a poor indicator of lactase status, corroborating the results of intervention studies. However, in lactase-deficient individuals, lactose feeding supports the growth of lactose-digesting bacteria in the colon, which enhances colonic lactose processing and possibly results in the reduction of intolerance symptoms. This process is referred to as colonic adaptation. In conclusion, endogenous lactase expression does not depend on the presence of dietary lactose, but in susceptible individuals, dietary lactose might improve intolerance symptoms via colonic adaptation. For these individuals, lactose withdrawal results in the loss of colonic adaptation, which might lower the threshold for intolerance symptoms if lactose is reintroduced into the diet.",Steady Growth in Early Infancy Is Associated with Greater Anthropometry in Indian Children Born Low Birth Weight at Term.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175812,The Journal of nutrition,2019 06 08,Patterns of early growth are associated with later body composition and risk of adult noncommunicable disease but information from low-income countries is limited.,Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Affects Lipid Metabolism via Changing Gut Microflora and Enhancing Propionate Production in Weaned Pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175811,The Journal of nutrition,2019 06 08,It is not clear whether dietary grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) affects mammalian lipid metabolism via the gut microbiota.,"Effects of animal protein supplementation of mothers, preterm infants, and term infants on growth outcomes in childhood: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175810,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2019 06 08,"Child stunting is a major public health problem, afflicting 155 million people worldwide.

Residual feed intake was measured in growing Santa Gertrudis steers (Study 1; n = 57; initial BW = 291.1 ± 33.8 kg) and Brangus heifers (Study 2; n = 468; initial BW = 271.4 ± 26.1 kg) fed a high-roughage based diet (ME = 2.1 Mcal/kg DM) for 70 d in a Calan gate feeding barn. Animals were ranked by RFI based on performance and feed intake measured from d 0 to d 70 (Study 1) or d 56 (Study 2) of the trial, and 20 animals with the lowest and highest RFI were identified for subsequent collections of fecal and feed refusal samples for DM and nutrient digestibility analysis. In Study 2, rumen fluid and feces were collected for in vitro methane producing activity (MPA) and VFA analysis in trials 2, 3, and 4. Residual feed intake classification did not affect BW or BW gain (P 0.05), but low RFI steers and heifers consumed 19% less (P 0.01) DMI compared to high RFI animals. Steers with low RFI tended (P < 0.1) to have higher DM digestibility (DMD) compared to high RFI steers (70.3 vs. 66.5 ± 1.6% DM). Heifers with low RFI had 4% higher DMD (76.3 vs. 73.3 ± 1.0% DM) and 4 to 5% higher (P 0.01) CP, NDF, and ADF digestibility compared to heifers with high RFI. Low RFI heifers emitted 14% less (P < 0.01) methane (% GE intake; GEI) calculated according to Blaxter and Clapperton (1965) as modified by Wilkerson et al. (1995), and tended (P = 0.09) to have a higher rumen acetate:propionate ratio than heifers with high RFI (GEI = 5.58 vs. 6.51 ± 0.08 %; A:P ratio = 5.02 vs. 4.82 ± 0.14 %). Stepwise regression analysis revealed significant apparent nutrient digestibilites for Study 1 (DMD) and Study 2 (DMD and NDF digestibility), which accounted for an additional 8 (heifers) and 6% (steers) of the variation in intake when added to the base model (ADG and mid-test BW0.75).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Bioinformatics mining methods were used to predict the differential expression levels of FAM83A mRNA in LUAD and normal lung tissues based on the TCGA and Oncomine databases. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to demonstrate the FAM83A protein expression levels in 83 cases of LUAD combined with paired normal lung tissues. The correlation between clinicopathologic factors and FAM83A differential expression levels in LUAD was explored by the chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier univariate and Cox multivariate survival analyses were performed to investigate the clinical prognostic value of FAM83A expression in LUAD patients. RESULTS Results from TCGA and Oncomine databases revealed that FAM83A mRNA expression level was significantly higher in LUAD than that in normal lung tissues (both P<0.05). Immunohistochemical findings demonstrated that the high positive rate of FAM83A in LUAD was 73.49% (61/83), while that of matched normal lung tissues was only 22.89% (19/83). Moreover, LUAD patients with FAM83A mRNA or high protein levels had dramatically lower OS times than those with FAM83A mRNA or low protein levels (All P<0.05). Lastly, Cox multivariate survival analysis showed that FAM83A differential expression level (low vs. high) was the only independent factor predicting the prognosis of LUAD patients (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS FAM83A was overexpressed in LUAD, and FAM83A overexpression could be used as an independent factor of poor prognosis in LUAD patients.",Insect bites as the cause of infectious and allergic inflammatory processes of the maxillofacial area in children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175803,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",2019 06 08,Introduction: The part of purulent inflammatory processes (IP) of the maxillofacial area (MFA) as a result of insect bites are increased.

Thanks to modern forms of physio- and kinesiotherapy, it is possible to adapt therapeutic methods to the individual needs and clinical condition of the patient. Such individualization of treatment in physiotherapy is the main goal of the above methods in palliative and hospice treatment. Due to the dynamics onset of cancer in the group of geriatric patients there is a need for a broader analysis of the topic. The work presents available information of physiotherapy in palliative and hospice care. The problem of relative and absolute indications and contraindications for physiotherapy was discussed.

These effects have important implications for the use of exercise in neurorehabilitation. Here, we aimed to determine whether increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) induced by 18 sessions of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) over 6 weeks were accompanied by changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical excitatory and inhibitory circuits, serum biochemical markers and working memory (WM) capacity in sedentary, healthy, young males. We assessed motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) both at rest and during tonic contraction, intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We also examined serum levels of BDNF, IGF-1, total and precursor (pro) cathepsin B (CTSB), as well as WM capacity. Compared to pretraining, CRF was increased and ICF reduced after the HIIT intervention, but there were no changes in corticospinal excitability, SICI, BDNF, IGF-1, total and pro-CTSB, and WM capacity. Further, greater CRF gains were associated with larger decreases in total and pro-CTSB and, only in Val/Val carriers, with larger increases in SICI. Our findings confirm that HIIT is efficacious in promoting CRF and show that corticospinal excitability, biochemical markers, and WM are unchanged after 18 HIIT bouts in sedentary males.

Here, we report a systematic structural and thermodynamic analysis of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) variants that are significantly stabilized through a single amino acid substitution at residue 38, which is located in a loop mostly exposed on the protein surface. Differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the BPTI-[5,55]Gly14 variants were stabilized in an enthalpy-driven manner and that the magnitude of the stabilization increased as the hydrophobicity of residue 38 increased. This increase in the thermal stability of BPTI was unexpected because a hydrophobic residue on a protein surface is usually destabilizing. To identify the structural determinants of this stabilization, we determined the structures of six BPTI-[5,55]Gly14 variants (Gly14 Gly38 , Gly14 Ala38 , Gly14 Val38 , Gly14 Leu38 , Gly14 Ile38 , and Gly14 Lys38 ), which retained essentially the same structure as the wild-type BPTI. A detailed examination indicated that the extent of thermal stabilization correlated with both improved local packing and increased hydration around the substitution sites. In particular, the number of water molecules near residue 38 increased upon its mutation to a hydrophobic residue, suggesting that improved hydration contributed to the enthalpy-driven stabilization. Increasing a protein's thermal stability by the placement of a hydrophobic amino acid on the protein surface is a novel and unexpected phenomenon, and its exact nature is worth further examination, as it may provide a generic method for stabilizing proteins in an enthalpy-driven manner.

The goal of this review is to critically appraise the assays and properties used to identify stem cells in the adult salivary gland, and to consider the caveats of each. Re-evaluation of the defining criteria may help to reconcile the many potential stem cell populations described in the salivary gland, in order to increase comparability between studies and build consensus in the field.

Although it has been reported that CRCs with PDCs showed frequent lymph node metastases with a worse prognosis, the molecular markers of PDCs that are responsible for prognosis have not been identified. We here noticed for the first time that Ezrin, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, is expressed in the corner cells of PDCs. We then aimed to verify whether heterogeneous Ezrin expression in PDCs predicts the prognosis of CRC patients. We immunohistochemically analyzed Ezrin expression in PDCs of 184 patients with completely resected stages I to III CRCs. We established the Ezrin Corner Score (ECS), which quantifies the tendency of Ezrin-positive cells to accumulate at the corners of PDCs. On the basis of ECS values, 2 indices, the mean ECS and the number of PDCs with high ECS, were obtained. Both indices were significantly higher in CRCs with lymphatic invasion, higher PDC grade, and the presence of micropapillary (MP) PDCs. The mean ECS-high group showed shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) than the mean ECS-low group, but without significance. The other index, the number of ECS-high PDCs, was significantly associated with RFS. These results suggest that Ezrin is involved in PDC progression and lymphatic invasion, and that ECS may be a marker for aggressive PDCs. This article is protected by copyright.

Part A,2019 06 08,"Peptide and proteins are recognized as highly selective and therapeutically active biomaterials, as well as relatively safe in clinical application. A calcium phospholipid-binding protein, copine VII (CPNE7), has been recently identified to induce hard tissue regeneration, including bone and dentin by internalizing into the cells. However, the clinical application of the full length of CPNE7 has limited due to its large size with short half-life. Herein, as an alternative to CPNE7, six bioactive synthetic peptides are designed from CPNE7 (CPNE7-derived peptides, CDP1-6) and investigated their osteogenic potential. Among the CDPs, CDP4 have the highest level of cell-penetrating activity as well as osteogenic efficiency in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). CDP4 increased the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and proteins, which was comparable to that by BMP-2. The cell penetration capacity of CDP4 may synergistically induce the osteogenic potential of DPSCs. Moreover, the implantation of the mixture of CDP4 with injectable collagen gel increased bone formation with recovery in the mouse calvarial defect model, comparable to full length CPNE7 and even BMP-2. In conclusion, these results suggest that our synthetic peptide, CDP4, can be applied in combination with biomaterial to provide high osteogenic efficacy in the field of bone tissue engineering.

Despite this, experimental tests of the healthy herds hypothesis, wherein predators influence pathogen transmission, are rare. Moreover, no studies have separated effects mediated by density vs. traits. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment, we investigated the interactive effects of predatory dragonfly larvae (caged or lethal [free-ranging]) and a viral pathogen, ranavirus, on larval amphibians (gray treefrogs and northern leopard frogs). We determined the influence of predators on ranavirus transmission and the relative importance of density- and trait-mediated effects on observed patterns. Lethal predators reduced ranavirus infection prevalence by 57-83% compared to no-predator and caged-predator treatments. The healthy-herds effect was more strongly associated with reductions in tadpole density than behavioral responses to predators. We also assessed whether ranavirus altered the responses of tadpoles to predators. In the absence of virus, tadpoles reduced activity levels and developed deeper tails in the presence of predators. However, there was no evidence that virus presence or infection altered responses to predators. Finally, we compared the magnitude of trophic cascades initiated by individual and combined natural enemies. Lethal predators initiated a trophic cascade by reducing tadpole density, but caged predators and ranavirus did not. The absence of a virus-induced trophic cascade is ostensibly the consequence of limited virus-induced mortality and the ability of infected individuals to continue interacting within the community. Our results provide support for the healthy herds hypothesis in amphibian communities. We uniquely demonstrate that density-mediated effects of predators outweigh trait-mediated effects in driving this pattern. Moreover, this study was one of the first to directly compare trophic cascades caused by predators and pathogens. Our results underscore the importance of examining the interactions between predators and pathogens in ecology. This article is protected by copyright.

Although this visual categorization function is traditionally investigated from a unisensory perspective, its early development is inherently constrained by multisensory inputs. In particular, an early-maturing sensory system such as olfaction is ideally suited to support the immature visual system in infancy by providing stability and familiarity to a rapidly changing visual environment. Here we test the hypothesis that rapid visual categorization of salient visual signals for the young infant brain, human faces, is shaped by another highly relevant human-related input from the olfactory system, the mother's body odor. We observe that a right-hemispheric neural signature of single-glance face categorization from natural images is significantly enhanced in the maternal vs. a control odor context in individual 4-month-old infant brains. A lack of difference between odor conditions for the common brain response elicited by both face and non-face images rules out a mere enhancement of arousal or visual attention in the maternal odor context. These observations show that face-selective neural activity in infancy is mediated by the presence of a (maternal) body odor, providing strong support for multisensory inputs driving category acquisition in the developing human brain and having important implications for our understanding of human perceptual development.

Here, we investigate electrophysiological signatures of proactive control. Previously, the contingent negative variation (CNV) in the ERPs and oscillatory power in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha band (8-14 Hz) have been suggested as signatures of control implementation. However, experimental designs did not always separate control implementation from motor preparation. Critically, we used a mental calculation task to investigate effects of proactive control implementation on the CNV and on theta and alpha power, in absence of motor preparation. In the period leading up to task onset, we found a more negative CNV, increased theta power, and decreased alpha power for hard versus easy calculations, showing increased proactive control implementation when a difficult task was expected. These three measures also correlated with behavioral performance, both across trials and across subjects. In addition to scalp EEG in healthy participants, we collected intracranial local field potential recordings in an epilepsy patient. We observed a slow-drift component that was more pronounced for hard trials in a hippocampal location, possibly reflecting task-specific preparation for hard mental calculations. The current study thus shows that difficulty information triggers proactive control in absence of motor preparation and elucidates its neurophysiological signatures.",Alcohol supply as a favour for a friend: Scenarios of alcohol supply to younger friends and siblings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175675,Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 06 08,Adolescents under the legal purchase age primarily source their alcohol through social networks.

These semi-voluntary motor and phonic manifestations are typically aggravated by exposure to acute stress, yet the mechanisms underlying this exacerbation remain unclear. Using a well-characterized animal model of TS, the D1CT-7 mouse, we recently showed that acute stress increases tic-like responses and causes sensorimotor gating deficits, as measured by the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle. We showed that these effects are promoted by the brain synthesis of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP). In line with this idea, inhibition of AP synthesis by finasteride was found to suppress the tic-exacerbating effects of stress; conversely, AP administration resulted in a marked enhancement of the number of tic-like motor bursts. Given that the primary mechanism of AP is based on the positive allosteric modulation of GABA-A receptors, here we hypothesized that the enhancement in tic-like behaviors induced by either stress or AP may be countered by isoallopregnanolone (isoAP), the natural 3β-epimer of AP that acts as an antagonist to the AP-binding site within GABA-A receptors. In agreement with our hypothesis, isoAP (5-10 mg/kg, SC) dose-dependently reduced the number of tic-like behaviors induced by stress in D1CT-7 mice. These effects were comparable to those elicited by both the benchmark TS therapy haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg, IP), as well as finasteride (25 mg/kg, IP). IsoAP also countered the prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits secondary to stress in D1CT-7 mice. Finally, isoAP opposed the enhancement of tic-like behaviors induced by AP (15 mg/kg, IP). Given that isoAP is well-tolerated and has an optimal safety profile, these data suggest that this steroid may have therapeutic properties in TS. This article is protected by copyright.

Current standard-of-care treatment for stroke deploys intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), mechanical thrombolysis, or delivery of fibrinolytics. Although these therapies have reduced stroke-induced damage, therapeutic options still remain limited. Transplantation of patient-specific neural stem (NS) cells represents a promising strategy for the treatment of stroke. Basic science research has shown that transplanted NS cells can differentiate in the brain of rodent models of stroke and promote behavioral recovery. Clinical trials exploring the feasibility of stem cell treatment for stroke are currently being conducted. However, questions remain regarding the optimal means of delivering NS cells, including cell dose, infusion speed, timing of transplantation, anatomic site, and imaging-assisted monitoring and guidance. Of the different available delivery modalities, intravascular NS delivery after stroke represents one practical approach. In this chapter, I provide methods for intravascular delivery of NS cells in a mouse model of stroke. The techniques involved include cell culture of NS cells, flow cytometry of NS cells, modeling stroke via unilateral common carotid artery occlusion, intra-arterial injection of NS cells into the brain, behavior analyses, and immunohistochemistry.

This chapter describes adjusted methods for cultivation of PS cells from different primate species, including African green monkey, rhesus monkey, chimpanzee, and human. Supplementation of E8 medium and inhibitors of the Tankyrase and GSK3 kinases to various primate PS cell media reduce line-dependent predisposition for spontaneous differentiation in conventional PS cell cultures. We provide methods for basic characterization of primate PS cell lines, which include immunostaining for pluripotency markers such as OCT4 and TRA-1-60, as well as in vivo teratoma formation assay.

In these human-chick chimeras, the human organizer cells self-organize to contribute directly to notochord-like tissue and indirectly induce host chick cells to generate neural tissue.",Informed Consent Issues for Cell Donors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175646,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 08,"Stem cell-based chimera research depends on the free and voluntary provision of human biomaterials necessary for the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines. Informed consent requirements for the procurement of human embryos, gametes, and somatic cells must take into account unique features of biomedical research involving the use of immortal cell lines that carry their donors' genetic information. The extent and basis for donors' rights, including the right to withdraw from research, are explored here in detail.","Cancer Stem Cells: Concepts, Challenges, and Opportunities for Cancer Therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175645,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 08,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells with self-renewal capacity, that fuel tumor growth and contribute to the heterogeneous nature of tumors. First identified in hematological malignancies, CSC populations have to date been proposed in solid tumors in various organs. In vitro and in vivo assays, mouse genetic models, and more recently single-cell sequencing technologies and other '-omics' methodologies have not only facilitated the identification of novel CSC populations but also revealed and clarified novel properties of CSCs. Increasingly, both cell-autonomous and CSC niche factors are recognized as important contributors of CSC properties. The deepened understanding of CSC properties and characteristics would enable and facilitate the rational design of CSC-specific therapeutics that would, ideally, have high selectivity for cancer cells, eliminate tumor bulk, and prevent tumor recurrence. Addressing these issues would form some of the key challenges of the CSC research field in the coming years.",Derivation of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175644,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 08,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a curative treatment for hematologic malignancies and innate immunodeficiency, but its applications are limited to matched donors, and the availability of umbilical cord blood of immune types. Therefore, derivation of HSCs from patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is a holy grail in regenerative medicine. However, derivation of HSCs from iPSCs has proven elusive. Here, the authors developed a method to derive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by combining two established methods. The first method mimics embryonic development by directed differentiation of iPSCs into a cellular state termed hemogenic endothelium (HE) by stepwise exposure to different combinations of morphogens and cytokines. In the second method, transcription factors are induced in HE cells for specification into HSCs. By combining these approaches, the authors identified a set of select transcription factors that programmed HE cells into HSPCs with long-term and multilineage capacity in vivo. In this chapter, I provide an overview of this technology, technical tips, and future applications.",Highly Efficient Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Preimplantation and Postimplantation Embryos in Serum-Free Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175643,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 08,"Pluripotency refers to the potential of cells to generate all cell types of the embryo proper. Pluripotency spans a spectrum of cellular states. At one polar extreme is naïve pluripotency, which is identified based on the potential to form germline chimeras. At the other polar extreme is primed pluripotency, in which pluripotent cells are primed to differentiate. Mouse naïve PS cells can be derived from preimplantation embryos. Primed epiblast stem (EpiS) cells are typically isolated from epiblasts of early postimplantation mouse embryos. In this chapter, we describe protocols for highly efficient derivation and propagation of murine naïve and primed PS cell lines in serum-free conditions from preimplantation and postimplantation embryos. We describe generation of mouse naïve PS cells using LIF and inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 kinases and of mouse primed PS cells using FGF2 and IWR1 compound which induces the stabilization of Axin proteins."

By reducing financial barriers to biological therapies, biosimilars play a part in budgetary redistribution and, hence, in increasing patients' access to treatment. They also foster innovation and deliver other non-price-driven advantages. However, the market is such that harmonization of pricing of reference biologics and biosimilars may dissuade physicians from prescribing biosimilars and often creates an unfavorable market environment for the launch of biosimilars. Such dynamics result in a high cost by denying patients the full benefits and added value inherent in biosimilar agents.

In studies of SCAs 1, 2, 3, and 6, eye movement abnormalities correlate with disease severity. Oculomotor abnormalities may be the sole motor manifestation of early and/or premanifest disease; however, not all ataxia rating scales include oculomotor assessment. We sought to identify the prevalence and characteristics of oculomotor abnormalities at first presentation in a large SCA cohort, including those in earlier stages of disease. We performed a retrospective assessment of initial clinical examinations of SCA patients followed in the Massachusetts General Hospital Ataxia Unit and assessed with the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). One hundred thirty-four SCA patients were assessed: 17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 55 SCA3, 2 SCA5, 22 SCA6, 11 SCA7, 9 SCA8, and 5 SCA17, mainly in the early stages of disease (67.2% stage 0-1). Oculomotor abnormalities were present on initial assessment in 94.8%, including 7/9 stage 0 and 77/81 stage 1 patients. Stage 0/1 patients had frequent saccadic intrusions, nystagmus, and hypo/hypermetric saccades. Saccadic slowing was present even in early stage SCA7 and SCA2, eventually leading to ophthalmoplegia. The burden of oculomotor abnormalities correlated with disease stage, duration, and severity, remaining highly significant even when controlling for age. The ubiquitous presence of oculomotor abnormalities in the SCAs, particularly early in the course, underscores the importance of oculomotor assessment in ataxia rating scales such as BARS. These findings highlight the potential for quantitative physiological oculomotor measures as clinical biomarkers in natural history studies and clinical trials.",Understanding the Role of the Gut Microbiome and Microbial Metabolites in Obesity and Obesity-Associated Metabolic Disorders: Current Evidence and Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175629,Current obesity reports,2019 06 08,"In this review, we summarize current evidence on the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites in relation to obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

These cystic tumors represent 15-30% of cystic lesions of the pancreas [Basturk et al. in Am J Surg Pathol 39(12):1730-1741, 1; Ferrone et al. in Arch Surg (Chicago, Ill: 1960) 144(5):448-454, 2, Kosmahl et al. in Virchows Arch Int J Pathol 445(2):168-178, 3; Spinelli et al. in Ann Surg. 239(5):651-657, 4]. It is believed that IPMN can progress from low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to invasive cancer, and this pathway of progression accounts for 20-30% of pancreatic cancer [Adsay et al. in Am J Surg Pathol 28(7):839-848, 5; Tanaka et al. in J Gastroenterol 40(7):669-675, 6; Wu et al. in Sci Transl Med 3(92):92ra66, 7]. Furthermore, it is also widely believed that IPMN represent a field defect of the pancreas in which the entire ductal system is at risk of developing invasive carcinoma, not only in the area of radiographically detectable IPMN, and thus the remaining gland should undergo surveillance after partial pancreatectomy [Salvia et al. in Ann Surg 239(5):678-685, 8; Izawa et al. in Cancer 92(7):1807-1817, 9; Yamaguchi and Tanaka in Jpn J Clin Oncol 41(7):836-840, 10]. Increasingly, surgeons are faced with the dilemma between recommending highly complex resections-that have significant morbidity and mortality-in patients who may have low-risk IPMN (low-grade dysplasia), or alternatively, recommending observation for those who could possibly be harboring a radiographically occult malignancy. Given the complexity of the management decisions for patients with IPMN, the purpose of this paper is to review the current literature and to provide a summary of how accurate we are currently with the identification of high-grade dysplasia or progression to carcinoma in patients who present with IPMN.","Inhibition of Rat CYP1A2 and CYP2C11 by Honokiol, a Component of Traditional Chinese Medicine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175627,European journal of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019 06 08,"Honokiol, a major constituent isolated from Magnolia officinalis, is regarded as a phytochemical marker and bioactive substance present in many traditional Chinese medicines.

Is cell signaling sometimes encrypted?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175621,Theory in biosciences = Theorie in den Biowissenschaften,2019 06 08,"Organisms must maintain proper regulation including defense and healing. Life-threatening problems may be caused by pathogens or by a multicellular organism's own cells through cancer or autoimmune disorders. Life evolved solutions to these problems that can be conceptualized through the lens of information security, which is a well-developed field in computer science. Here I argue that taking an information security view of cells is not merely semantics, but useful to explain features of signaling, regulation, and defense. An information security perspective also offers a conduit for cross-fertilization of advanced ideas from computer science and the potential for biology to inform computer science. First, I consider whether cells use passwords, i.e., initiation sequences that are required for subsequent signals to have effects, by analyzing the concept of pioneer transcription factors in chromatin regulation and cellular reprogramming. Second, I consider whether cells may encrypt signal transduction cascades. Encryption could benefit cells by making it more difficult for pathogens or oncogenes to hijack cell networks. By using numerous molecules, cells may gain a security advantage in particular against viruses, whose genome sizes are typically under selection pressure. I provide a simple conceptual argument for how cells may perform encryption through posttranslational modifications, complex formation, and chromatin accessibility. I invoke information theory to provide a criterion of an entropy spike to assess whether a signaling cascade has encryption-like features. I discuss how the frequently invoked concept of context dependency may oversimplify more advanced features of cell signaling networks, such as encryption. Therefore, by considering that biochemical networks may be even more complex than commonly realized we may be better able to understand defenses against pathogens and pathologies.",Body areas satisfaction and body mass in adolescents: mediating effects of actual-ideal body weight discrepancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175619,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2019 06 08,"This study aims at investigating prospective associations between body areas satisfaction (BAS), actual (objectively measured)-ideal body weight discrepancy, actual (self-reported)-ideal body weight discrepancy and BMI among adolescents from the general population.",Dietary intake and risk of depression among male and female with HIV/AIDS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175618,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2019 06 08,Depression is the most common mental disorder among subjects with HIV.

TSH-omas are very infrequent, accounting for less than 1% of all pituitary adenomas, thus representing a very rare cause of hyperthyroidism. For this reason, data collected on these rare disorders are relatively few, but some new researches shed new light on the etiopathogenesis, the diagnosis and the treatment of such a remarkable disease. Since the same biochemical picture is present in the syndromes of thyroid hormone resistance (RTH), in particular in the form of pituitary RTH, failure in distinguishing these clinical entities may lead to improper patient management. Conversely, early diagnosis and correct treatment of TSH-omas may prevent the occurrence of neurological and endocrinological complications, thus leading to a better rate of cure. In the present short review article, the most relevant recent advances in the pathophysiology of TSH-omas are described.",Decomposing the effects of context valence and feedback information on speed and accuracy during reinforcement learning: a meta-analytical approach using diffusion decision modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175616,"Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",2019 06 08,"Reinforcement learning (RL) models describe how humans and animals learn by trial-and-error to select actions that maximize rewards and minimize punishments. Traditional RL models focus exclusively on choices, thereby ignoring the interactions between choice preference and response time (RT), or how these interactions are influenced by contextual factors. However, in the field of perceptual decision-making, such interactions have proven to be important to dissociate between different underlying cognitive processes. Here, we investigated such interactions to shed new light on overlooked differences between learning to seek rewards and learning to avoid losses. We leveraged behavioral data from four RL experiments, which feature manipulations of two factors: outcome valence (gains vs. losses) and feedback information (partial vs. complete feedback). A Bayesian meta-analysis revealed that these contextual factors differently affect RTs and accuracy: While valence only affects RTs, feedback information affects both RTs and accuracy. To dissociate between the latent cognitive processes, we jointly fitted choices and RTs across all experiments with a Bayesian, hierarchical diffusion decision model (DDM). We found that the feedback manipulation affected drift rate, threshold, and non-decision time, suggesting that it was not a mere difficulty effect. Moreover, valence affected non-decision time and threshold, suggesting a motor inhibition in punishing contexts. To better understand the learning dynamics, we finally fitted a combination of RL and DDM (RLDDM). We found that while the threshold was modulated by trial-specific decision conflict, the non-decision time was modulated by the learned context valence. Overall, our results illustrate the benefits of jointly modeling RTs and choice data during RL, to reveal subtle mechanistic differences underlying decisions in different learning contexts."

MS vs HC CBF and CVR differences were assessed in GM regions of interest (i.e. resting state networks and vascular territories), and within WM. Correlations between CBF/CVR and age were then computed for MS and HC groups. Whereas no significant CBF and CVR differences were observed between MS and HC in any of the considered brain areas, significantly lower CBF was found in WM lesions with respect to NAWM (p < 0.001) in MS patients. Furthermore, CVR was significantly correlated with age in HC, but not in MS patients.

The biodiesel samples were prepared in one and/or two reaction steps, according to the acid index of each raw material, by esterification using H2SO4 and/or chemical transesterification using sodium ethoxide, both, through ethanolic route. The quality of the produced biodiesels was confirmed by ASTM/EN specifications. Then, biodiesel/diesel blends were prepared according to the following proportions: 10% (B10), 15% (B15), 25% (B25), and 50% (B50). In general way, all raw materials under combustion at low and high engine speed contributed to the formation of NOx and this effect was more drastically increased as the biodiesel concentration in the blends increases. N2O presented a similar behavior except for blends containing crambe and macaw biodiesel whose emissions were slightly reduced as a function of biodiesel content in these blends. Then, Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to discriminate the effect of engine operating conditions, biodiesel kind, and biodiesel content in the blends during their combustion on the exhaust emissions. The attained results point to crambe and macaw as more environmentally sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel production because they generate less greenhouse gas emissions. These results are particularly attractive considering that, both, crambe and macaw are non-edible feedstocks with great potential for biodiesel production.","Growth, accumulation and uptake of Eichhornia crassipes exposed to high cadmium concentrations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175573,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 08,"A greenhouse experiment was performed to evaluate the growth, accumulation, and uptake rate of Eichhornia crassipes subject to high cadmium concentrations. Three doses of Cd were added to polluted river water (1, 5, and 10 mg Cd/L), and polluted water with basal Cd concentration (0.070 mg/L) was used as a control. The experiment lasted for 7 days. Signs of stress and toxicity were visible in all treatments from day 3 of the experiment. The growth of the water hyacinth was slightly stimulated in the presence of low Cd concentration (1 mg/L), but this could also be due to the chloride and other nutrients present in the polluted water. Cd was accumulated mainly in roots, showing a maximum concentration of 1742.1 mg Cd/kg dw (10 mg Cd/L). The translocation from roots to leaves was low, with a maximum accumulation of 147.4 mg Cd/kg dw (10 mg Cd/L). The uptake rate for roots reached a maximum of 248.7 mg Cd/kg·day while the uptake rate for leaves did not saturate in the range of the studied concentrations (max. 20.8 mg Cd/kg·day). The water hyacinth showed promising results for the application in the treatment of Cd-polluted waters given its ability to tolerate high Cd concentrations in the media (up to 10 mg Cd/L) and its capacity for uptake and accumulation.",Renewable and non-renewable energy use and its relationship with economic growth in Myanmar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175572,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 08,"This study aims to investigate the dynamic relationship between renewable and non-renewable energies, CO2 intensity and economic growth for the period of 1990-2016 using a case study of Myanmar.

The analysis shows that total energy use plays an insignificant role in promoting economic growth. However, decomposition analysis reveals that only renewable energy use significantly promotes, whereas non-renewable energy negatively influences, economic growth. Furthermore, non-renewable energy use is counterproductive in the presence of technological inefficiency, and the size of the overall labour force fosters economic growth. Overall results are robust under different estimation scenarios, including structural break, endogeneity and mixed order of integration. This study presents a new avenue of knowledge by investigating the role of decomposed energy use and technological efficiency in promoting economic growth in the context of Myanmar.

Samples were collected in different seasons for 1 year. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was used to perform the measurement of 16 priority PAHs. Average PAH concentrations were ranged from 0.71 to 2.99 ng/m3 in air and 1.59-22.7 ng/g in soil respectively. High levels of PAHs were found in soil compared to air, which indicated deposition in soil. This could be because of the fallout of high-molecular-weight compounds. During the monsoons, PAH concentrations in the air were the lowest compared to the other seasons because of the dilution effect. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrenes were dominant in the air, contributing up to 32.5%, 22.7%, and 19.2% of total PAHs, respectively. On the other hand, soils contained fluoranthene (12.3%), pyrene (10.7%), benzo[b]fluoranthene (10%), chrysene (9.82%), and indeno[123-c,d]pyrene (9.64%) compounds. The occurrence of indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (9.14 ng/g) indicated that the soil is contaminated from fly ash and diesel emissions from the thermal power plant and vehicular emission. The diagnostic ratios, thematic maps, and principal component analysis revealed that the fly ash, diesel emissions from the thermal power plant, vehicles, and biomass burning were the probable sources of PAHs in the study area.

When and how surgical reinforcement of the lower esophageal sphincter should be performed to prevent acid reflux is still controversial. Here, we describe laparoscopic ligamentum teres cardiopexy, a surgical technique that reinforces the lower esophageal sphincter and restores its competence with a new valve, in patients with the previous conversion of gastric bypass to sleeve gastrectomy and hiatal hernia repair. We present the surgical technique performed on a patient with initial gastric bypass who underwent sleeve gastrectomy for hypoglycemia and hiatoplasty for severe GERD. Persistent GERD requested to undergo ligamentum teres cardiopexy. Ligamentum teres cardiopexy combined with the closure of the gastric crus is a late alternative treatment for GERD in patients with previous sleeve gastrectomy and hiatal hernia.",Contrasting Effects of Gambling Consumption and Gambling Problems on Subjective Wellbeing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175554,Journal of gambling studies,2019 06 08,"Most research on gambling focuses on the negative consequences associated with excessive consumption, which implicitly leads to a reduction in health and wellbeing. However, few studies have measured subjective wellbeing with respect to gambling involvement, and almost none has attempted to distinguish the separate effects of consumption and problems. We used the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) in two surveys with different recruitment criteria. Study 1 (N = 1524, 50.6% female) was designed to compare differences in personal wellbeing among gamblers, and Study 2 (N = 1586, 70.2% female) compared wellbeing between gamblers and non-gamblers. Participants provided demographic information, and answered questions allowing them to be grouped into high/low levels of consumption, and problem gambling risk categories. After accounting for gambling problems, higher consumption was associated with higher wellbeing. Study 2 showed consistent results; revealing that both high and low consumption non-problem gamblers (NPGs) had higher personal wellbeing than non-gamblers. Nevertheless, the deleterious effect of gambling problems on wellbeing was larger than the effect of consumption. After accounting for population prevalence (i.e., per capita), only 15.3% of the negative influence of gambling problems on PWI was attributable to problem gamblers; the remainder associated with lower risk categories. Although results were consistent when controlling for demographic covariates, the positive link between consumption and wellbeing may be due to unmeasured variables such as personality traits, health, and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, the assessment of subjective wellbeing provides a unique perspective on both the positive and negative effects of gambling.",Prevalence and Characteristics of Sports Betting in a Population of Young Students in Madrid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175553,Journal of gambling studies,2019 06 08,"The participation of young people in sports betting is causing social alarm as a result of both its invasive advertising and its possible involvement in the development of gaming problems. The objective of this study is to identify and characterise the situation in which young students in Madrid participate in sports betting. A Sports Betting Evaluation Questionnaire was given to a convenience sample of 735 young students from Madrid (aged 18-25), both live (face-to-face) and on-line. 42.6% of the sample admitted having placed sports bets at one time; 81% of those who had bet were men and 78% had bet live, versus 18% who had done so on-line and 5% using both systems. Men were found to bet more frequently and spend more money and more time doing so than women. Those who bet on-line do so more frequently and spend more money and more time than those who bet live. Young people bet mainly on football and the most frequent bets are the most obvious ones, i.e. on the winner. The frequency of participation in sports betting is high, but the time and money spent is moderate, albeit always higher in men than in women.",The role of TNF-α in chordoma progression and inflammatory pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175552,Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),2019 06 08,"Chordomas are highly therapy-resistant primary bone tumors that exhibit high relapse rates and may induce local destruction.

TrmD comprises two domains with the N-terminal domain binding to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) cofactor and the C-terminal domain critical for tRNA binding. Bacterial TrmD is functional as a dimer. Here we report the backbone NMR resonance assignments for the full length TrmD protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most resonances were assigned and the secondary structure for each amino acid was determined according to the assigned backbone resonances. The availability of the assignment will be valuable for exploring molecular interactions of TrmD with ligands, inhibitors and tRNA.","CUL1 Knockdown Attenuates the Adhesion, Invasion, and Migration of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells via Inhibition of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175550,Pathology oncology research : POR,2019 06 08,"Cullin-1 (CUL1) is an important factor for tumor growth and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer therapy, but the molecular mechanism in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is unknown. In the present study, CUL1 shRNA was transfected into BT549 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cell morphology, adhesion, invasion, and migration assays were carried out in the CUL1 knockdown cells. Additionally, protein expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors, Akt phosphorylation at S473 (pAkt), glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation at ser9 (pGSK3β), cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin, and epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation at Tyr1068 (pEGFR) were detected by Western blot analysis. CUL1 knockdown significantly suppressed the adhesion, invasion and migration capabilities of the cells, and decreased the expression of Snail1/2, ZEB1/2, Twist1/2, Vimentin, and increased the expression of Cytokeratin 18 (CK18). Moreover, CUL1 knockdown significantly downregulated the phosphorylated levels of Akt, GSK3β, and EGFR, inhibiting the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The results indicate that CUL1 knockdown prohibited the metastasis behaviors of breast cancer cells through downregulation (dephosphorylation) of the EMT signaling pathways of EGFR and Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin in breast cancer. These results strongly suggested that reinforcement of the EMT might be a key for CUL1 to accelerate TNBC metastasis.",Prospects for Declarative Mathematical Modeling of Complex Biological Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175549,Bulletin of mathematical biology,2019 06 08,"Declarative modeling uses symbolic expressions to represent models. With such expressions, one can formalize high-level mathematical computations on models that would be difficult or impossible to perform directly on a lower-level simulation program, in a general-purpose programming language. Examples of such computations on models include model analysis, relatively general-purpose model reduction maps, and the initial phases of model implementation, all of which should preserve or approximate the mathematical semantics of a complex biological model. The potential advantages are particularly relevant in the case of developmental modeling, wherein complex spatial structures exhibit dynamics at molecular, cellular, and organogenic levels to relate genotype to multicellular phenotype. Multiscale modeling can benefit from both the expressive power of declarative modeling languages and the application of model reduction methods to link models across scale. Based on previous work, here we define declarative modeling of complex biological systems by defining the operator algebra semantics of an increasingly powerful series of declarative modeling languages including reaction-like dynamics of parameterized and extended objects; we define semantics-preserving implementation and semantics-approximating model reduction transformations; and we outline a ""meta-hierarchy"" for organizing declarative models and the mathematical methods that can fruitfully manipulate them.",A Novel Unification Method to Characterize a Broad Class of Growth Curve Models Using Relative Growth Rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175548,Bulletin of mathematical biology,2019 06 08,"Growth curve models serve as the mathematical framework for the quantitative studies of growth in many areas of applied science. The evolution of novel growth curves can be categorized in two notable directions, namely generalization and unification. In case of generalization, a modeler starts with a simple mathematical form to describe the behavior of the data and increases the complexity of the equation by incorporating more parameters to obtain a more flexible shape. The unification refers to the process of obtaining a compact representation of a large number of growth equations. An enormous number of growth equations are made available in the literature by means of the generalization of existing growth laws. However, the unification of growth equations has received relatively less attention from the researchers. Two significant unification functions are available in the literature, namely the Box-Cox transformation by Garcia (For Biometry Model Inf Sci 1:63-68, 2005) and generalized logarithmic and exponential functions by Martinez et al. (Phys A 387:5679-5687, 2008; Phys A 388:2922-2930, 2009). Existing unification approaches are found to have limited applications if the growth equation is characterized by the relative growth rate (RGR). RGR has immense practical value in biological growth curve analysis, which has been amplified by the construction of size and time covariate models, in which; RGR is represented either as a function of size or time or both. The present study offers a unification function for the RGR growth curves. The proposed function combines a broad class of the growth curves and possesses a greater generality than the existing unification functions. We also propose the notion of generalized RGR, which is capable of making interrelations among the unifying functions. Our proposed method is expected to enhance the generality of software and may aid in choosing an optimal model from a set of competitor growth equations.",Utilization of blue panic (Panicum antidotale) as an alternative feed resource for feeding Barky sheep in arid regions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175547,Tropical animal health and production,2019 06 08,"This study aimed at elucidating effects of replacing sorghum with blue panic (BP) on total dry matter intake (TDMI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), apparent nutrient digestibility, blood biochemical constituents, rumen fermentation patterns and economic feasibility of Barky male lambs. Fifteen lambs (av. BW, 22.5 ± 1.6 kg) were randomly allotted into 3 treatments (n = 5/group). Control lambs were given a diet of concentrate mixture (CM) plus sorghum (S), BP50% lambs were given a diet of CM plus (S: PB 1:1) and BP100% lambs were given CM plus PB. The experiment lasted for 54 days. At the last week of the experiment, the apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients were determined using lignin contents of feeds and faeces as an internal marker. Blood samples were collected at weeks 3, 5 and 7 to determine serum biochemical parameters. Results showed that TDMI significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by diet, whereas ADG was not affected. Mean FCR values were 5.67, 5.46 and 5.86 for control, BP50% and BP100%, respectively. Neither nutrients digestibility nor ruminal fermentation parameters were affected (P > 0.05) by total replacement of sorghum with BP. Likewise, none of the serum biochemical constituents were different in BP than in control lambs. This study concluded that BP grass would be considered as one of the promising tropical green forages in the arid regions as an alternative feedstuff in case of shortage of green fodders.",Beta-Glucan as Wall Material in Encapsulation of Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) Extract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175546,"Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",2019 06 08,"The aim of the study was to investigate the potential of using β-glucan as wall material to microencapsulate the elderberry extract. Firstly, the extract was obtained by the water-acetone extraction method to extract mainly anthocyanins from ground dried fruits. The extract was mixed with wall materials: maltodextrin-β-glucan mixture and the control sample as a widely used combination of maltodextrin and arabic gum (92.5:7.5). In the examined samples the content of β-glucan was 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%. Properties of encapsulated extracts of final powders were measured using particle size and morphology, encapsulation efficiency, color measurement, total anthocyanin and ascorbic acid content (TAC and TAAC) methods. Our results indicated that the β-glucan wall material samples had higher process quality compared to control samples. Addition of β-glucan insignificantly decreases encapsulation efficiency. Among powders with β-glucan content, the powder with 1% β-glucan content was characterized by the smallest (24 μm) particle size. The sample with 2% β-glucan content had the highest water solubility and polydispersity index. Due to the encapsulation efficiency, moisture content, and water solubility index, the optimum condition of microencapsulation process for elderberry extract was for samples with 0.5% β-glucan as wall material content. To conclude, due to high molecular weight of β-glucan the higher than 0.5% ratio of β-glucan is not recommended for spray-drying method. However, small quantity of health-beneficial β-glucan could act as potential encapsulation agent in clean label products to replace Arabic gum."

Nevertheless, microsomal GSTs (MGSTs), a unique subclass of the GST superfamily associated with membranes, are rarely studied in insects. Here, we isolated an MGST gene in Apis cerana cerana (AccMGST1) and verified its role in oxidative stress response. We found higher expression of AccMGST1 in protective or defensive tissue, that is, the epidermis, which indicated its role in stress resistance. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that AccMGST1 was upregulated by oxidative stresses at the transcriptional level. In contrast, AccMGST1 expression was inhibited when the antioxidant vitamin C (VC) was fed to experimental bees. Through western blotting, we found that the protein level of AccMGST1 under oxidative stress corresponded to the transcript level. Disc diffusion and mixed-function oxidation (MFO) assays suggested that AccMGST1 can protect not only cells but also DNA against oxidative damage. Furthermore, we discovered that the expression patterns of known antioxidant genes were changed in A. cerana cerana after AccMGST1 was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi). Thus, we concluded that the gene AccMGST1 exerts a significant role in the antioxidant mechanism.",Imaging assessment and accuracy in coronary artery autopsy: comparison of frequency-domain optical coherence tomography with intravascular ultrasound and histology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175528,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2019 06 08,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a coronary artery imaging technique with high resolution. Second-generation frequency-domain OCT (FD-OCT) technology allows safer and faster clinical application compared with first-generation time-domain OCT (TD-OCT). Only limited validation studies compare FD-OCT with other modes of analysis: histology, which is the current gold standard, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). This study therefore aims to demonstrate the accuracy of FD-OCT images compared with IVUS and histology. FD-OCT and IVUS images were acquired from 203 segments from 31 coronary arteries obtained at autopsy from 20 cadavers. Of these, 30 randomly-selected pairs were used to create three classifications of plaque type based on morphological features in FD-OCT and IVUS compared with corresponding histopathology. The remaining 173 pairs were used to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy for classification of coronary plaques by FD-OCT. Plaque type distributions were 27% fibroatheroma, 22% fibrocalcific plaque and 51% fibrous plaque. The diagnostic accuracies of FD-OCT for fibroatheroma, fibrocalcific plaque and fibrous plaque were 90, 95 and 93%, respectively. Those of IVUS were 81, 89 and 84%, respectively. FD-OCT achieved high diagnostic accuracy for the classification of coronary plaques comparable to TD-OCT. Physicians should consider the differences in the ability to classify plaque morphology of OCT of imaging devices when applying their use.",Optical coherence tomography evaluation of the absorb bioresorbable scaffold performance for overlap versus non-overlap segments in patients with coronary chronic total occlusion: insight from the GHOST-CTO registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175527,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2019 06 08,"The Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) promised to avoid some of the disadvantages of its metal predecessors. Even though it has been taken off the market, limited data is available about its use in coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) and its performance in overlap segments, which would be of special research interest due to its large thickness. This data is still pertinent since the platform of bioresorbable devices has not been abandoned, with several companies working on it. We aimed to compare healing and performance between overlap (OL) and non-overlap regions (NOL) of CTO lesions treated with BVS, using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Fourteen patients with overlapping BVS were included from the GHOST-CTO registry, resulting in 25 OL and 38 NOL regions. OCT based parameters were compared between OL and NOL groups at baseline (post-implantation) and 12-month follow-up. The mean age was 61.7 ± 7.2 years and 12 (86%) were males. Twelve (86%) patients underwent PCI for stable coronary artery disease and 2 (14%) had unstable angina. At 12-month follow-up, mean lumen area decreased in both NOL and OL regions, but the decrease was significantly larger in the OL region (NOL - 0.7 ± 1.33 vs. OL - 2.4 ± 1.54 mm2; p = 0.002). Mean scaffold area increased in both regions, but increased significantly more in NOL ( + 1.1 ± 1.54 vs. + 0.4 ± 1.16 mm2; p = 0.016). The percent of uncovered struts was lower in the OL group (5.0 ± 6.6% vs. 3.75 ± 8.7%, p = 0.043), whereas the percentage of malapposed struts was similar (0.3 ± 0.5% vs. 0.7 ± 2.3%, p = 0.441). Neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) was more pronounced in the OL region (0.13 ± 0.04 vs. 0.24 ± 0.10 mm2, p = 0.001). The OL and NOL segments showed comparable healing in terms of coverage and malapposition. However, NIH was more prominent in OL region.

They may present in early infancy or more insidiously in adulthood, often in association with congenital heart disease such as tetralogy of Fallot or other syndromes. In recent years, cross-sectional imaging, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has become widely utilized for the noninvasive assessment of congenital PA diseases, supplementing echocardiography and at times supplanting invasive angiography. In this article, modern CT and MRI techniques for imaging congenital PA disorders are summarized. The key clinical features, cross-sectional imaging findings, and treatment options for the most commonly encountered entities are then reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the ever-growing role of cross-sectional imaging options in facilitating early and accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment.",Influence of microorganism and plant oils on the structure of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) biosurfactants revealed by a novel thin layer chromatography mass spectrometry method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175524,Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,2019 06 08,"Mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL) are microbial glycolipid biosurfactants with great potential for application in cosmetics and household detergents. In current biotechnological processes, they are produced by basidiomycetous fungi, the Ustilaginaceae, as a complex mixture of different chemical structures. It was the aim of this paper to study the influence of producer organisms and substrates on the resulting MEL structures with a novel high-resolution HPTLC-MALDI-TOF method. Given the seven different microbes and four plant oils, our analysis revealed that the product concentrations varied strongly between organisms, while they were similar for the different substrates. Coconut oil presented an exception, since only one organism was able to synthesize MEL from this substrate in considerable yields. Analysis by GC-FID further showed that the chain length pattern of hydrophobic fatty acid side-chains was very specific for individual organisms, while substrates had only a minor influence on the chain length. Our novel HPTLC-MALDI-TOF combination method finally demonstrated the presence of multiple MEL sub-variants with differing acetylation and fatty acid chain lengths. It also revealed the production of a more hydrophilic biosurfactant mannosylmannitol lipid (MML) as a side-product in certain fungi. Overall, it was concluded that the pattern of produced biosurfactant structures are mainly governed by producer organisms rather than substrates.",Impact of mammalian cell culture conditions on monoclonal antibody charge heterogeneity: an accessory monitoring tool for process development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175523,Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,2019 06 08,"Recombinant monoclonal antibodies are predominantly produced in mammalian cell culture bioprocesses. Post-translational modifications affect the micro-heterogeneity of the product and thereby influence important quality attributes, such as stability, solubility, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The analysis of the surface charge distribution of monoclonal antibodies provides aggregated information about these modifications. In this work, we established a direct injection pH gradient cation exchange chromatography method, which determines charge heterogeneity from cell culture supernatant without any purification steps. This tool was further applied to monitor processes that were performed under certain process conditions. Concretely, we were able to provide insights into charge variant formation during a fed-batch process of a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture, in turn producing a monoclonal antibody under varying temperatures and glucose feed strategies. Glucose concentration impacted the total emergence of acidic variants, whereas the variation of basic species was mainly dependent on process temperature. The formation rates of acidic species were described with a second-order reaction, where a temperature increase favored the conversion. This platform method will aid as a sophisticated optimization tool for mammalian cell culture processes. It provides a quality fingerprint for the produced mAb, which can be tested, compared to the desired target and confirmed early in the process chain.",The Role of Aerobic Training Variables Progression on Glycemic Control of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: a Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175522,Sports medicine - open,2019 06 08,"Aerobic training (AT) improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The clinical presentation of EoE in childhood may include failure to thrive and feeding intolerance. The complication of food impaction is often related to the presence of strictures or narrow caliber esophagus. Over the last decade, there has been tremendous progress in the field of eosinophilic disorders, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis. Conventional treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis involves topical swallowed steroids, systemic steroids, elimination diets, and/or esophageal dilation. However, treatment outcomes with the above modalities are not satisfactory for all patients with EoE and alternative treatments are clearly needed. There has been ongoing research targeting the treatment-refractory population of patients with EoE and the population with long-term consequences of the disease and its treatment. With the significant eosinophilic infiltration that characterizes EoE, anti-IL-5 therapies designed to target eosinophilic inflammation have been some of the most studied anti-inflammatory biologic therapies in EoE. In the studies published to date, while various IL-5 inhibitors have decreased the numbers of esophageal eosinophils, they have not depleted them to the levels consistent with histologic remission of EoE. As additional biologics that modulate Th2-mediated immunity are trialed for the treatment of EoE, we stand to learn more about the inflammatory factors mediating this challenging condition. In this review, we discuss the alternative modes of therapy in EoE that have emerged, with a focus on anti-IL-5 therapies and other biologics, their variation of success, and ultimately, the future of treatment in this field.",Utilization of Advance Care Planning for Homeless Adults: Case Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175520,Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2019 06 08,"Given the barriers to advance care planning (ACP) and low utilization of outpatient advance directives in hospital settings, it is unclear if ACP in primary care for adults who have experienced homelessness is effective and a valuable use of clinical time. As part of our ACP Project, we examined the feasibility and outcomes of ACP in primary care for patients who have experienced homelessness. We found that such efforts had significant impacts on patients' hospital care and allowed their wishes to be honored when they lost capacity for medical decision-making, particularly at the end of life. Here, we present six case studies demonstrating the outcomes of ACP in primary care for homeless adults and highlight lessons learned. To our knowledge, this is the first case series showing how ACP for homeless adults in primary care has been utilized during hospital care.

In mechanically-skinned fibres, the sarcolemma is removed but normal excitation-contraction coupling remains functional. Force responses in mechanically-skinned fibres were examined with and without osmotic compression by polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 kDa (PVP-40) or Dextran 500 kDa (dextran). Fibre diameter increased to 116 ± 2% (mean ± SEM) when rat skinned type II fibres were immersed in the standard intracellular solution, but remained close to the in situ size when 3% (mass/volume) PVP-40 or 4% Dextran were present. Myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, as indicated by pCa50 (- log10[Ca2+] at half-maximal force), was increased in 4% Dextran (0.072 ± 0.007 pCa50 shift), but was not significantly changed in 3% PVP-40. Maximum Ca2+-activated force increased slightly to 103 ± 1% and 104 ± 1% in PVP-40 and Dextran, respectively. Both tetanic and depolarization-induced force responses in rat skinned type II fibres, elicited by electrical stimulation and ion substitution respectively, were increased by ~ 10 to 15% when the fibres were returned to their normal in situ diameter by addition of PVP-40 or Dextran. Interestingly, the potentiation of these force responses in PVP-40 was appreciably greater than could be explained by potentiation of myofibrillar function alone. These results indicate that muscle fibre swelling, as can occur with intense exercise, decreases evoked force responses by reducing both the Ca2+-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus properties and Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum."

Eleven articles were included in the review. Prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with a slightly increased risk of ASD in two cohort studies on overlapping populations and in one case-control study; in three other case-control studies, no significant association was found. One cohort study found a slightly reduced risk of ASD after postnatal antibiotic exposure, while two other cohort studies on overlapping populations and three case-control studies reported an increased risk. Meta-analysis of the eligible studies showed no significant associations.

Ninety-one percent of children/adolescents and thirty-one percent of young adults were diagnosed with one or more co-occurring diagnoses using the MINI. MINI diagnostic rates were comparable to those found in the literature on children/adolescents with ASD; however, in young adults, MINI diagnostic rates were lower relative to rates found in the literature on young adults with ASD.

Analogous to an electrical resistor-capacitor circuit, it is expressed as the product of arterial compliance (Ca) and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR). Hypocapnia increases the time constant in healthy volunteers and decreases arterial compliance in head trauma. How the combination of hyocapnia and trauma affects this parameter has yet to be studied. We hypothesized that in TBI patients the intense vasoconstrictive action of hypocapnia would dominate over the decrease in compliance seen after hyperventilation. The predominant vasoconstrictive response would maintain an incoming blood volume in the arterial circulation, thereby lengthening tau. We retrospectively analyzed recordings of intracranial pressure (ICP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and blood flow velocity (FV) obtained from a cohort of 27 severe TBI patients [(39/30 years (median/IQR), 5 women; admission GCS 6/5 (median/IQR)] studied during a standard clinical CO2 reactivity test. The reactivity test was performed by means of a 50-min increase in ventilation (20% increase in respiratory minute volume). CVR and Ca were estimated from these recordings, and their product calculated to find the time constant. CVR significantly increased [median CVR pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 1.05/1.35 mmHg/(cm3/s)]. Ca decreased (median Ca pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 0.130/0.124 arbitrary units) to statistical significance (p = 0.005). The product of these two parameters resulted in a significant prolongation of the time constant (median tau pre-hypocapnia/during hypocapnia: 0.136 s/0.152 s, p ˂ .001). Overall, the increase in CVR dominated over the decrease in compliance, hence tau was longer. We demonstrate a significant increase in the time constant of the cerebral circulation during hypocapnia after severe TBI, and attribute this to an increase in cerebrovascular resistance which outweighs the decrease in cerebral arterial bed compliance.",Accuracy and precision of non-invasive cardiac output monitoring by electrical cardiometry: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175501,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 06 08,"Cardiac output monitoring is used in critically ill and high-risk surgical patients. Intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution and transpulmonary thermodilution, considered the gold standard, are invasive and linked to complications. Therefore, many non-invasive cardiac output devices have been developed and studied. One of those is electrical cardiometry. The results of validation studies are conflicting, which emphasize the need for definitive validation of accuracy and precision. We performed a database search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library of Clinical Trials to identify studies comparing cardiac output measurement by electrical cardiometry and a reference method. Pooled bias, limits of agreement (LoA) and mean percentage error (MPE) were calculated using a random-effects model. A pooled MPE of less than 30% was considered clinically acceptable. A total of 13 studies in adults (620 patients) and 11 studies in pediatrics (603 patients) were included. For adults, pooled bias was 0.03 L min-1 [95% CI - 0.23; 0.29], LoA - 2.78 to 2.84 L min-1 and MPE 48.0%. For pediatrics, pooled bias was - 0.02 L min-1 [95% CI - 0.09; 0.05], LoA - 1.22 to 1.18 L min-1 and MPE 42.0%. Inter-study heterogeneity was high for both adults (I2 = 93%, p < 0.0001) and pediatrics (I2 = 86%, p < 0.0001). Despite the low bias for both adults and pediatrics, the MPE was not clinically acceptable. Electrical cardiometry cannot replace thermodilution and transthoracic echocardiography for the measurement of absolute cardiac output values.

The purpose of this trial was to determine the frequency and duration of capnography-detected respiratory adverse events in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). In this prospective observational trial, 250 consenting patients undergoing elective surgery with general anesthesia were monitored by standard monitoring together with blinded capnography and pulse oximetry monitoring. The capnography notification settings were adjusted to match nursing (Level II) and physician (Level I) alarm thresholds. 163 (95%) patients had a Level II notification and 135 (78%) had a Level I notification during standard monitoring. The most common events detected by the capnography monitor included hypocapnia, apnea, tachypnea, bradypnea and hypoxemia, with silent notification duration for these events ranging from 17 ± 13 to 189 ± 127 s. During standard monitoring, 15 respiratory adverse events were reported, with 8 events occurring when valid blinded/silenced capnography and pulse oximetry data was collected simultaneously. Capnography and the Integrated Pulmonary Index™ algorithm (IPI) detected respiratory adverse events earlier than standard monitoring in 75% and 88% of cases, respectively, with an average early warning time of 8 ± 11 min. Three patients' blinded capnography was unblinded to facilitate clinical care. Respiratory adverse events are frequent in the PACU, and the addition of capnography and IPI to current standard monitoring provides potentially clinically relevant information on respiratory status, including early warning of some respiratory adverse events.Trial registration ClinialTrials.gov Identifier NCT02707003 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02707003 ).",Clinical features of pseudocirrhosis in metastatic breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175499,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 06 08,"Pseudocirrhosis has been demonstrated to mimic cirrhosis radiographically, but studies evaluating the pathophysiology and clinical features are lacking.

Here, we used natural variation in pepper (Capsicum spp.) resistance combined with an untargeted metabolomics approach to detect secondary metabolites related to thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) resistance. Using leaf disc choice assays, we tested 11 Capsicum accessions of C. annuum and C. chinense in both vegetative and flowering stages for thrips resistance. Metabolites in the leaves of these 11 accessions were analyzed using LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics. The choice assays showed significant differences among the accessions in thrips feeding damage. The level of resistance depended on plant developmental stage. Metabolomics analyses showed differences in metabolomes among the Capsicum species and plant developmental stages. Moreover, metabolomic profiles of resistant and susceptible accessions differed. Monomer and dimer acyclic diterpene glycosides (capsianosides) were pinpointed as metabolites that were related to thrips resistance. Sucrose and malonylated flavone glycosides were related to susceptibility. To our knowledge, this is the first time that dimer capsianosides of pepper have been linked to insect resistance.

The impact of pollen allergies is on the rise due to increased pollen levels caused by global warming and the spread of highly invasive weeds. The production, release, and dispersal of pollen depend on the ambient weather conditions. The temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover, and wind are known to affect the amount of pollen in the atmosphere. In the past, various regression techniques have been applied to estimate and forecast the daily pollen concentration in the atmosphere based on the weather conditions. In this research, machine learning methods were applied to the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) data to estimate the daily Ambrosia pollen over a 300 km × 300 km region centered on a NEXRAD weather radar. The Neural Network and Random Forest machine learning methods have been employed to develop separate models to estimate Ambrosia pollen over the region. A feasible way of estimating the daily pollen concentration using only the NEXRAD radar data and machine learning methods would lay the foundation to forecast daily pollen at a fine spatial resolution nationally.","Health economic evaluation of a web-based intervention for depression: the EVIDENT-trial, a randomized controlled study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175475,Health economics review,2019 06 08,"Depression often remains undiagnosed or treated inadequately.

However, this correspondence is not necessarily chemically relevant for symmetric molecules and can lead to an artificial inflation of ligand pose distance metrics, particularly those that depend on receptor superposition (rather than ligand superposition), such as docking root mean square deviation (RMSD). Several of the commonly-used RMSD calculation algorithms that correct for molecular symmetry do not take into account the bonding structure of molecules and can therefore result in non-physical atomic mapping. Here, we present DockRMSD, a docking pose distance calculator that converts the symmetry correction to a graph isomorphism searching problem, in which the optimal atomic mapping and RMSD calculation are performed by an exhaustive and fast matching search of all isomorphisms of the ligand structure graph. We show through evaluation of docking poses generated by AutoDock Vina on the CSAR Hi-Q set that DockRMSD is capable of deterministically identifying the minimum symmetry-corrected RMSD and is able to do so without significant loss of computational efficiency compared to other methods. The open-source DockRMSD program can be conveniently integrated with various docking pipelines to assist with accurate atomic mapping and RMSD calculations, which can therefore help improve docking performance, especially for ligand molecules with complicated structural symmetry.",Clinical benefit of wideband-tympanometry: a pediatric audiology clinical study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175454,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2019 06 08,"Wideband-tympanometry (WBT) could give more informative data about the tympanic condition than the conventional tympanometry.

Data have been collected within the study ""Clinical decision making and outcome in routine care for people with severe mental illness"" (CEDAR), which is a naturalistic, longitudinal, observational study carried out in six European countries. Patients with a severe mental illness attending outpatient units and their treating clinicians have been recruited. Clinicians' Clinical Decision Making (CDM) styles have been explored through the Clinical Decision Making Style Scale. Patients' clinical and social outcomes have been assessed through validated assessment instruments. The sample consisted of 588 patients and 213 professionals. Professionals were mainly psychiatrists (35.7%), nurses (21.6%), support workers, social workers or occupational therapists (24.9%), psychologists (9.9%) or trainees in psychiatry (4.7%). In the majority of cases, clinicians adopted a shared CDM style. Shared CDM was more frequently adopted with patients with psychotic disorders, with a better quality of life and social functioning. At multivariate analyses, the likelihood of adopting shared decision making increased in patients with higher levels of interpersonal relationships' skills (p < 0.05) and global functioning (p < 0.01). On the contrary, being a trainee in psychiatry reduced the likelihood of adopting shared CDM (p < 0.008). Shared decision making has been adopted mainly when patients have a better functioning and less severe clinical symptomatology and by less trained clinicians, differently from national and international recommendations. More efforts should be made to implement interventions to promote shared CDM, with a specific focus for trainees in psychiatry.",Regulations of organism by materials: a new understanding of biological inorganic chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175447,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,2019 06 08,"Chemical biology generally highlights the modulation or control of life processes using chemical molecules. However, the rapid development of materials' science has resulted in the increasing application of various functional materials in biological regulation. More importantly, the state of art of creating the integration of materials, either the inorganic or organic matrices, with living organisms has opened a window of opportunity to add the multiplex function to organisms. In this review, we suggest a new concept of materials' biology that refers to promoting functional evolution of living organisms using material-based modification of structures, functions, and behaviors of biological organisms, which could change the modification of organisms from the current molecular-level regulation to materials' level. Thus, this review focuses on the recent achievements of material-based modification of organisms that evolves the biological function of cells, bacteria, and viruses using biomimetic strategies. The bioinspired strategies for material-based modification, including layer-by-layer, biomimetic mineralization, interfacial reactive deposition, etc., are briefly introduced. Furthermore, the interaction between materials and organisms has performed a broad function that is not retained by organisms at their native state, which results in the applications in structural support, protection, environment control, energy, vaccine improvement, and cancer treatment. The significance of material-based regulations of organism is to use rationally designed materials to endow new physiological functions to organisms, which provides another perspective to understand biological inorganic chemistry. The roles of materials in chemical regulations of biology are highlighted. New characteristics as well as functions can be achieved by integration the rationally designed materials onto/into living organisms, following material-assisted biological improvement/evolution.",Proton affinity studies of nickel N2S2 complexes and control of aggregation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175446,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,2019 06 08,"The thiolate ligands of [NiFe]-H2ase enzymes have been implicated as proton-binding sites for the reduction/oxidation of H+/H2. This study examines the ligand effect on reactivity of NiN2S2 complexes with an array of acids in methanol solution. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy is utilized to observe the transformation from the monomeric species to a trimetallic complex that is formed after proton-induced ligand dissociation. Nickel complexes with a flexible (propyl and ethyl) N to N linker were found to readily form the trimetallic complex with acids as weak as ammonium (pKa = 10.9 in methanol). A more constrained nickel complex with a diazacycloheptane N to N linker required stronger acids such as 2,2-dichloroacetic acid (pKa = 6.38 in methanol) to form the trimetallic complex and featured the formation of an NiN2S2H+ complex with acetic acid (pKa = 9.63 in methanol). The most strained ligand, which featured a diazacyclohexane backbone, readily dissociated from the nickel center upon mixture with acids with pKa ≤ 9.63 and showed no evidence of a trimetallic species with any acid. This research highlights the dramatic differences in reactivity with proton sources that can be imparted by minor alterations to ligand geometry and strain."

LAB have several attractive advantages as carriers of mucosal vaccines, and the effectiveness of LAB vaccines has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Research on LAB vaccines to date has focused on whether antigen-specific immunity, particularly antibody responses, can be induced. However, with recent developments in immunology, microbiology, and vaccinology, more detailed analyses of the underlying mechanisms, especially, of the induction of cell-mediated immunity and memory cells, have been required for vaccine development and licensure. In this mini-review, we will discuss the issues, including (i) immune responses other than antibody production, (ii) persistence of LAB vaccine immunity, (iii) comparative evaluation of LAB vaccines with any existing or reference vaccines, (iv) strategies for increasing the effectiveness of LAB vaccines, and (iv) effects of microbiota on the efficacy of LAB vaccines. Although these issues have been rarely studied or discussed to date in relation to LAB vaccine research, further understanding of them is critical for the practical application of LAB vaccine systems.",Differential effects of bioreactor process variables and purification on the human recombinant lysosomal enzyme β-glucuronidase produced from Chinese hamster ovary cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175430,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 08,"β-Glucuronidase is a lysosomal enzyme and a molecular model of a class of therapeutics approved as enzyme replacement therapies for lysosomal storage diseases. Understanding the effect of bioreactor process variables on the production and quality of the biologics is critical for maintaining quality and efficacy of the biotherapeutics. Here, we have investigated the effect of three process variables, in a head-to-head comparison using a parallel bioreactor system (n = 8), namely 0.25 mM butyrate addition, a temperature shift (from 37 to 32 °C), and a pH shift (from 7.0 to 6.7) along with a control (pH 7, temperature 37 °C, and no additive) on the production and quality of human recombinant β-glucuronidase (GUS) by a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The study was performed as two independent runs (2 bioreactors per treatment per run; n ≤ 4). Although statistically not significant, protein production slightly increased with either 0.25 mM butyrate addition (13%) or pH shift (7%), whereas temperature shift decreased production (12%, not significant). Further characterization of the purified GUS samples showed that purification selectively enriched the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-containing GUS protein. Noticeably, a variation observed for the critical quality attribute (CQA) of the enzyme, namely M6P content, decreased after purification, across treatment replicates and, more so, across different treatments. The dimer content in the purified samples was comparable (~25%), and no significant discrepancy was observed in terms of GUS charge variants by capillary electrophoresis analysis. MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis of released N-glycans from GUS showed a minor variation in glycoforms among the treatment groups. Temperature shift resulted in a slightly increased sialylated glycan content (21.6%) when compared to control (15.5%). These results suggest that bioreactor processes have a differential effect, and better control is required for achieving improved production of GUS enzyme in CHO cells without affecting drastically its CQAs. However, the purification method allowed for enrichment of GUS with similar CQA profiles, regardless of the upstream treatments, indicating for the first time that the effect of slight alterations in upstream process parameters on the CQA profile can be offset with an effective and robust purification method downstream to maintain drug substance uniformity.","The inhibitor of apoptosis protein MoBir1 is involved in the suppression of hydrogen peroxide-induced fungal cell death, reactive oxygen species generation, and pathogenicity of rice blast fungus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175429,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 08,"The inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family has been identified in a variety of organisms. All IAPs contain one to three baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains, which are required for anti-apoptotic activity. Here, we identified a type II BIR domain-containing protein, MoBir1, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Expression of the MoBIR1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suppressed hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and delayed yeast cell chronological aging. Delayed aging was found to require the carboxyl terminus of MoBir1. M. oryzae transformants overexpressing the MoBIR1 gene demonstrated increased growth rate and biomass, delayed mycelial aging, and enhanced resistance to hydrogen peroxide but reduced reactive oxygen species generation and virulence. Moreover, MoBIR1-overexpressing transformants exhibited anti-apoptotic activity. However, MoBIR1 silencing resulted in no obvious phenotypic changes, compared with the wild-type M. oryzae strain Guy11. Our findings broaden the knowledge on fungal type II BIR domain-containing proteins.",Soluble expression of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in Escherichia coli using superfolder green fluorescent protein as fusion partner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175428,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 08,"Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) has great prospect in medical therapies and diagnostic applications due to its binding affinity and low immunogenicity. However, the application of scFv is limited by its heterologous expression facing challenges of insoluble aggregation. sfGFP has been developed as fusion tag to facilitate the solubility of fusion partner in Escherichia coli. We designed fusion protein of anti-influenza PB2 scFv at C-terminus of sfGFP and successfully obtained soluble expression of sfGFP-scFv-His in Escherichia coli. The expression level of sfGFP-scFv-His reached at 20 mg/L of bacterial culture when the culture was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 18 °C for 16 h. And 6 mg scFv-His was obtained from the cleavage of 10 mg pure sfGFP-scFv-His with TEV protease. In addition, we found that sfGFP-scFv-His was more stable than scFv-His in chicken serum, suggesting that sfGFP not only facilitated the solubility of scFv in Escherichia coli, but also promoted the stability of scFv. The immunologic activity of sfGFP-scFv-His was confirmed by Western blot and ELISA; the results showed that anti-PB2 sfGFP-scFv-His exhibited specific binding to PB2. Hemagglutination and comparative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that sfGFP-scFv-His and scFv-His inhibited the replication of H1N1 influenza virus in the infected A549 cells. These results further develop the application of scFv as an agent, such as anti-influenza. Furthermore, soluble expression of scFv using sfGFP as fusion partner provide a cost-effective preparation model for manufacturing scFv against pandemic disease.",No impact of an extensive social intervention program on return to work and quality of life after acute cardiac event: a cluster-randomized trial in patients with negative occupational prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175425,International archives of occupational and environmental health,2019 06 08,To examine the effectiveness of extensive social therapy intervention during inpatient multi-component cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on return to work and quality of life in patients with low probability of work resumption after an acute cardiac event.,Postoperative functional outcomes and complications of partially intraanal canal anastomosis in stapled ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175423,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 06 14,"For ulcerative colitis (UC), stapled ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) reportedly results in better bowel function than does IPAA with mucosectomy.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is associated with increased atherosclerotic burden and adverse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study is to assess the predictive value of preprocedural serum PCT levels in comparison with established risk scores in TAVI patients. A total of 243 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI at our institution were included prospectively in the study and 230 of these patients participated in the follow-up 1 year after TAVI. The primary endpoints were mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Multivariable analysis revealed that preprocedural PCT was the only independent predictor of 30-day mortality (HR 2.84; 95% CI 1.59-5.06; p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.90; 95% CI 1.17-3.11; p = 0.01), whereas high-sensitivity C-reactive protein showed no association with procedural outcomes. The results of ROC analysis showed good predictive power of PCT for both outcomes (AUC 0.75; p = 0.0003 for 30-day mortality and AUC 0.71; p < 0.0001 for 1-year mortality). An optimal cut-off value for PCT of 0.06 ng/ml for short- and long-term mortality was determined with the Youden index. A significantly higher mortality rate was observed in the high-PCT group (≥ 0.06 ng/ml) based on Kaplan-Meier analysis (log rank = 12.1; p = 0.001 at 30 days and log rank = 14.2; p = 0.0002 at 1 year). Patients in the high-PCT group also had a considerably worse clinical pro6file. In conclusion, preprocedural PCT is an independent predictor of 30-day and 1-year mortality after TAVI. In particular, a cut-off value of 0.06 ng/ml discriminates patients at higher risk of mortality within 30 days and 1 year of TAVI.",Fracture risk following intermission of osteoporosis therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175404,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2019 06 08,"Given the widespread practice of recommending drug holidays, we reviewed the impact of medication discontinuation of two common anti-osteoporosis therapies (bisphosphonates and denosumab).

They may help rationalise the operational organisation of imaging departments, optimise resource allocations, and improve image quality while decreasing radiation exposure and maintaining qualitative accuracy. There is already convincing data that show AI detection, and interpretation algorithms can perform with equal or higher diagnostic accuracy in various specific indications than experts in the field. Preliminary data strongly suggest that AI will be able to process imaging data and information well beyond what is visible to the human eye, and it will be able to integrate features to provide signatures that may further drive personalised medicine. As exciting as these prospects are, they currently remain essentially projects with a long way to go before full validation and routine clinical implementation. AI uses a language that is totally unfamiliar to nuclear medicine physicians, who have not been trained to manage the highly complex concepts that rely primarily on mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering. Nuclear medicine physicians are mostly familiar with biology, pharmacology, and physics, yet, considering the disruptive nature of AI in medicine, we need to start acquiring the knowledge that will keep us in the position of being actors and not merely witnesses of the wonders developed by other stakeholders in front of our incredulous eyes. This will allow us to remain a useful and valid interface between the image, the data, and the patients and free us to pursue other, one might say nobler tasks, such as treating, caring and communicating with our patients or conducting research and development."

Certain combinations of superconditioning TMS were capable of causing stronger inhibition or facilitation of MEPs compared to dual-pulse TMS, for both APB and TA target muscles. Moreover, there were multiple cases in which target muscles unresponsive to strong single-pulse TMS, whether at rest or when tested with an active contraction, showed an MEP in response to TMSsc optimized for facilitation. Our findings suggest that a multi-faceted neurophysiologic protocol for examining upper motor neuron function in MND subjects might benefit from inclusion of TMSsc testing.",Spatial and temporal influences on discrimination of vibrotactile stimuli on the arm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175382,Experimental brain research,2019 06 08,"Body-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a non-invasive way to control devices. Vibrotactile stimulation has been used by BMIs to provide performance feedback to the user, thereby reducing visual demands. To advance the goal of developing a compact, multivariate vibrotactile display for BMIs, we performed two psychophysical experiments to determine the acuity of vibrotactile perception across the arm. The first experiment assessed vibration intensity discrimination of sequentially presented stimuli within four dermatomes of the arm (C5, C7, C8, and T1) and on the ulnar head. The second experiment compared vibration intensity discrimination when pairs of vibrotactile stimuli were presented simultaneously vs. sequentially within and across dermatomes. The first experiment found a small but statistically significant difference between dermatomes C7 and T1, but discrimination thresholds at the other three locations did not differ. Thus, while all tested dermatomes of the arm and hand could serve as viable sites of vibrotactile stimulation for a practical BMI, ideal implementations should account for small differences in perceptual acuity across dermatomes. The second experiment found that sequential delivery of vibrotactile stimuli resulted in better intensity discrimination than simultaneous delivery, independent of whether the pairs were located within the same dermatome or across dermatomes. Taken together, our results suggest that the arm may be a viable site to transfer multivariate information via vibrotactile feedback for body-machine interfaces. However, user training may be needed to overcome the perceptual disadvantage of simultaneous vs. sequentially presented stimuli.",Can ADC be used as a surrogate marker of response to therapy in intestinal tuberculosis?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175381,Abdominal radiology (New York),2019 06 08,To evaluate the utility of Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in assessing treatment response in patients of intestinal tuberculosis (ITB).,[Open-door psychiatry and community mental health work].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175380,Der Nervenarzt,2019 06 08,"In connection with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, mental healthcare concepts increasingly focus on the prevention of violence and coercion.

Ausg. A,2019 06 08,"The introduction of molecular targeted agents has fundamentally changed the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A first wave of development was based on the improved understanding of tumor biology since the discovery of the importance of the von Hippel-Lindau gene as the key driver of the disease and paved the way for antiangiogenic agents. Of relevance is the overexpression of proangiogenic and proliferation-promoting factors (VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor) as well as an overactivation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway: the target structure is the ""mammalian target of rapamycin"" (mTOR) molecule, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferative processes. VEGF-, PDGF-, and mTOR-signals and signaling pathways are central targets of current targeted substances. A second wave is certainly to be seen in the development of therapeutic approaches with the targeted activation and modulation of the immune system, which has brought ""immunotherapy"" back into the focus of interest. Central development is the application of immune-checkpoint inhibitors, with the help of which (re-)activation of the cellular defense, especially of T cells, takes place, which per se holds the potential of a cytoreductive therapy by killing the tumor cells. Even though the prognosis has improved significantly due to the rapid development of recent years, treatment remains challenging as most patients experience progress, and long-term survival is only achieved in about 20% of cases because some patients are primarily refractory or do not respond.

The Hunt bumble bee, Bombus huntii Green, 1860, has been recognized as a suitable pollinator of crops and has a broad distribution in western North America, making it a viable candidate for commercialization. In this study, our goal was to characterize the foraging dynamics of B. huntii female workers under open field conditions. To accomplish this goal, we monitored three B. huntii colonies over an 8-wk period in the summer of 2012 in northern Utah. Using marked bees, we studied the relationship between foraging duration/offloading and pollen/nonvisible pollen collection. In total, we observed 921 foraging events across all three colonies. Of our observations, 82% (n = 756) were foraging events that included both a departure and arrival time observation. Average duration of pollen and nonpollen (i.e., nectar) trips across foragers is 41.86 ± 5.65 min (±SE) and 32.18 ± 5.89 min, respectively. Workers spent a significantly longer time offloading pollen in the nest after a foraging trip relative to workers without pollen present on their corbicula. Pollen foraging rate increases over the course of the day, likely due to the time it takes to learn how to forage on a diverse array of flower morphologies. Our study provides data on how long it takes for B. huntii to forage in open field conditions and will be useful when comparing foraging rates in controlled crop systems.",Open peroral endoscopic myotomy for the treatment of achalasia: a case series of 82 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175357,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,2019 06 08,"During peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), creation of the tunnel is highly technically demanding and mucosal injury is one of the most common potential complications. We explored a method without a submucosal tunnel, which we call open peroral endoscopic myotomy (O-POEM). This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of O-POEM. O-POEM was performed on 82 patients with achalasia. Treatment success was defined as an Eckardt score of less than or equal to 3 after the myotomy. Adverse events including operative and postoperative adverse events were recorded. Treatment success and procedure-related adverse events were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 18 months (range: 6-26 months), the treatment success (Eckhart score ≤3) was achieved in 96.3% of cases (mean score pre- vs. post-treatment (7.4 vs. 1.8); P < 0.001) with a recurrence of 3 cases. Ten patients (12.2%) had adverse events consisting of 2 cases of mediastinitis, 1 case of post-O-POEM bleeding, 1 case of subcutaneous emphysema, 6 cases of pleural effusion. Two cases of mediastinitis required intraprocedural drainage, and other patients were managed by endoscopy and conservative medical treatment. There were no deaths. No patients required surgical conversion. Clinical reflux occurred in 15.9% of patients (13/82). O-POEM was reliable and effective for the treatment of achalasia.

Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain an association between night work and female breast cancer, but the most likely is suppression of the hormone melatonin by light exposure at night. Three articles recently published in this journal describe aspects of exposure to light during night work. These articles and other evidence suggest that nighttime light levels may not always be sufficient to affect melatonin production, which could in part explain the inconsistencies in the epidemiological data. There is need to improve the specificity and reliability of exposure assessments in future epidemiological studies of night shift workers.",Targeting PARP and autophagy evoked synergistic lethality in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175354,Carcinogenesis,2019 06 08,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, has limited efficient therapeutic options. Here, we first demonstrated that simultaneously targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and autophagy could evoke striking synergistic lethality in HCC cells. Specifically, we found that the PARP inhibitor Niraparib induced cytotoxicity accompanied by significant autophagy formation and autophagic flux in HCC cells. Further experiments showed that Niraparib induced suppression of the Akt/mTOR pathway and activation of the Erk1/2 cascade, two typical signaling pathways related to autophagy. In addition, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was triggered, which was involved in Niraparib-induced autophagy. Blocking autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) in combination with Niraparib further enhanced cytotoxicity, induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in HCC cells. Synergistic inhibition was also observed in Huh7 xenografts in vivo. Mechanistically, we showed that autophagy inhibition abrogated Niraparib-induced cell cycle arrest and checkpoint activation. Cotreatment with CQ and Niraparib promoted the formation of γ-H2AX foci while inhibiting the recruitment of the homologous recombination (HR) repair protein RAD51 to double-strand break (DSB) sites. Thus, the present study developed a novel promising strategy for the management of HCC in the clinic and highlighted a potential approach to expand the application of PARP inhibitors.",Surgery to the primary tumor is associated with improved survival of patients with metastatic esophageal cancer: propensity score-matched analyses of a large retrospective cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175353,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,2019 06 08,"The survival advantage of surgery to the primary tumor for patients with distant metastatic esophageal cancer has not been adequately evaluated.

This study included a cohort of 4,367 metastatic esophageal cancer patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, registered from January 2004 to December 2014. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazardous models were used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for potential baseline confounding. Both EAC (median OS for surgery group vs. no-surgery group-14.0 vs. 9.0 months, P < 0.001) and ESCC (median OS for surgery vs. no-surgery group-11.0 vs. 7.0 months, P = 0.002) experienced survival benefits from surgery. We found that surgery to the primary tumor, when combined with chemotherapy, was associated with improved survival for patients with M1b disease, both EAC and ESCC, with a greater benefit observed in younger patients, and those with EAC.

PE is diagnosed clinically as new-onset hypertension with associated end organ damage after 20 weeks of gestation. Despite being diagnosed as a maternal syndrome, fetal experience of PE is a developmental insult with lifelong cognitive consequences. These cognitive alterations are associated with distorted neuroanatomy and cerebrovasculature, including a higher risk of stroke. The pathophysiology of a PE pregnancy is complex, with many factors potentially able to affect fetal development. Deficient pro-angiogenic factor expression is one aspect that may impair fetal vascularization, alter brain structure and affect future cognition. Of the pro-angiogenic growth factors, placental growth factor (PGF) is strongly linked to PE. Concentrations of PGF are inappropriately low in maternal blood both before and during a PE gestation. Fetal concentrations of PGF appear to mirror maternal circulating concentrations. Using Pgf-/- mice that may model effects of PE on offspring, we demonstrated altered central nervous system vascularization, neuroanatomy and behaviour. Overall, we propose that development of the fetal brain is impaired in PE, making the offspring of preeclamptic pregnancies a unique cohort with greater risk of altered cognition and cerebrovasculature. These individuals may benefit from early interventions, either pharmacological or environmental. The early neonatal period may be a promising window for intervention while the developing brain retains plasticity.",Solvent-assisted preparation of supported lipid bilayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175346,Nature protocols,2019 06 08,"The supported lipid bilayer (SLB) platform is a popular cell membrane mimic that is utilized in the chemical, biological, materials science, and medical fields. To date, SLB preparation has proven challenging because of the need for specialized fabrication equipment, domain-specific knowledge about topics relevant to lipid self-assembly, and extensive training in the interfacial science field. Existing methods, such as vesicle fusion, also work with only a narrow range of lipid compositions and material supports. Here, we describe a recently developed simple and versatile protocol to form SLBs. The protocol is simple because it requires minimal sample preparation and only basic microfluidics, making it technically accessible to researchers across different scientific disciplines. The protocol is versatile because it works on a wide range of material supports, such as silicon oxide, gold, and graphene, and is compatible with diverse lipid compositions, including sterols and signaling lipids. The main stages of the procedure involve dissolving a lipid sample in an organic solvent, depositing the lipid solution on a solid support, and replacing the organic solvent with aqueous buffer. In addition, we provide procedures for characterizing the quality of the prepared SLBs and present examples of biofunctionalization procedures. The protocol takes 1-2 h and is broadly useful in various application contexts, including clinical diagnostics, biosensing, and cellular interfaces."

While the prognostic significance of collagen fiber remodeling in invasive breast cancer has been studied, its role in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains poorly defined. Using image analysis, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the geometric characteristics of collagen surrounding DCIS. A large well-characterized cohort of DCIS comprising pure DCIS (n = 610) and DCIS coexisting with invasive carcinoma (n = 180) were histochemically stained for collagen using picrosirius red. ImageJ software was used to assess collagen density, degree of collagen fiber dispersion and directionality in relation to DCIS ducts' boundary. We developed a collagen prognostic index and evaluated its prognostic significance. A poor index was observed in 24% of the pure DCIS and was associated with determinants of high-risk DCIS including higher nuclear grade, comedo type necrosis, hormonal receptor negativity, HER2 positivity and high proliferation index. High collagen prognostic index was associated with the collagen remodeling protein prolyl-4-hydroxlase alpha subunit 2 and the hypoxia-related protein hypoxia inducible factor 1α. DCIS coexisting with invasive breast cancer had a higher collagen prognostic index than pure DCIS ( p < 0.0001). High index was an independent poor prognostic factor for DCIS recurrence for all recurrences (HR = 2.3, p = 0.005) and just invasive recurrences (HR = 3.4, p = 0.003). Interaction between collagen prognostic index and radiotherapy showed that the index was associated with poor outcome even with adjuvant radiotherapy ( p = 0.0001). Collagen reorganization around DCIS is associated with poor outcome and provides a potential predictor for disease progression and resistance to radiotherapy. Mechanistic studies are warranted to decipher the underlying mechanisms.","Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma with TFE3 strong positive immunostaining: morphology, immunohistochemistry, and FISH analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175325,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2019 06 08,"TFE3 is accepted as a good marker for the diagnosis of Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma.

We examined the expression of TFE3 using immunohistochemistry by automated Ventana BenchMark XT system in 1818 consecutive renal cell carcinomas and verified the strong positive cases with TFE3 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing. Among the 27 renal cell carcinomas with TFE3 strong positive immunostaining, 20 cases were diagnosed as Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma, and seven cases were diagnosed as clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Pale to eosinophilic flocculent cytoplasm and psammomatous calcification were seen only in Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinomas (P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis occurred in all four cases of Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinomas with pT3a stage, which had local recurrence and distant metastasis (two of them died) within 3 years. The expressions of Vimentin, CA-IX, AE1/AE3, and EMA were significantly different between them (P < 0.05).

Urine was analyzed for metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and breath was analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene. Median concentrations of PAH metabolites in urine increased from pre-firefighting to 3-h post firefighting for all job assignments. This change was greatest for firefighters assigned to attack and search with 2.3, 5.6, 3.9, and 1.4-fold median increases in pyrene, phenanthrene, naphthalene, and fluorene metabolites. Median exhaled breath concentrations of benzene increased 2-fold for attack and search firefighters (p < 0.01) and 1.4-fold for outside vent firefighters (p = 0.02). Compared to interior attack, transitional attack resulted in 50% less uptake of pyrene (p = 0.09), 36% less uptake phenanthrene (p = 0.052), and 20% less uptake of fluorene (p < 0.01). Dermal absorption likely contributed to firefighters' exposures in this study. Firefighters' exposures will vary by job assignment and can be reduced by employing a transitional fire attack when feasible.","Bioactivity of the Cymbopogon citratus (Poaceae) essential oil and its terpenoid constituents on the predatory bug, Podisus nigrispinus (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175321,Scientific reports,2019 06 16,"Podisus nigrispinus Dallas (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), released in biological control programs, is a predator of Lepidopteran and Coleopteran species.

Six concentrations of lemongrass essential oil and of its citral and geranyl acetate constituents were applied to the thorax of P. nigrispinus nymphs and adults. The walking and respiratory behavior of the P. nigrispinus third-instar nymphs, treated with citral and geranyl acetate at the LD50 and LD90 doses, were analyzed with video and respirometer. The lemongrass essential oil toxicity increased from first- to fifth-instar P. nigrispinus nymphs.

Podisus nigrispinus adults were tolerant to the lemongrass essential oil and its constituents, geranyl acetate and citral. The altered respiratory activity with geranyl acetate and the fact that they were irritated and repelled by citral suggest caution with regard to the use of the lemongrass essential oil and its constituents in integrated pest management incorporating this predator, in order to avoid diminishing its efficiency against the pests.",Fast and reliable advanced two-step pore-size analysis of biomimetic 3D extracellular matrix scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175320,Scientific reports,2019 06 08,"The tissue microenvironment is a major contributor to cellular functions, such as cell adhesion, migration and invasion. A critical physical parameter for determining the effect of the microenvironment on cellular functions is the average pore-size of filamentous scaffolds, such as 3D collagen fiber matrices, which are assembled by the polymerization of biopolymers. The scaffolds of these matrices can be analyzed easily by using state-of-the-art laser scanning confocal imaging. However, the generation of a quantitative estimate of the pore-size in a 3D microenvironment is not trivial. In this study, we present a reliable and fast analytical method, which relies on a two-step 3D pore-size analysis utilizing several state-of-the-art image analysis methods, such as total variation (TV) denoising and adaptive local thresholds, and another crucial parameter, such as pore-coverage. We propose an iterative approach of pore-size analysis to determine even the smallest and obscure pores in a collagen scaffold. Additionally, we propose a novel parameter, the pseudo-pore-size, which describes a virtual scaffold porosity. In order to validate the advanced two-step pore-size analysis different types of artificial collagens, such as a rat and bovine mixture with two different collagen concentrations have been utilized. Additionally, we compare a traditional approach with our method using an artificially generated network with predefined pore-size distributions. Indeed, our analytical method provides a precise, fast and parameter-free, user-independent and automatic analysis of 3D pore topology, such as pore-sizes and pore-coverage. Additionally, we are able to determine non-physiological network topologies by taking the pore-coverage as a goodness-of-fit parameter.",Long-acting CCK analogue NN9056 lowers food intake and body weight in obese Göttingen Minipigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175319,International journal of obesity (2005),2019 06 08,"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a regulator of appetite and energy intake in man.

Here, we hypothesized that the embryo modulates the biochemical composition of the uterine luminal fluid (ULF) in the most cranial portion of the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum. Endometrial samples and ULF were collected post-mortem from sham-inseminated cows and from cows inseminated and detected pregnant 7 days after oestrus. We used quantitative mass spectrometry to demonstrate that the pre-hatching embryo changes ULF composition in vivo. Embryo-induced modulation included an increase in concentrations of lipoxygenase-derived metabolites [12(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE] and a decrease in the concentrations of amino acids (glycine), biogenic amines (sarcosine), acylcarnitines and phospholipids. The changed composition of the ULF could be due to secretion or depletion of specific molecules, executed by either the embryo or the endometrium, but initiated by signals coming from the embryo. This study provides the basis for further understanding embryo-initiated modulation of the uterine milieu. Early embryonic signalling may be necessary to guarantee optimal development and successful establishment of pregnancy in cattle.",Field Correlations in Surface Plasmon Speckle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175316,Scientific reports,2019 06 16,In this work fluctuations in the electric field of surface plasmon polaritons undergoing random scattering on a rough metallic surface are considered. A rigorous closed form analytic expression is derived describing second order correlations in the resulting plasmon speckle pattern assuming statistically stationary and isotropic roughness. Partially coherent planar Schell-model source fields can also be described within the developed framework. Behaviour of the three-dimensional degree of cross polarisation and spectral degree of coherence is also discussed. Expressions derived take full account of dissipation in the metal with non-universal behaviour exhibited within the correlation length of the surface and source fields.,Binary-phase acoustic passive logic gates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175315,Scientific reports,2019 06 08,"The recent rapid development of acoustic logic devices has opened up the possibilities of sound computing and information processing. However, simultaneous realization of acoustic logic devices with subwavelength size, broad bandwidth and passive structure still poses a great challenge. To overcome it, we propose a subwavelength acoustic logic gate which consists of binary-phase passive unit cells placed into a multi-port waveguide. Based on the phase manipulations of the unit cells, we experimentally and numerically realize three basic logic gates OR, NOT and AND, and a composite logic gate XOR with a uniform threshold of 0.4 Pa based on linear acoustic interferences. More importantly, We also design a composite logic gate XNOR by a four-port waveguide, and composite logic gates NOR and NAND and a logic operation A⊙(B+C) based on two logic gates. We demonstrate a 0.6λ-length, 0.3λ-width, and 0.2-fractional bandwidth acoustic logic gate constructed by passive structures, which may lead to important advances in various applications, such as acoustic computing, acoustic information processing and integrated acoustics.",Nectar robbing in bellflower (Sesamum radiatum) benefited pollinators but unaffected maternal function of plant reproduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175314,Scientific reports,2019 06 16,"Nectar robbing - foraging nectar illegitimately - has negative, neutral, or positive effects on maternal function of plant reproduction and/or on pollinators. It has been suggested that nectar robbing has a non-negative effect on maternal function of plant reproduction in autogamous and mixed breeding plants; however this hypothesis requires deeper understanding with more studies. We investigated the impact of natural nectar robbing on maternal function of plant reproduction and visitation characteristics of pollinators in Sesamum radiatum, an autogamous plant. Pollinators were observed on unrobbed open flowers and robbed open flowers. In robbed flowers, pollinators' visit type and foraging time were examined. The seed sets of these flower types were examined. Xylocopa latipes was both a primary robber and a legitimate pollinator, X. bryorum was an exclusive primary robber, and Megachile disjuncta was a cosmopolitan pollinator. In robbed flowers, most of the pollinators foraged mostly as secondary nectar robbers. The foraging time shortened considerably when pollinators robbed nectar - a positive effect on pollinators' foraging efficiency. Robbing did not negatively affect seed set - a neutral effect on the plant's reproduction. Our study agrees that nectar robbing might have a non-negative effect on reproduction in autogamous and mixed breeding plants."

The size of confined droplets is controlled by the ratio between shear and capillary forces when both are of the same order, in a regime known as jetting, while being surprisingly insensitive to this ratio when shear is orders of magnitude smaller than capillary forces, in a regime known as squeezing. Here, we reveal that further reduction of-already negligibly small-shear unexpectedly re-introduces the dependence of droplet size on shear/capillary-force ratio. For the first time we formally account for the flow around forming droplets, to predict and discover experimentally an additional regime-leaking. Our model predicts droplet size and characterizes the transitions from leaking into squeezing and from squeezing into jetting, unifying the description for confined droplet generation, and offering a practical guide for applications.",Tau local structure shields an amyloid-forming motif and controls aggregation propensity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175300,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by intracellular amyloid deposits of tau protein. Missense mutations in the tau gene (MAPT) correlate with aggregation propensity and cause dominantly inherited tauopathies, but their biophysical mechanism driving amyloid formation is poorly understood. Many disease-associated mutations localize within tau's repeat domain at inter-repeat interfaces proximal to amyloidogenic sequences, such as 306VQIVYK311. We use cross-linking mass spectrometry, recombinant protein and synthetic peptide systems, in silico modeling, and cell models to conclude that the aggregation-prone 306VQIVYK311 motif forms metastable compact structures with its upstream sequence that modulates aggregation propensity. We report that disease-associated mutations, isomerization of a critical proline, or alternative splicing are all sufficient to destabilize this local structure and trigger spontaneous aggregation. These findings provide a biophysical framework to explain the basis of early conformational changes that may underlie genetic and sporadic tau pathogenesis.",All-polymer particulate slurry batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175299,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Redox flow batteries are promising for large-scale energy storage, but some long-standing problems such as safety issues, system cost and cycling stability must be resolved. Here we demonstrate a type of redox flow battery that is based on all-polymer particulate slurry electrolytes. Micro-sized and uniformly dispersed all-polymer particulate suspensions are utilized as redox-active materials in redox flow batteries, breaking through the solubility limit and facilitating the application of insoluble redox-active materials. Expensive ion-exchange membranes are replaced by commercial dialysis membranes, which can simultaneously realize the rapid shuttling of H+ ions and cut off the migration of redox-active particulates across the separator via size exclusion. In result, the all-polymer particulate slurry redox flow batteries exhibit a highly reversible multi-electron redox process, rapid electrochemical kinetics and ultra-stable long-term cycling capability.",Graphite phase carbon nitride based membrane for selective permeation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175298,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Precise control of interlayer spacing and functionality is crucial in two-dimensional material based membrane separation technology. Here we show anion intercalation in protonated graphite phase carbon nitride (GCN) that tunes the interlayer spacing and functions of GCN-based membranes for selective permeation in aqueous/organic solutions. Sulfate anion intercalation leads to a crystalline and amphipathic membrane with an accessible interlayer spacing at ~10.8 Å, which allows high solvent permeability and sieves out the solutes with sizes larger than the spacing. We further extend the concept and illustrate the example of GCN-based chiral membrane via incorporating (1R)-(-)-10-camphorsulfonic anion into protonated GCN layers. The membrane exhibits a molecular weight cutoff around 150 among various enantiomers and highly enantioselective permeation towards limonene racemate with an enantiomeric excess value of 89%. This work paves a feasible way to achieve water purification and chiral separation technologies using decorated laminated membranes.",Correlations as a resource in quantum thermodynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175297,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"The presence of correlations in physical systems can be a valuable resource for many quantum information tasks. They are also relevant in thermodynamic transformations, and their creation is usually associated to some energetic cost. In this work, we study the role of correlations in the thermodynamic process of state formation in the single-shot regime, and find that correlations can also be viewed as a resource. First, we show that the energetic cost of creating multiple copies of a given state can be reduced by allowing correlations in the final state. We obtain the minimum cost for every finite number of subsystems, and then we show that this feature is not restricted to the case of copies. More generally, we demonstrate that in the asymptotic limit, by allowing a logarithmic amount of correlations, we can recover standard results where the free energy quantifies this minimum cost.",Transcriptome of dorsal root ganglia caudal to a spinal cord injury with modulated behavioral activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175296,Scientific data,2019 06 08,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating clinical condition resulting in significant disabilities. Apart from local injury within the spinal cord, SCI patients develop a myriad of complications including multi-organ dysfunction. Some of the dysfunctions may be directly or indirectly related to the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which signal to both the spinal cord and the peripheral organs. After SCI, some classes of DRG neurons exhibit sensitization and undergo axonal sprouting both peripherally and centrally. Such physiological and anatomical re-organization after SCI contributes to both adaptive and maladaptive plasticity processes, which may be modulated by activity and exercise. In this study, we collected comprehensive gene expression data in whole DRG below the levels of the injury to compare the effects of SCI with and without two different forms of exercise in rats.",Comprehensive analysis of coding variants highlights genetic complexity in developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175295,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"Although there are many known Mendelian genes linked to epileptic or developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (EE/DEE), its genetic architecture is not fully explained. Here, we address this incompleteness by analyzing exomes of 743 EE/DEE cases and 2366 controls. We observe that damaging ultra-rare variants (dURVs) unique to an individual are significantly overrepresented in EE/DEE, both in known EE/DEE genes and the other non-EE/DEE genes. Importantly, enrichment of dURVs in non-EE/DEE genes is significant, even in the subset of cases with diagnostic dURVs (P = 0.000215), suggesting oligogenic contribution of non-EE/DEE gene dURVs. Gene-based analysis identifies exome-wide significant (P = 2.04 × 10-6) enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in NF1, a gene primarily linked to neurofibromatosis, in infantile spasm. Together with accumulating evidence for roles of oligogenic or modifier variants in severe neurodevelopmental disorders, our results highlight genetic complexity in EE/DEE, and indicate that EE/DEE is not an aggregate of simple Mendelian disorders.",Comprehensive study of nuclear receptor DNA binding provides a revised framework for understanding receptor specificity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175293,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"The type II nuclear receptors (NRs) function as heterodimeric transcription factors with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate diverse biological processes in response to endogenous ligands and therapeutic drugs.

Here we use protein-binding microarrays (PBMs) to comprehensively analyze the DNA binding of 12 NR:RXRα dimers. We find more promiscuous NR-DNA binding than has been reported, challenging the view that NR binding specificity is defined by half-site spacing. We show that NRs bind DNA using two distinct modes, explaining widespread NR binding to half-sites in vivo. Finally, we show that the current models of NR specificity better reflect binding-site activity rather than binding-site affinity. Our rich dataset and revised NR binding models provide a framework for understanding NR regulatory specificity and will facilitate more accurate analyses of genomic datasets.",Structural and functional consequences of the STAT5BN642H driver mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175292,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"Hyper-activated STAT5B variants are high value oncology targets for pharmacologic intervention. STAT5BN642H, a frequently-occurring oncogenic driver mutation, promotes aggressive T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in patient carriers, although the molecular origins remain unclear. Herein, we emphasize the aggressive nature of STAT5BN642H in driving T-cell neoplasia upon hematopoietic expression in transgenic mice, revealing evidence of multiple T-cell subset organ infiltration. Notably, we demonstrate STAT5BN642H-driven transformation of γδ T-cells in in vivo syngeneic transplant models, comparable to STAT5BN642H patient γδ T-cell entities. Importantly, we present human STAT5B and STAT5BN642H crystal structures, which propose alternative mutation-mediated SH2 domain conformations. Our biophysical data suggests STAT5BN642H can adopt a hyper-activated and hyper-inactivated state with resistance to dephosphorylation. MD simulations support sustained interchain cross-domain interactions in STAT5BN642H, conferring kinetic stability to the mutant anti-parallel dimer. This study provides a molecular explanation for the STAT5BN642H activating potential, and insights into pre-clinical models for targeted intervention of hyper-activated STAT5B.",Full-field structured-illumination super-resolution X-ray transmission microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175291,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Modern transmission X-ray microscopy techniques provide very high resolution at low and medium X-ray energies, but suffer from a limited field-of-view.

Here, we present a method for fast full-field super-resolution transmission microscopy by structured illumination of the specimen. This technique is well-suited even for hard X-ray energies above 30 keV, where efficient optics are hard to obtain. Accordingly, investigation of optically thick specimen becomes possible with our method combining a wide field-of-view spanning multiple millimetres, or even centimetres, with sub-micron resolution and hard X-ray energies."

The tomographic display consists of focus-tunable optics, a display panel, and a fast spatially adjustable backlight. The synchronization of the focus-tunable optics and the backlight enables the display panel to express the depth information.

Mutant cells show decreased levels and altered distribution of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). How these chromatin changes are established genome-wide and lead to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we show that H3.3K27M-mediated alterations in H3K27me3 distribution result in ectopic DNA replication and cell cycle progression of germ cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. By genetically inducing changes in the H3.3 distribution, we demonstrate that both H3.3K27M and pre-existing H3K27me3 act locally and antagonistically on Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in a concentration-dependent manner. The heterochromatin changes result in extensive gene misregulation, and genetic screening identified upregulation of JNK as an underlying cause of the germcell aberrations. Moreover, JNK inhibition suppresses the replicative fate in human tumor-derived H3.3K27M cells, thus establishing C. elegans as a powerful model for the identification of potential drug targets for treatment of H3.3K27M tumors.",In vivo nuclear capture and molecular profiling identifies Gmeb1 as a transcriptional regulator essential for dopamine neuron function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175277,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"Midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons play a central role in reward signaling and are widely implicated in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. To understand how mDA neurons perform these functions, it is important to understand how mDA-specific genes are regulated. However, cellular heterogeneity in the mammalian brain presents a major challenge to obtaining this understanding. To this end, we developed a virus-based approach to label and capture mDA nuclei for transcriptome (RNA-Seq), and low-input chromatin accessibility (liDNase-Seq) profiling, followed by predictive modeling to identify putative transcriptional regulators of mDA neurons. Using this method, we identified Gmeb1, a transcription factor predicted to regulate expression of Th and Dat, genes critical for dopamine synthesis and reuptake, respectively. Gmeb1 knockdown in mDA neurons resulted in downregulation of Th and Dat, as well as in severe motor deficits. This study thus identifies Gmeb1 as a master regulator of mDA gene expression and function, and provides a general method for identifying cell type-specific transcriptional regulators.",Over 16% efficiency organic photovoltaic cells enabled by a chlorinated acceptor with increased open-circuit voltages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175276,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Broadening the optical absorption of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials by enhancing the intramolecular push-pull effect is a general and effective method to improve the power conversion efficiencies of OPV cells. However, in terms of the electron acceptors, the most common molecular design strategy of halogenation usually results in down-shifted molecular energy levels, thereby leading to decreased open-circuit voltages in the devices. Herein, we report a chlorinated non-fullerene acceptor, which exhibits an extended optical absorption and meanwhile displays a higher voltage than its fluorinated counterpart in the devices. This unexpected phenomenon can be ascribed to the reduced non-radiative energy loss (0.206 eV). Due to the simultaneously improved short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage, a high efficiency of 16.5% is achieved. This study demonstrates that finely tuning the OPV materials to reduce the bandgap-voltage offset has great potential for boosting the efficiency.",Importance of potassium ions for ribosome structure and function revealed by long-wavelength X-ray diffraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175275,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"The ribosome, the largest RNA-containing macromolecular machinery in cells, requires metal ions not only to maintain its three-dimensional fold but also to perform protein synthesis. Despite the vast biochemical data regarding the importance of metal ions for efficient protein synthesis and the increasing number of ribosome structures solved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy, the assignment of metal ions within the ribosome remains elusive due to methodological limitations. Here we present extensive experimental data on the potassium composition and environment in two structures of functional ribosome complexes obtained by measurement of the potassium anomalous signal at the K-edge, derived from long-wavelength X-ray diffraction data. We elucidate the role of potassium ions in protein synthesis at the three-dimensional level, most notably, in the environment of the ribosome functional decoding and peptidyl transferase centers.

Thus, to capture a substantial portion of the genetic contribution, effects from many variants need to be aggregated. We investigated various aspects of one such approach that has been successfully applied to many traits, polygenic risk score (PRS) for PTSD. Theoretical analyses indicate the potential prediction ability of PRS. We used the latest summary statistics from the largest published genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for PTSD (PGC-PTSD). We found that the PRS constructed for a cohort comprising veterans of recent wars (n = 244) explains a considerable proportion of PTSD onset (Nagelkerke R2 = 4.68%, P = 0.003) and severity (R2 = 4.35%, P = 0.0008) variances. However, the performance on an African ancestry sub-cohort was minimal. A PRS constructed with schizophrenia GWAS also explained a significant fraction of PTSD diagnosis variance (Nagelkerke R2 = 2.96%, P = 0.0175), confirming previously reported genetic correlation between the two psychiatric ailments. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important role polygenic analyses of PTSD will play in risk prediction models as well as in elucidating the biology of the disorder.","Antidepressant treatment, not depression, leads to reductions in behavioral and neural responses to pain empathy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175273,Translational psychiatry,2019 06 08,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been hypothesized to lead to impairments in empathy. Previous cross-sectional studies did not disentangle effects of MDD itself and antidepressant treatment. In this first longitudinal neuroimaging study on empathy in depression, 29 patients with MDD participated in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions before and after 3 months of antidepressant therapy. We compared their responses to an empathy for pain task to a group of healthy controls (N = 35). All participants provided self-report ratings targeting cognitive (perspective taking) and affective (unpleasant affect) aspects of empathy. To control for general effects on processing of negative affective states, participants additionally underwent an electrical pain task. Before treatment, we found no differences in empathic responses between controls and patients with MDD. After treatment, patients showed significant decreases in both affective empathy and activity of three a priori selected brain regions associated with empathy for pain. Decreases in affective empathy were moreover correlated with symptom improvement. Moreover, functional connectivity during the empathy task between areas associated with affective (anterior insula) and cognitive (precuneus) empathy decreased between sessions in the MDD group. Neither cognitive empathy nor responses to painful electrical shocks were changed after treatment. These findings contradict previous cross-sectional reports of empathy deficits in acute MDD. Rather, they suggest that antidepressant treatment reduces the aversive responses triggered by exposure to the suffering of others. Importantly, this cannot be explained by a general blunting of negative affect, as treatment did not change self-experienced pain.",Testosterone imbalance may link depression and increased body weight in premenopausal women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175272,Translational psychiatry,2019 06 08,"Accumulating evidence supports a link between depression and being overweight in women. Given previously reported sex differences in fat accumulation and depression prevalence, as well as the likely role of sex hormones in both overweight and mood disorders, we hypothesised that the depression-overweight association may be mediated by sex hormones. To this end, we investigated the association of being overweight with depression, and then considered the role of sex hormones in relation to being overweight and depression in a large population-based cohort. We included a total of 3124 women, 970 premenopausal and 2154 postmenopausal from the LIFE-Adult cohort study in our analyses. We evaluated associations between being overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2), sex hormone levels, and depressive symptomatology according to Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scores, and explored mediation of depression in a mediation model. Being overweight was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in premenopausal but not postmenopausal women. Both premenopausal and postmenopausal overweight women had higher free testosterone levels compared with normal weight women. Premenopausal women with depressive symptomatology had higher free testosterone levels compared to women without. We found a significant mediation effect of depressive symptomatology in overweight premenopausal women through free testosterone level. These findings highlight the association between being overweight and depressed, and suggest that high free testosterone levels may play a significant role in depression of overweight premenopausal women. Based on this, pharmacological approaches targeting androgen levels in overweight depressed females, in particular when standard anti-depressive treatments fail, could be of specific clinical relevance.",A novel YAP1/SLC35B4 regulatory axis contributes to proliferation and progression of gastric carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175271,Cell death & disease,2019 06 08,"Solute carrier family 35 member B4 (SLC35B4), a nucleotide sugar transporter, is capable of transporting UDP-xylose and UDP-GlcNAc from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. SLC35B4 has a pivotal role in glycosylation of biological macromolecules. However, its functional roles and regulatory mechanisms in malignant diseases remain unknown. Here, using the cDNA arrays, promoter reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that SLC35B4 is directly transactivated by YAP1-TEADs complex in gastric cancer (GC) cells. CCK-8, plate colony formation and soft agar assays revealed that SLC35B4 is essential for survival and proliferation in GC cells and nude mice models. SLC35B4 expression is markedly higher in GC tissues compared with control noncancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that SLC35B4 expression is positively correlated with YAP1 expression in human GC tissues, and this correlation is also confirmed in the GC TCGA data set. GC patients with high levels of SLC35B4 expression have poorer prognosis than those with low levels of SLC35B4 expression. Collectively, our findings defined SLC35B4 as an important downstream oncogenic target of YAP1, suggesting that dysregulated signaling of a novel YAP1/SLC35B4 axis promotes GC development and progression, and this axis could be a potential candidate for prognosis and therapeutics in GC.",Cardiac structure and function in patients with schizophrenia taking antipsychotic drugs: an MRI study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175270,Translational psychiatry,2019 06 08,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of excess mortality in schizophrenia. Preclinical evidence shows antipsychotics can cause myocardial fibrosis and myocardial inflammation in murine models, but it is not known if this is the case in patients. We therefore set out to determine if there is evidence of cardiac fibrosis and/or inflammation using cardiac MRI in medicated patients with schizophrenia compared with matched healthy controls. Thirty-one participants (14 patients and 17 controls) underwent cardiac MRI assessing myocardial markers of fibrosis/inflammation, indexed by native myocardial T1 time, and cardiac structure (left ventricular (LV) mass) and function (left/right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, stroke volumes, and ejection fractions). Participants were physically fit, and matched for age, gender, smoking, blood pressure, BMI, HbA1c, ethnicity, and physical activity. Compared with controls, native myocardial T1 was significantly longer in patients with schizophrenia (effect size, d = 0.89; p = 0.02). Patients had significantly lower LV mass, and lower left/right ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes (effect sizes, d = 0.86-1.08; all p-values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in left/right end-systolic volumes and ejection fractions between groups (p > 0.05). These results suggest an early diffuse fibro-inflammatory myocardial process in patients that is independent of established CVD-risk factors and could contribute to the excess cardiovascular mortality associated with schizophrenia. Future studies are required to determine if this is due to antipsychotic treatment or is intrinsic to schizophrenia."

In this study, we investigated the TOR pathway by functionally characterizing two Tor-like kinases, Tor1 and Tlk1, in C. neoformans We successfully deleted TLK1, but not TOR1TLK1 deletion did not result in any evident in vitro phenotypes, suggesting that Tlk1 is dispensable for the growth of C. neoformans We demonstrated that Tor1, but not Tlk1, is essential and the target of rapamycin by constructing and analyzing conditionally regulated strains and sporulation analysis of heterozygous mutants in the diploid strain background. To further analyze the Tor1 function, we constructed constitutive TOR1 overexpression strains. Tor1 negatively regulated thermotolerance and the DNA damage response, which are two important virulence factors of C. neoformansTOR1 overexpression reduced Mpk1 phosphorylation, which is required for cell wall integrity and thermoresistance, and Rad53 phosphorylation, which governs the DNA damage response pathway. Tor1 is localized to the cytoplasm but enriched in the vacuole membrane. Phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics revealed that Tor1 regulates a variety of biological processes, including metabolic processes, cytoskeleton organization, ribosome biogenesis, and stress response. TOR inhibition by rapamycin caused actin depolarization in a Tor1-dependent manner. Finally, screening rapamycin-sensitive and -resistant kinase and transcription factor mutants revealed that the TOR pathway may crosstalk with a number of stress signaling pathways. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a single Tor1 kinase plays pleiotropic roles in C. neoformans.",Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors Function Redundantly During Zebrafish Embryonic Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175226,Genetics,2019 06 08,"Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling regulates many processes during development. In most cases, one tissue layer secretes an Fgf ligand that binds and activates an Fgf receptor (Fgfr) expressed by a neighboring tissue. Although studies have identified the roles of specific Fgf ligands during development, less is known about the requirements for the receptors. We have generated null mutations in each of the five fgfr genes in zebrafish. Considering the diverse requirements for Fgf signaling throughout development and that null mutations in the mouse Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 genes are embryonic lethal, it was surprising that all zebrafish homozygous mutants are viable and fertile, with no discernable embryonic defect. Instead, we find that multiple receptors are involved in coordinating most Fgf-dependent developmental processes. For example, mutations in the ligand fgf8a cause loss of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, whereas in the fgfr mutants, this phenotype is only seen in embryos that are triple mutant for fgfr1a;fgfr1b;fgfr2, but not in any single or double mutant combinations. We show that this apparent fgfr redundancy is also seen during the development of several other tissues, including posterior mesoderm, pectoral fins, viscerocranium, and neurocranium. These data are an essential step towards defining the specific Fgfrs that function with particular Fgf ligands to regulate important developmental processes in zebrafish.",G-CSF partially mediates the bone loss induced by Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175224,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2019 06 08,"Bone loss in Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) osteomyelitis poses a serious challenge to orthopaedic treatment. This study aimed to elucidate how S. aureus infection in bone might induce bone loss. The C57BL/6 mice were injected with S. aureus (106 CFU/ml, 100 μl) or with the same amount of vehicle (control) via the tail vein. MicroCT analysis showed bone loss progressing from week 1 to week 5 after infection, accompanied by a decreased number of osteocalcin-positive stained osteoblasts and the suppressed mRNA expression of Runx2 and osteocalcin. Transcriptome profiles of GSE30119 were downloaded and analyzed to determine the differences in expression of inflammatory factors between patients with S. aureus infected osteomyelitis and healthy controls, the data showed significantly higher mRNA expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the whole blood from patients with S. aureus infection. ELISA analysis confirmed an increased level of G-CSF in the bone marrow and serum from S. aureus infected mice, which might have been due to the increased amount of F4/80+ macrophages. Interestingly, G-CSF neutralizing antibody treatment significantly rescued the bone loss after S. aureus infection, as evidenced by its roles in improving BV/TV and preserving osteocalcin- and osterix-positive stained cells. Importantly, we found that G-CSF level was significantly up-regulated in the serum from osteomyelitis patients infected by S. aureus Together, S. aureus infection might suppress the function of osteoblastic cells and induce progressive bone loss by up-regulating the level G-CSF, suggesting a therapeutic potential for G-CSF neutralization in combating bone loss in S. aureus osteomyelitis.",Comparison of postmortem inspection procedures for detecting caseous lymphadenitis of Australian sheep and goats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175223,The Veterinary record,2019 06 14,"Alternative postmortem inspection procedures for the detection of gross abnormalities due to Caseous Lymphadenitis (CLA) of sheep and goats were compared quantitatively against the current Australian Standard (AS4696). Studies on sheep and goats in Australia during 2016 addressed data gaps regarding current prevalence, combinations of multiple lesions within affected carcases and sensitivity of inspection procedures enabling a comparison of alternative with current procedures. Using these contemporary inspection data from 54 915 sheep and 48 577 goats a desktop study estimated the effect of implementing alternative procedures of reduced palpation from eleven carcase sites to the four sites most commonly affected. Under current procedures it was estimated that 86 sheep and 34 goat carcases with CLA lesions are missed per 10,000 carcases. Under alternative procedures it is estimated that an additional 48.4 sheep and 10.5 goat carcases with CLA lesions would be missed per 10 000 carcases. Of these, 38.2 sheep and 5.6 goat per 10 000 carcases would contain CLA only in routinely discarded, non-edible tissue sites. Hence, only an additional 10.2 sheep and 4.9 goat carcases per 10 000 inspected, with CLA in edible tissue sites are estimated to be missed. These alternative procedures have now been officially implemented in the Australian domestic standard.",Prevalence of and risk factors for acute laminitis in horses treated with corticosteroids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175222,The Veterinary record,2019 06 08,"A retrospective treated versus untreated study (study 1) and multicentre prospective cohort study (study 2) were undertaken to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, acute laminitis in horses treated with corticosteroids.

It is currently not known if pre-existing TRP skills on non-pregnant cows can be used to predict students' future PD accuracy. The study objective was to evaluate if TRP objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores can predict students' future PD accuracy.Fourth year (of a six-year programme) veterinary students (n=128) received TRP and PD training on Breed'n Betsy (BB) simulators and live cows. Students' TRP skills were assessed using a live cow TRP OSCE after completion of the fourth year training. The same students received additional TRP (BB and live cows) and PD (BB) training sessions in the first semester of their fifth year. PD accuracy was assessed after the additional TRP and PD training, five months after the TRP OSCE assessment and measured as sensitivity and specificity (the ability to correctly identify the presence and absence of pregnancy, respectively). Each student palpated six cows transrectally to diagnose pregnancy status and stage for the PD assessment. The TRP OSCE results were analysed as predictors for students' PD accuracy.Students with 'competent palpation skills' on the TRP OSCE had higher PD specificity. The individual OSCE components that were predictive of higher PD accuracy were students' ability to estimate ovarian size, identify uterine position and exclude intrauterine fluid. It was concluded that a TRP OSCE has the ability to predict students' future PD accuracy.",Mechanistic basis of cabotegravir-glucuronide disposition in humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175220,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 06 08,"Cabotegravir, a novel integrase inhibitor under development for treatment and prevention of HIV, is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 to a direct ether glucuronide metabolite. The aim of these studies was to elucidate the mechanistic basis of cabotegravir-glucuronide disposition in humans. Cabotegravir glucuronidation was predominantly hepatic (>95%) with minimal intestinal and renal contribution. Rat liver perfusions demonstrated that cabotegravir-glucuronide formed in the liver undergoes comparable biliary and sinusoidal excretion, consistent with high concentrations of the glucuronide in human bile and urine. Cabotegravir-glucuronide biliary excretion was mediated by MRP2 (not transported by BCRP or P-gp), while hepatic basolateral excretion into sinusoidal blood was via both MRP3 (Ft=0.81) and MRP4 (Ft=0.19). Surprisingly, despite high urinary recovery of hepatically-formed cabotegravir-glucuronide, metabolite levels in circulation were negligible, a phenomenon consistent with rapid metabolite clearance. Cabotegravir-glucuronide was transported by hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3; however, metabolite clearance by hepatic uptake from circulation was low (2.7% of hepatic blood flow) and unable to explain the minimal systemic exposure. Instead, circulating cabotegravir-glucuronide undergoes efficient renal clearance, where uptake into the proximal tubule would be mediated by OAT3 (not transported by OAT1), and subsequent secretion into urine by MRP2 (Ft=0.66) and MRP4 (Ft=0.34). These studies provide mechanistic insight into the disposition of cabotegravir-glucuronide, a hepatically-formed metabolite with appreciable urinary recovery and minimal systemic exposure, including fractional contribution of redundant transporters to any given process based on quantitative proteomics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The role of membrane transporters in metabolite disposition, especially glucuronides, and as sites of unexpected drug-drug interactions, which alter drug efficacy and safety, has been established. Cabotegravir-glucuronide, formed predominantly by direct glucuronidation of parent drug in liver, was the major metabolite recovered in human urine (27% of oral dose) but was surprisingly not detected in systemic circulation. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanistic description of this phenomenon for a major hepatically-formed metabolite to be excreted in the urine to a large extent but not circulate at detectable levels. The present study elucidates the mechanistic basis of cabotegravir-glucuronide disposition in humans. Specific hepatic and renal transporters involved in the disposition of cabotegravir-glucuronide, with their fractional contribution, has been provided.",Engineered Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) for Targeting Solid Tumors: Therapeutic Potential beyond Regenerative Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175219,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 06 08,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have previously demonstrated considerable promise in regenerative medicine based on their ability to proliferate and differentiate into cells of different lineages. More recently, there has been a significant interest in using MSCs as cellular vehicles for targeted cancer therapy by exploiting their tumor homing properties. Initial studies focused on using genetically modified MSCs for targeted delivery of various pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic and therapeutic proteins to a wide variety of tumors. However, their use as drug delivery vehicles has been limited by poor drug load capacity. This review discusses various strategies for the non-genetic modification of MSCs that allows their use in tumor targeted delivery of small molecule chemotherapeutic agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: There has been a considerable interest in exploiting the tumor homing potential of MSCs to develop them as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor tissue. The inherent tumor-tropic and drug-resistant properties make MSCs ideal carriers for toxic payload. While significant progress has been made in the area of the genetic modification of MSCs, studies focused on identification of molecular mechanisms that contribute to the tumor tropism along with optimization of the engineering conditions can further improve their effectiveness as drug delivery vehicles."

While altered signals from the viscera contribute to clinical symptoms, the brain integrates these interoceptive signals with emotional, cognitive and memory related inputs in a non-linear fashion to produce symptoms. Tremendous progress has occurred in the development of new imaging techniques that look at structural, functional and metabolic properties of brain regions and networks. Standardisation in image acquisition and advances in computational approaches has made it possible to study large data sets of imaging studies, identify network properties and integrate them with non-imaging data. These approaches are beginning to generate brain signatures in IBS that share some features with those obtained in other often overlapping chronic pain disorders such as urological pelvic pain syndromes and vulvodynia, suggesting shared mechanisms. Despite this progress, the identification of preclinical vulnerability factors and outcome predictors has been slow. To overcome current obstacles, the creation of consortia and the generation of standardised multisite repositories for brain imaging and metadata from multisite studies are required.","The effects of alcohol pricing policies on consumption, health, social and economic outcomes, and health inequality in Australia: a protocol of an epidemiological modelling study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175201,BMJ open,2019 06 08,"Alcohol use and misuse are associated with substantial health and social issues in Australia and internationally.

Multiple outbreaks of salmonellosis caused by Salmonella Heidelberg resulted from the same poultry processor, which infected 634 people during 2013-2014. The hospitalization and invasive illness rates were 38% and 15%, respectively. We hypothesized that the outbreak strains of Salmonella Heidelberg had enhanced stress tolerance and virulence capabilities. We sourced nine food isolates collected during the outbreak investigation and three reference isolates to assess their tolerance to heat and sanitizers, ability to attach to abiotic surfaces, and invasiveness in vitro. We performed RNA-sequencing on three isolates (two outbreak-associated isolates and a reference Salmonella Heidelberg strain) with varying heat tolerance to gain insight into the mechanism behind the isolates' enhanced heat tolerance. We also performed genomic analyses to determine the genetic relationships within the outbreak. Ultimately, we determined that (i) six Salmonella Heidelberg isolates associated with the foodborne outbreak had enhanced heat tolerance, (ii) one outbreak isolate with enhanced heat tolerance also had enhanced biofilm-forming ability under stressful conditions, (iii) exposure to heat stress increased expression of Salmonella Heidelberg multidrug efflux and virulence genes, and (iv) outbreak-associated isolates are likely transcriptionally primed to better survive processing stresses and potentially to cause illness.IMPORTANCE This study provides a deep analysis of the intrinsic stress tolerance and virulence capabilities of Salmonella Heidelberg that may have contributed to the length and severity of a recent salmonellosis outbreak. Additionally, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic response of S. enterica strains to heat stress conditions and compares baseline stationary phase gene expression among outbreak and non-outbreak-associated Salmonella Heidelberg isolates. This data can be used in assay development to screen isolates for stress tolerance and subsequent survival. This study adds to our understanding of the strains associated with the outbreak and informs ongoing regulatory discussions on Salmonella in poultry."

A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: ABCB4 (MDR3) rs2302387 and ABCB11 (BSEP) rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (P<0.05) and were associated with mean ≥ Grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25mcg/kg, 6hr/infusion, qdx7, every 28 days; P<0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, NTCP, OST mean α/β) in several cell lines (Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)) and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (P<0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited CDCA- and GW4046-induced FXR-GAL4 luciferase reporter activity (P<0.001). Mithramycin promoted GCDC-induced cytotoxicity in ABCB11 (-/-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (P<0.01). Mithramycin is an FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a mechanism of hepatotoxicity in which an FXR inhibitor causes deregulation of bile homeostasis in liver, which is currently the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin (NCT01624090).",Inhibition of Heat shock protein 90 suppresses Twist1 transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175180,Molecular pharmacology,2019 06 08,"Molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in oncogenic signaling pathways including epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance. The molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of HSP90 in EMT are still under investigation. In this study, we identified a previously unrecognized role of HSP90 in cooperating with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to regulate Twist1 transcription in cancer cells. HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17 demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), suppressed Twist1 mRNA expression and promoter activity in epithelial ovarian cancer, renal clear cell cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines. The interactions between HSP90 and transcription factors regulate Twist1 expression. Their interactions were visualized in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues using proximity ligation assays. Our findings reveal that HSP90 promotes the binding of STAT3 to Twist1 promoter, leading to the transcription of Twist1. The inhibition of HSP90 downregulates STAT3 activity and Twist1 transcription, thereby suppressing EMT and potentially inhibiting tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance in different types of cancers. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Our study provides new evidence that HSP90 promotes EMT through enhancing TWIST1 transcription, which can be suppressed by HSP90 inhibitor. HSP90 inhibitor inhibits EMT, thus potentially slowing down tumor growth, invasion, dissemination, metastasis, and drug resistance. These findings will hopefully pave the way for new therapeutic opportunities to target EMT and metastasis using HSP90 inhibitors.",Next stop: Perivasculature!

During inflammation, ILC2 numbers are increased in the lung. However, the mechanisms controlling ILC2 trafficking and motility within inflamed lungs remain unclear and are crucial for understanding ILC2 function in pulmonary immunity. Using several approaches, including lung intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that pulmonary ILC2s are highly dynamic, exhibit amoeboid-like movement, and aggregate in the lung peribronchial and perivascular spaces. They express distinct chemokine receptors, including CCR8, and actively home to CCL8 deposits located around the airway epithelium. Within lung tissue, ILC2s were particularly motile in extracellular matrix-enriched regions. We show that collagen-I drives ILC2 to markedly change their morphology by remodeling their actin cytoskeleton to promote environmental exploration critical for regulating eosinophilic inflammation. Our study provides previously unappreciated insights into ILC2 migratory patterns during inflammation and highlights the importance of environmental guidance cues in the lung in controlling ILC2 dynamics.",Interleukin-17 receptor D constitutes an alternative receptor for interleukin-17A important in psoriasis-like skin inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175175,Science immunology,2019 06 08,"T helper 17 (TH17) cells and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) produced by them are critical in autoinflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis. IL-17A has been shown to signal through IL-17 receptor A/IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) complex to drive inflammatory responses. However, in a psoriasis model, we found that Il17rc deficiency did not completely ameliorate the disease, suggesting another receptor. In search for another IL-17A-interacting receptor, we found that IL-17RD directly bound IL-17A but not IL-17F or IL-17A/F heterodimer and formed a heterodimer with IL-17RA. IL-17A-, but not IL-17F- or IL-17A/F-, mediated gene expression was defective in Il17rd-deficient keratinocytes. Il17rd deficiency in nonhemopoietic cells attenuated imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Although IL-17RC and IL-17RD differentially activated IL-17A-dependent signaling and gene expression, their compound mutation led to complete deficits in keratinocytes. IL-23 was found induced by IL-17A in keratinocytes, dependent on both IL-17RC and IL-17RD, suggesting feed-forward regulation of IL-23/IL-17 axis in psoriasis. Together, IL-17RD constitutes a second functional receptor for IL-17A and, together with IL-17RC, mediates the proinflammatory gene expression downstream of IL-17A.",AtTRAPPC11/ROG2: A Role for TRAPPs in Maintenance of the Plant trans-Golgi Network/Early Endosome Organization and Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175171,The Plant cell,2019 06 08,"The dynamic trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) facilitates cargo sorting and trafficking and plays a vital role in plant development and environmental response. Transport protein particles (TRAPPs) are multi-protein complexes acting as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and possibly as tethers, regulating intracellular trafficking. TRAPPs are essential in all eukaryotic cells and are implicated in a number of human diseases. It has been proposed that they also play crucial roles in plants; however, our current knowledge about the structure and function of plant TRAPPs is very limited. We identified and characterized AtTRAPPC11/Response to Oligogalacturonide-2 (AtTRAPPC11/ROG2), a TGN/EE-associated, evolutionarily conserved TRAPP protein in Arabidopsis. AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 regulates TGN integrity, as evidenced by altered TGN/EE association of several residents, including SYP61, and altered TGN vesicle morphology in attrappc11/rog2 mutants. Further, endocytic traffic and BFA body formation are perturbed in attrappc11/rog2, suggesting a role of AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 in regulation of endosomal function. Proteomic analysis showed that AtTRAPPC11/ROG2 defines a hitherto uncharacterized TRAPPIII complex in plants. In addition, attrappc11/rog2 mutants are hypersensitive to salinity, indicating an undescribed role of TRAPPs in stress responses. Overall, our study illustrates the plasticity of the endomembrane system through TRAPP protein functions and opens new avenues exploring this dynamic network.",New insights into minor splicing - A transcriptomic analysis of cells derived from TALS patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175170,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 08,"Minor intron splicing plays a central role in human embryonic development and survival. Indeed, biallelic mutations in RNU4ATAC, transcribed into the minor spliceosomal U4atac snRNA, are responsible for three rare autosomal recessive multi-malformation disorders named Taybi-Linder (TALS/MOPD1), Roifman (RFMN) and Lowry-Wood (LWS) syndromes, which associate numerous overlapping signs of varying severity. Although RNA-seq experiments have been conducted on a few RFMN patient cells, none have been performed in TALS, and more generally no in-depth transcriptomic analysis of the ~700 human genes containing a minor (U12-type) intron had been published as yet. We thus sequenced RNA from cells derived from five skin, three amniotic fluid and one blood biosamples obtained from seven unrelated TALS cases and from age- and sex-matched controls. This allowed us to describe for the first time the mRNA expression and splicing profile of genes containing U12-type introns, in the context of a functional minor spliceosome. Concerning RNU4ATAC-mutated patients, we show that as expected, they display distinct U12-type intron splicing profiles compared to controls, but that rather unexpectedly mRNA expression levels are mostly unchanged. Furthermore, although U12-type intron mis-splicing concerns most of the expressed U12 genes, the level of U12-type intron retention is surprisingly low in fibroblasts and amniocytes, and much more pronounced in blood cells. Interestingly, we found several occurrences of introns that can be spliced using either U2, U12 or a combination of both types of splice site consensus sequences, with a shift towards splicing using preferentially U2 sites in TALS patients' cells compared to controls.",Inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid: independent prognostic biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175169,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2019 06 08,"Inflammation is a key pathological hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which seems to be linked to the disease progression.

It also spurred numerous cellular mechanistic studies laying the foundations for how insulin regulates glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells. Here we reflect on the importance of the GLUT4 discovery and chronicle additional key findings made in the past 30 years. That exocytosis of a multi-spanning membrane protein regulates cellular glucose transport illuminated a novel adaptation of the secretory pathway, which is to transiently modulate the protein composition of the cellular plasma membrane. GLUT4 controls glucose transport into fat and muscle tissues in response to insulin and also into muscle during exercise. Thus, investigation of regulated GLUT4 trafficking provides a major means by which to map the essential signalling components that transmit the effects of insulin and exercise. Manipulation of the expression of GLUT4 or GLUT4-regulating molecules in mice has revealed the impact of glucose uptake on whole body metabolism. Remaining gaps in our understanding of GLUT4 function and regulation are highlighted here, along with opportunities for future discoveries and for the development of therapeutic approaches to manage metabolic disease.",Hyaluronidase-4 is produced by mast cells and can cleave serglycin chondroitin sulfate chains into lower molecular weight forms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175155,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 08,"Mast cells represent a heterogeneous cell population that, are well known for the production of heparin and the release of histamine upon activation. Serglycin is a proteoglycan that within mast cell α-granules is predominantly decorated with the glycosaminoglycans heparin or chondroitin sulfate (CS) and has a known role in granule homeostasis. Heparanase is a heparin degrading enzyme, is present within the α-granules, and contributes to granule homeostasis, but an equivalent CS degrading enzyme has not previously been reported. In this study, using several approaches, including epitope-specific antibodies, immunohistochemistry, and EM analyses, we demonstrate that human HMC-1 mast cells produce the CS degrading enzymes hyaluronidase-1 (HYAL1) and HYAL4. We observed that treating the two model CS proteoglycans aggrecan and serglycin with HYAL1 and HYAL4 in vitro cleaves the CS chains into lower molecular weight forms with non-reducing end oligosaccharide structures similar to CS stub neoepitopes generated after digestion with the bacterial lyase chondroitinase ABC. We found that these structures are associated with both the CS linkage region and with structures more distally toward the non-reducing end of the CS chain. Furthermore, we noted that HYAL4 cleaves CS chains into lower molecular weight forms that range in length from tetra- to dodecasaccharides. These results provide first evidence that mast cells produce HYAL4 and that this enzyme may play a specific role in maintaining α-granule homeostasis in these cells by cleaving CS glycosaminoglycan chains attached to serglycin.",Dissecting the Mechanisms of Cell Division.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175154,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 08,"Cell division is a highly regulated and carefully orchestrated process. Understanding the mechanisms that promote proper cell division is an important step toward unraveling important questions in cell biology and human health. Early studies seeking to dissect the mechanisms of cell division used classical genetics approaches to identify genes involved in mitosis and deployed biochemical approaches to isolate and identify proteins critical for cell division. These studies underscored that post-translational modifications and cyclin-kinase complexes play roles at the heart of the cell division program. Modern approaches to examining the mechanisms of cell division, including the use of high-throughput methods to study the effects of RNAi, cDNA, and chemical libraries, have evolved to encompass a larger biological and chemical space. Here, we outline some of the classical studies that established a foundation for the field and provide an overview of recent approaches that have advanced the study of cell division.",Kinetics of Xist-induced gene silencing can be predicted from combinations of epigenetic and genomic features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175153,Genome research,2019 06 08,"To initiate X Chromosome inactivation (XCI), the long noncoding RNA Xist mediates chromosome-wide gene silencing of one X Chromosome in female mammals to equalize gene dosage between the sexes. The efficiency of gene silencing is highly variable across genes, with some genes even escaping XCI in somatic cells. A gene's susceptibility to Xist-mediated silencing appears to be determined by a complex interplay of epigenetic and genomic features; however, the underlying rules remain poorly understood. We have quantified chromosome-wide gene silencing kinetics at the level of the nascent transcriptome using allele-specific Precision nuclear Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). We have developed a Random Forest machine learning model that can predict the measured silencing dynamics based on a large set of epigenetic and genomic features and tested its predictive power experimentally. The genomic distance to the Xist locus, followed by gene density and distance to LINE elements are the prime determinants of the speed of gene silencing. Moreover, we find two distinct gene classes associated with different silencing pathways: a class that requires Xist repeat A for silencing, which is known to activate the SPEN-pathway and a second class where genes are pre-marked by Polycomb complexes and tend to rely on the B repeat in Xist for silencing, known to recruit polycomb complexes during XCI. Moreover, a series of features associated with active transcriptional elongation and chromatin 3D structure are enriched at rapidly silenced genes. Our machine learning approach can thus uncover the complex combinatorial rules underlying gene silencing during X inactivation.",Microtubule minus-end regulation at a glance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175152,Journal of cell science,2019 06 08,"Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments essential for numerous aspects of cell physiology. They are polarized polymeric tubes with a fast growing plus end and a slow growing minus end. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we review the current knowledge on the dynamics and organization of microtubule minus ends. Several factors, including the γ-tubulin ring complex, CAMSAP/Patronin, ASPM/Asp, SPIRAL2 (in plants) and the KANSL complex recognize microtubule minus ends and regulate their nucleation, stability and interactions with partners, such as microtubule severing enzymes, microtubule depolymerases and protein scaffolds. Together with minus-end-directed motors, these microtubule minus-end targeting proteins (-TIPs) also control the formation of microtubule-organizing centers, such as centrosomes and spindle poles, and mediate microtubule attachment to cellular membrane structures, including the cell cortex, Golgi complex and the cell nucleus. Structural and functional studies are starting to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which dynamic -TIP networks control microtubule minus ends.",Transport dynamics of complex fluids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175151,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 08,"Thermal motion in complex fluids is a complicated stochastic process but ubiquitously exhibits initial ballistic, intermediate subdiffusive, and long-time diffusive motion, unless interrupted. Despite its relevance to numerous dynamical processes of interest in modern science, a unified, quantitative understanding of thermal motion in complex fluids remains a challenging problem. Here, we present a transport equation and its solutions, which yield a unified quantitative explanation of the mean-square displacement (MSD), the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP), and the displacement distribution of complex fluids. In our approach, the environment-coupled diffusion kernel and its time correlation function (TCF) are the essential quantities that determine transport dynamics and characterize mobility fluctuation of complex fluids; their time profiles are directly extractable from a model-free analysis of the MSD and NGP or, with greater computational expense, from the two-point and four-point velocity autocorrelation functions. We construct a general, explicit model of the diffusion kernel, comprising one unbound-mode and multiple bound-mode components, which provides an excellent approximate description of transport dynamics of various complex fluidic systems such as supercooled water, colloidal beads diffusing on lipid tubes, and dense hard disk fluid. We also introduce the concepts of intrinsic disorder and extrinsic disorder that have distinct effects on transport dynamics and different dependencies on temperature and density.

As such, this group of enzymes plays an important role in determining the glucosinolate composition of Brassicaceae species, including Arabidopsis thaliana Based on protein structure modelling of MAM1 from A. thaliana and analysis of 57 MAM sequences from Brassicaceae species, we identified four polymorphic residues likely to interact with the 2-oxo acid substrate. Through site-directed mutagenesis, the natural variation in these residues and the effect on product composition were investigated. Fifteen MAM1 variants as well as the native MAM1 and MAM3 from A. thaliana were characterised by heterologous expression of the glucosinolate chain elongation pathway in Escherichia coli Detected products derived from leucine, methionine or phenylalanine were elongated with up to six methylene groups. Product profile and accumulation were changed in fourteen of the variants, demonstrating the relevance of the identified residues. The majority of the single amino acid substitutions decreased the length of methionine-derived products, while approximately half of the substitutions increased the phenylalanine-derived products. Combining two substitutions enabled the MAM1 variant to increase the number of elongation rounds of methionine from three to four. Notably, characterisation of the native MAMs indicated that MAM1 and not MAM3 is responsible for homophenylalanine production. This hypothesis was confirmed by glucosinolate analysis in mam1 and mam3 mutants of A. thaliana.",FEZF1-AS1: A novel vital oncogenic lncRNA in multiple human malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175144,Bioscience reports,2019 06 08,"Long noncoding RNAs(LncRNAs) refer to the RNA with a length of > 200 nucleotides, which lack or have no open reading coding frame and have higher tissue and organ specificity compared with the protein coding genes.

During embryogenesis it arises from the proepicardium (PE), a cell cluster that appears in the dorsal pericardium (DP) close to the venous pole of the heart. Little is known about how the PE emerges from the pericardial mesothelium. Using the zebrafish model and a combination of genetic tools, pharmacological agents and quantitative in vivo imaging, we reveal that a coordinated collective movement of DP cells drives PE formation. We found that BMP signaling and the actomyosin cytoskeleton promote constriction of the DP, which enabled PE cells to extrude apically. We provide evidence that cell extrusion, which has been described in the elimination of unfit cells from epithelia and the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells, is also a mechanism for PE cells to exit an organized mesothelium and fulfil the developmental fate to form a new tissue layer, the epicardium.","Genetic ablation of the cystine transporter xCT in PDAC cells inhibits mTORC1, growth, survival and tumor formation via nutrient and oxidative stresses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175120,Cancer research,2019 06 08,"Although chemoresistance remains a primary challenge in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), exploiting oxidative stress might offer novel therapeutic clues. Here we explored the potential of targeting cystine/glutamate exchanger (SLC7A11/xCT), which contributes to the maintenance of intracellular glutathione (GSH). Genomic disruption of xCT via CRISPR-Cas9 was achieved in two PDAC cell lines, MiaPaCa-2 and Capan-2, and xCT-KO clones were cultivated in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Although several cystine/cysteine transporters have been identified, our findings demonstrate that, in vitro, xCT plays the major role in intracellular cysteine balance and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. As a consequence, both xCT-KO cell lines exhibited amino acid stress with activation of GCN2 and subsequent induction of ATF4, inhibition of mTORC1, proliferation arrest, and cell death. Tumor xenograft growth was delayed but not suppressed in xCT-KO cells, which indicated both the key role of xCT and also the presence of additional mechanisms for cysteine homeostasis in vivo. Moreover, rapid depletion of intracellular GSH in xCT-KO cells led to accumulation of lipid peroxides and cell swelling. These two hallmarks of ferroptotic cell death were prevented by vitamin E or iron chelation. Finally, in vitro pharmacological inhibition of xCT by low concentrations of erastin phenocopied xCT-KO and potentiated the cytotoxic effects of both gemcitabine and cisplatin in PDAC cell lines. In conclusion, our findings strongly support that inhibition of xCT, by its dual induction of nutritional and oxidative cellular stresses, has great potential as an anticancer strategy.",An ERG enhancer-based reporter identifies leukemia cells with elevated leukemogenic potential driven by ERG-USP9X feed-forward regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175119,Cancer research,2019 06 08,"Acute leukemia is a rapidly progressing blood cancer with low survival rates. Unfavorable prognosis is attributed to insufficiently characterized subpopulations of Leukemia Stem Cells (LSC) that drive chemoresistance and leukemia relapse. Here we utilized a genetic reporter which assesses stemness to enrich and functionally characterize LSC. We observed heterogeneous activity of the ERG+85 enhancer-based fluorescent reporter in human leukemias. Cells with high reporter activity (tagBFPHigh) exhibited elevated expression of stemness and chemoresistance genes and demonstrated increased clonogenicity and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy as compared to their tagBFPNeg counterparts. The tagBFPHigh fraction was capable of regenerating the original cellular heterogeneity and demonstrated increased invasive ability. Moreover, the tagBFPHigh fraction was enriched for leukemia initiating cells in a xenograft assay. We identified the ubiquitin hydrolase USP9X as a novel ERG transcriptional target that sustains ERG+85 positive cells by controlling ERG ubiquitination. Therapeutic targeting of USP9X led to preferential inhibition of the ERG-dependent leukemias. Collectively, these results characterize human leukemia cell functional heterogeneity and suggest that targeting ERG via USP9X inhibition may be a potential treatment strategy in patients with leukemia.",Diagnostic dilemma of ocular lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175115,BMJ case reports,2019 06 08,"We report a very unusual presentation of primary intraocular lymphoma masquerading as anterior uveitis with atypical symptoms.

Recently, we demonstrated that AMPK is necessary for AICAR, contraction and exercise to enhance muscle and whole-body insulin sensitivity in mice. Correlative observations from both human and rodent skeletal muscle suggest that regulation of the phosphorylation status of TBC1D4 may relay this insulin sensitization. However, the necessity of TBC1D4 for this phenomenon has not been proven. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if TBC1D4 is necessary for enhancing muscle insulin sensitivity in response to AICAR and contraction. We found that immediately following contraction and AICAR stimulation, phosphorylation of AMPKα-Thr172 and downstream targets were increased similarly in glycolytic skeletal muscle from wild-type and TBC1D4-deficient mice. In contrast, 3 h after contraction or 6 h after AICAR stimulation, enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was evident in muscle from wild-type mice only. The enhanced insulin sensitivity in muscle from wild-type mice was associated with improved insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of TBC1D4 (Thr649 and Ser711) but not of TBC1D1. These results provide genetic evidence linking signaling through TBC1D4 to enhanced muscle insulin sensitivity following activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK.",Design and evaluation of an external control arm using prior clinical trials and real-world data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175098,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 06 08,The use of existing data (real world data or prior trials) to design and analyze clinical studies has the potential to accelerate drug development processes and can contribute to rigorous examination of new treatments.,Clinical genomic sequencing of pediatric and adult osteosarcoma reveals distinct molecular subsets with potentially targetable alterations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175097,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 06 08,"While multimodal chemotherapy has improved outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma (OS), the prognosis for patients who present with metastatic and/or recurrent disease remains poor.

In Egypt, we established different care programs to combat liver diseases including schistosomiasis and viral hepatitides. A lot of research work addressing liver diseases in Egypt have been published with special focus on these two major fields. Other liver disease seems to be neglected although present and contributing to the liver disease burden in Egypt. In this report we reviewed the available evidence published from Egypt and elucidate areas of weakness and future research needs. Our search for Egyptian liver disease evidence retrieved 4683 articles, 67% of them were relevant to the topic. Out of the relevant articles; 1646/3265 (50.4%) were discussing clinical science, 1131 (34.7%) were discussing basic science and 488 (14.9%) were discussing both basic and clinical sciences. Cairo university (16.8%, n = 513) and Mansoura university (9.3%, n = 285) had the largest number of publications related to liver disease in Egypt respectively. The most commonly reported diseases were hepatitis C in 719/3361 articles (21.4%), parasitic liver infestations in 663 articles (19.7%), hepatocellular carcinoma in 544 articles (16.2%), liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in 537 articles (16%), and drug induced liver injury in 516 articles (15.4%). Most of the reviewed articles (36%) were discussing treatment of chronic liver diseases (n = 1201) followed by diagnostics (28%, n = 940), pathogenesis and pathophysiology (21%, n = 706). This review will direct attention to areas with less research like hepatitis B related liver disease, HIV/HCV co-infections, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to encourage future research in these topics. In conclusion; our results ring a bell inviting the development of a roadmap for liver research in Egypt targeting to put future policies to cover areas of weakness in liver research with an ultimate goal of tackling liver disease and its overwhelming socioeconomic burden in our developing country."

Differentially labelling of donor and recipient strains with distinct fluorescent proteins allowed the visualization of plasmid transfer in living mycelium. In nearly all observed matings, plasmid transfer occurred when donor and recipient hyphae made intimate contact at the lateral walls. Plasmid transfer does not involve a complete fusion of donor and recipient hyphae, but depends on a pore formed by the FtsK-like DNA translocase TraB. Following the initial transfer at the contact site of donor and recipient, the plasmids spread within the recipient mycelium by invading neighboring compartments, separated by cross walls. Intra-mycelial plasmid spreading depends on a septal cross wall localized multi-protein DNA translocation apparatus consisting of TraB and several Spd proteins and is abolished in a spd mutant. The ability to spread within the recipient mycelium is a crucial adaptation to the mycelial life style of Streptomyces, potentiating the efficiency of plasmid transfer.",Redo Aortic Valve Replacement Following Bio-Bentall's Procedure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175018,"Heart, lung & circulation",2019 06 08,"Structural valve degeneration is a known sequel of aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves, not infrequently leading to redo valve replacement.

Neurology,2019 06 08,"1·8 billion people of diverse ethnicities and cultures live in the Western Pacific Region. The increasing longevity of populations in this region is a major contributor to the exponential increase in Parkinson's disease prevalence worldwide. Differences exist between Parkinson's disease in the Western Pacific Region and in Europe and North America that might provide important insights into our understanding of the disease and approaches to management. For example, some genetic factors (such as LRRK2 mutations or variants) differ, environmental exposures might play differential roles in modulating the risk of Parkinson's disease, and fewer dyskinesias are reported, with some differences in the profile of non-motor symptoms and comorbidities. Gaps in awareness of the disease and inequitable access to treatments pose challenges. Further improvements in infrastructure, clinical governance, and services, and concerted collaborative efforts in training and research, including greater representation of the Western Pacific Region in clinical trials, will improve care of patients with Parkinson's disease in this region and beyond.","Pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of medication overuse headache.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174999,The Lancet.

We verified the mRNA expression levels of drug-metabolizing enzyme-related genes and the leakage of enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH, and γ-GTP) as indicators of cell survival. As a result, the patterns of target mRNA expression in fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes were very similar during the culture period between culture methods. mRNA expression levels were highly maintained at day 28 using the 3D spheroid and co-culture methods, demonstrating that these methods are useful for maintenance of liver function. Leakage of AST and ALT was higher at day 3 but decreased at day 14. LDH was not detected, suggesting that the cell viability was also maintained during the culture period. Furthermore, the functional differences between fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes were not clearly detected. The co-culture method was useful for long-term culture not requiring 3D structure, and the 3D spheroid culture method was effective as well. With these techniques, cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes are expected to exhibit smaller individual differences and high reproducibility.",Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1a4-mediated heterogeneous distribution of sulforhodamine-101 in rat hepatic lobules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174976,Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019 06 08,"It has been known that organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatps) involve hepatic transports several organic anionic compounds and drugs. This study aimed to investigate sulforhodamine-101 (SR-101) distribution in the rat liver, determine the molecules responsible for the distribution, and delineate the manner of distribution. After intravenous SR-101 administration, its distribution in frozen rat hepatic sections was examined. SR-101-derived signals were detected in regions around the hepatic central vein (CV), where immunohistochemistry (IHC) indicated high Oatp1a4 expression. The signals decreased with treatment by digoxin, a specific substrate for Oatp1a4. In vitro studies using isolated rat hepatocytes and rat Oatp1a4-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes have suggested that SR-101 is an Oatp1a4 substrate and is taken up into rat hepatocytes mainly via Oatp1a4. Therefore, results suggested SR-101 zonation because of Oatp1a4 involvement and that Oatp1a4 function is dominant in the region around the hepatic CV in rat hepatic lobules.",Neural Dedifferentiation in the Aging Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174975,Trends in cognitive sciences,2019 06 08,"Many cognitive abilities decline with age even in the absence of detectable pathology. Recent evidence indicates that age-related neural dedifferentiation, operationalized in terms of neural selectivity, may contribute to this decline. We review here work exploring the relationship between neural dedifferentiation, cognition, and age. Compelling evidence for age effects on neural selectivity comes from both non-human animal and human research. However, current data suggest that age does not moderate the observed relationships between neural dedifferentiation and cognitive performance. We propose that functionally significant variance in measures of neural dedifferentiation reflects both age-dependent and age-independent factors. We further propose that the effects of age on neural dedifferentiation do not exclusively reflect detrimental consequences of aging.",Arterial vs venous lactate: Correlation and predictive value of mortality of patients with sepsis during early resuscitation phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174974,Journal of critical care,2019 06 08,To compare the lactate concentrations obtained from venous to those obtained from arterial blood in predicting hospital mortality of patients with sepsis and septic shock.

This study describes the demographic profile and the pathology of trauma related to burn fatalities as seen at the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory (PTA MLL), a large urban medico-legal mortuary over a 5-year period from January 2011 to December 2015. Mortuary admission records and autopsy reports were used to gather information on demographics, circumstances of injury, apparent manner and cause of death, pathology of burns, toxicology and histology reports and identification of the decedents. RESULTS: Of the 9558 unnatural deaths admitted to the PTA MLL during this time period, 291 (3.0%) of the fatalities met the inclusion criteria. The male:female ratio was 2.9:1. Most fatalities occurred between the ages of 0-4 years. One hundred and forty-two (142) decedents were charred beyond recognition. Identification was confirmed in 134 (94.4%) of the charred remains. In 208 (69.8%) of the cases the manner of death was deemed to be accidental, 23 (7.9%) were homicidal and 11 (3.8%) were suicides. Two hundred and fifty-five (87.4%) of the fatalities were as a result of open flames/fires. Shack fires were responsible for 105 (36%) of all fatalities. In 32 (11.0%) cases of open flame/fire fatalities where death occurred at the scene of injury, more than one fatality was reported per incident. In 122 (79.2%) of scene fatalities, soot deposition was noted in the upper and lower airways. Forty-five (32.8%) of hospital fatalities occurred within 24 h of admission. The most common complications in hospital fatalities were from the respiratory system. The mean blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) was 0.09 g/100 ml. The mean carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations (COHb) was 19.9%. All available cyanide results were negative. CONCLUSION: The study is the first of its kind in South Africa to generate bimodal descriptive statistics for burn fatalities. Approximately 3% of unnatural deaths at the PTA-MLL were due to burns, occurring at a rate of ±1 death per week. The data provides a platform for funding, collaborative research, planning and development of public health programs.",The effects of relative cycling intensity on saddle pressure indexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174969,Journal of science and medicine in sport,2019 06 08,To compare pressure load and distribution in various saddle zones through a range of workloads in order to provide clinicians and bike fitters with a better understanding of how to optimise saddle positioning.,Feasibility of using tapping torque during lumbar pedicle screw insertion to predict screw fixation strength.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174968,Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,2019 06 08,"Rigid pedicle screw fixation is mandatory for achieving successful spinal fusion; however, there is no reliable method predicting screw fixation before screw insertion.

OCC is a major public health problem in the Indian subcontinent, where it ranks among the top three cancer types in both incidence and mortality. Major risk factors are the use of tobacco, betel quid and alcohol consumption. OCC is a heterogeneous group of multiple histologies that affects multiple subsites. The oral cavity includes the lips, buccal mucosa, teeth, gingiva, anterior two-thirds of the tongue, floor of the mouth and hard palate. OCC is defined as cancer of lips, mouth and tongue as defined by the International Classification of Diseases coding scheme. The epidemiology, aetio-pathogenesis and treatment philosophy are similar within this group. Although salivary gland malignancies, sarcomas, mucosal melanomas and lymphomas can also arise within the oral cavity, this review will focus on squamous cell cancer, which is the predominant histology in OCC.

We also highlight the unique regional challenges that countries in the East face; citing India as an example, we elaborate on the opportunities and scope for improvement in the management of OCC.",A unidirectional porous beta-tricalcium phosphate material (Affinos®) for reconstruction of bony defects after excision of fibular bone for spinal surgery graft.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174946,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 06 08,"The aim of this study was to elucidate the bone regeneration-inducing capability of Affinos®, a newly developed, high-porosity unidirectional porous β-TCP artificial bone. We compared the ability of Affinos® and OSferion®, a commercially available β-TCP product, to induce bone regeneration following implantation into bony defects left after fibula harvesting for spinal fusion surgery. Study subjects underwent surgery to harvest non-vascularized fibula grafts for spinal fusion surgery and were implanted with either Affinos® (19 patients) or OSferion® (15 patients, control group) at the defect site. The minimal and mean follow up periods were 6 and 11 months after surgery, respectively. X-rays of the lower leg taken 1-2 weeks after surgery and at the final follow-up visit were used to evaluate fibular-β-TCP continuity and fibula defect filling ratio. There was no significant difference in radiographic continuity in the fibula between the two groups. The fibula defect filling ratio for the Affinos® group decreased from 0.94 ± 0.17 at 1-2 weeks to 0.77 ± 0.14 at 10 months. For the OSferion® control group, the fibula defect filling ratio decreased from 0.94 ± 0.14 at 1-2 weeks to 0.52 ± 0.27 at final follow-up. The Affinos® group showed a significantly higher fibula defect filling ratio compared to that for the OSferion® group (p = 0.003).

We used RNA interference to silence Bcl-2 gene of endometrial stromal cells, and then Cell Counting Kit(CCK-8), cell scratch repair test, and Annexin V-APC/propidium iodide (PI) staining were performed to detect the cell viability, migration ability and apoptotic rate. The results of the present study revealed that the expression of Bcl-2 was evidently higher than that in control group. After silencing the Bcl-2 gene, the cytoactive and migration ability of endometrial stromal cells of adenomyosis decreased, and the apoptotic rate increased.

The majority of GCs are caused by infectious agents, including the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Furthermore, inappropriate repair of DNA damage can also result in genomic instability, which has shown to be a key factor in carcinogenesis of different regions including gastric region. Present study was designed to explore the association between base excision repair pathway genes, PARP1 and APEX1 and gastric pathology and H. pylori infection. Two hundred gastric cancer tissue samples (114 H. pylori positive and 86 H. pylori negative) and adjacent uninvolved area taken as controls was used for expression analysis of BER pathway genes at mRNA level and protein levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively. Oxidative stress and DNA damage was also determined by measuring the level of antioxidant enzymes and comet assay respectively. Significant upregulation in PARP1 (p < 0.001) and APEX1 (p < 0.02) was observed in GC tissue samples compared to controls and this upregulation was more pronounced in H. pylori positive cases (HPGC) (PARP1, p < 0.02: APEX1, p < 0.04) than H. pylori negative cases (HNGC). Upregulation of BER pathway genes in HPGC was found correlated with smoking status (p < 0.0001), T stage (p < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.03). Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of BER pathway genes was found correlated with a number of clinicopathological characteristics such as tumor type (p < 0.03), tumor size (p < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.01). Expression levels of APEX1 and PARP1 gene also correlated with increased oxidative burden (p < 0.0001) and DNA damage (p < 0.001) in GC patients. Survival analysis showed that upregulation of PARP1 gene was associated with poor overall survival outcome of gastric cancer patients (HR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.10-3.76; p < 0.02). Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis showed the upregulated PARP1 gene (HR = 5.03; 95%CI (2.22-11.35); p = 0.0001), positive smoking status (HR = 3.58; 95%CI (1.67-7.65); p = 0.001), positive status for H pylori infection (HR = 4.38; 95%CI (1.82-10.56); p = 0.001) and advance N-stage (HR = 5.29; 95%CI (2.28-12.24); p = 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for gastric cancer and may serve as a valuable biomarker for the diagnosis and progression of GC and can be helpful in developing individualized treatment strategies for treating GC.",Optimization of database for identification need of unknown spent nuclear fuel samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174924,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 06 08,"Recent years, the work of nuclear forensics has been greatly promoted in many aspects, and an important work is the establishment and application of nuclear forensic database. For now, this research is mainly based on uranium ore, because there is plenty of uranium ore information that is open and is easy to form database available for attribution. However, as the potential threat of spent nuclear fuel gets more and more attention, the number of researches on the identification of spent nuclear fuel via database is increasing. Since there is no public spent nuclear fuel database that is proper for attribution, such kind of work is mainly on methodology study. This paper focuses on the use of database for the identification of spent nuclear fuel. A database is first constructed with numerical simulation results and is used to identify samples both from simulation and experimental measurements to study the availability and applicability. Then samples from real database are used to optimize the database constructed with simulation result to better meet the need of real nuclear forensics scenarios.",Assessment of the Superharmonic Response of Microbubble Contrast Agents for Acoustic Angiography as a Function of Microbubble Parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174922,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 06 08,"Acoustic angiography is a superharmonic contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging technique that enables 3-D high-resolution microvascular visualization. This technique utilizes a dual-frequency imaging strategy, transmitting at a low frequency and receiving at a higher frequency, to detect high-frequency contrast agent signatures and separate them from tissue background. Prior studies have illustrated differences in microbubble scatter dependent on microbubble size and composition; however, most previously reported data have utilized a relatively narrow frequency bandwidth centered around the excitation frequency. To date, a comprehensive study of isolated microbubble superharmonic responses with a broadband dual-frequency system has not been performed. Here, the superharmonic signal production of 14 contrast agents with various gas cores, shell compositions, and bubble diameters at mechanical indices of 0.2 to 1.2 was evaluated using a transmit 4 MHz, receive 25 MHz configuration. Results indicate that perfluorocarbon cores or lipid shells with 18- or 20-carbon acyl chains produce more superharmonic signal than sulfur hexafluoride cores or lipid shells with 16-carbon acyl chains, respectively. As microbubble diameter increases from 1 to 4 µm, superharmonic generation decreases. In a comparison of two clinical agents, Definity and Optison, and one preclinical agent, Micromarker, Optison produced the least superharmonic signal. Overall, this work suggests that microbubbles around 1 μm in diameter with perfluorocarbon cores and longer-chained lipid shells perform best for superharmonic imaging at 4 MHz. Studies have found that microbubble superharmonic response follows trends different from those described in prior studies using a narrower frequency bandwidth centered around the excitation frequency. Future work will apply these results in vivo to optimize the sensitivity of acoustic angiography.",Clinical expert consensus document on the use of percutaneous left ventricular assist support devices during complex high-risk indicated PCI: Italian Society of Interventional Cardiology Working Group Endorsed by Spanish and Portuguese Interventional Cardiology Societies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174920,International journal of cardiology,2019 06 08,"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is establishing as the last remaining revascularization option in an increasing number of patients affected by complex coronary artery disease not suitable for surgery.

We describe a method that could simulate postoperative occlusion and direction of the donor tooth by using CAD and digital surgical templates, and evaluate the postoperative effect in five patients who had teeth autotransplanted. Computed tomographic data were imported into ProPlan CMF 3.0 software, the donor tooth was simulated to replace the recipient site according to the position of the occlusion and alveolar bone, and a digital template was designed to guide preparation of the socket. A computer-aided, rapid prototyped, tooth was used to match the socket and, finally, an occlusal template was designed to ensure that the donor tooth was in the simulated position. We compared the position of the tooth in the simulation with its postoperative position using ProPlan CMF 3.0 software. In this way it was possible to simulate and guide the donor tooth accurately to the recipient site. At six-month follow up all teeth had survived successfully. Given the efficiency and precision of placement and the success, we conclude that CAD can successfully help to simulate occlusion and direction in autotransplantation of teeth while simplifying the procedure.",Postoperative management in the Intensive Care Unit of head and neck surgery patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174894,Medicina intensiva,2019 06 08,"Patient care after major head and neck surgery has changed in recent years. Tumors are the most common reasons for this type of surgery, though it is also used to treat benign conditions. Recent advances in equipment and surgical techniques have improved the postoperative course in this field, allowing early recovery, less pain and infection, a shorter hospital stay, and even better aesthetic results. This is due to the use of minimally invasive techniques, which are gaining relevance. Such techniques allow complex procedures in the head and neck region, through natural orifices or small incisions, with minimal damage and sequelae for the patients. Despite these advances, however, the complexity of the treatment intervention requires multidisciplinary patient management, mostly in the Intensive Care Unit, in order to monitor the possible occurrence of complications. Potential risk factors include previous comorbidity, the type of surgery involved (e.g., bilateral cervical lymphadenectomy), multiple transfusions, and the appearance of early complications requiring repeat surgery. Despite the existence of several studies, there are no standardized protocols for the postoperative period in surgeries of this kind. This causes many specialists to resort to accelerated recovery protocols (ERAS: ""Enhanced Recovery After Surgery"") that have already been established in other surgical specialties.",Using video education to improve outcomes in heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174893,Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,2019 06 08,Heart Failure (HF) guidelines recommend HF self-care education.

Robotic approaches to retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (R-RPLND) have been proposed as an alternative to open surgery with few if any adverse events reported. We report the clinical course for five recent patients referred to our center for recurrences after R-RPLND, focusing on recurrence patterns, treatment burden, and treatment-related morbidity and mortality. The median time to recurrence after R-RPLND was 259d. The recurrence patterns after R-RPLND were aberrant from our past experience in managing recurrences after open RPLND. One man experienced an in-field recurrence located in close proximitry to an undivided lumbar vessel. Four patients had out-of-field recurrence in abnormal locations: pericolic space invading the sigmoid colon, peritoneal carcinomatosis with a perinephric mass, large-volume liver lesions with suprahilar disease extending into the retrocrural space, and lymph nodes in the celiac axis. The treatment burden was high: the five men were subjected to 12 different chemotherapy regimens and three underwent additional surgeries. Three patients developed significant cisplatin-induced toxicity. One patient died due to progression of testicular cancer after failing all chemotherapy and surgical options. PATIENT SUMMARY: We report our initial experience in managing patients with testicular cancer referred to our institution after robotic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). We found that the recurrences were highly variable and in unusual locations and were associated with a high treatment burden. We conclude that further investigation into the safety and long-term oncologic efficacy of robotic RPLND is necessary before widespread implementation.",A phase 1b dose escalation study of ipafricept (OMP54F28) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174889,Gynecologic oncology,2019 06 08,The WNT pathway is an important oncologic driver of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

We discuss the geomorphic character of Manot Cave on the background of other karst features of the region, in order to decipher the preferences of the humans who favored this cave over others. Tens of caves distributed over the study area demonstrate that phreatic and hypogene isolated voids and conduit segments are more abundant than vadose shafts, sinking stream caves and spring caves, although all these types are present. Most caves belong to old stages of landform development, prior to Plio-Pleistocene uplift and stream entrenchment. Manot Cave is a relict chamber cave, which corresponds to a plaeo-water table and the erosion plain above it. Subaerial denudation and slope processes have opened the cave to the surface during the mid-late Pleistocene. Manot Cave is compared with other caves in the region, demonstrating its unique character. It may have been selected due to the small entrance facing to the SW, and the large inner chamber which could be used for non-domestic purposes. This suggests a possible role of a unique behavioral and cultural suite of characters which influenced hominin preferences. The cave was used by hominins and animals until being closed again by colluvium and possibly collapse, ∼30 ka. Clastic, chemical, archaeozoological and anthropogenic accumulations reflect the various stages of cave development and gradual sealing of the entrance.","[Mental health of children in foster care, a literature review].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174867,L'Encephale,2019 06 08,"In France more than 140 000 children live in foster homes under the responsibility of the French Child Protection Agency. These children have lived in environments that cannot be good for their development and have been separated from their families which have to have consequences on their mental development. A literature review in France and abroad was made to identify the profiles of these children, their risk factors, and the mental disorders they can present. French child protection is handled by smaller territories, called Départements of which there are more than 90 and count around 1 000 000 people each. The number of foster children differ byDépartement, as do the placement types and meaning of the placement. More than half of these children have suffered maltreatment prior to placement. Comparing them to children of the same age, they present more internalizing and externalizing disorders, more addiction problems and suicidal behaviors. Protection factors have nonetheless been identified, such as early age of placement and placement stability. The main inhibitors of good health care are the absence of a common regulatory framework, source of organization difficulties, and the lack of collaboration between health and social services. French cohort studies using validated tools are necessary to precise and confirm these results.

Biplane videoradiography (BVR) has allowed investigators to study dynamic activities in the knee, hip, and shoulder joint; however, currently, BVR has not been utilized for the wrist joint because of the challenges associated with imaging multiple overlapping bones. Therefore, our aim was to develop a BVR procedure and to quantify its accuracy for evaluation of wrist kinematics. BVR was performed on six cadaveric forearms for one neutral static and six dynamic tasks, including flexion-extension, radial-ulnar deviation, circumduction, pronation, supination, and hammering. Optical motion capture (OMC) served as the gold standard for assessing accuracy. We propose a feedforward tracking methodology, which uses a combined model of metacarpals (second and third) for initialization of the third metacarpal (MC3). BVR-calculated kinematic parameters were found to be consistent with the OMC-calculated parameters, and the BVR/OMC agreement had submillimeter and sub-degree biases in tracking individual bones as well as the overall joint's rotation and translation. All dynamic tasks (except pronation task) showed a limit of agreement within 1.5° for overall rotation, and within 1.3 mm for overall translations. Pronation task had a 2.1° and 1.4 mm limit of agreement for rotation and translation measurement. The poorest precision was achieved in calculating the pronation-supination angle, and radial-ulnar and volar-dorsal translational components, although they were sub-degree and submillimeter.

Canonically, RB1 regulates cell cycle progression and represents the downstream target for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors that are in clinical use. However, newly discovered features of the RB1 pathway suggest new therapeutic strategies to counter resistance and improve precision medicine. These therapeutic strategies include deepening cell cycle exit with CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations, selectively targeting tumors that have lost RB1, and expanding therapeutic index by mitigating therapy-associated adverse effects. In addition, RB1 impacts immunological features of tumors and the microenvironment that can enhance sensitivity to immunotherapy. Lastly, RB1 specifies epigenetically determined cell lineage states that are disrupted during therapy resistance and could be re-installed through the direct use of epigenetic therapies.

We explored periprocedural safety and mortality in severe AS patients undergoing RA. Prospective anonymized clinical, echocardiographic, procedural and outcome data of patients undergoing RA PCI between January 2012 and July 2018 were retrospectively extracted from the institutional coronary database. Patients with severe AS undergoing RA PCI were 1:1 propensity matched with patients undergoing RA PCI in the absence of AS. Outcomes of interest were RA related periprocedural complications, 30-day and 1-year mortality. A prespecified subgroup analysis examined the influence of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on mortality following RA PCI. A total of 544 patients underwent RA PCI; 478 without AS and 66 with AS. Propensity matching yielded 35 matched pairs with improved balance in covariates of interest and no significant differences in baseline characteristics postmatching. In the matched cohort (n = 70) slow flow/no-reflow, coronary dissection, perforation, and hemodynamic instability were rare and not significantly different.

A total of 1,205 patients were treated with staged PCI (n = 576) or culprit-only PCI (n = 629) from January 2006 to December 2015 in our center. After propensity-score matching, 415 pairs of patients were identified, and postmatching absolute standardized differences were <10% for all covariates. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or unplanned revascularization. The mean follow-up duration was 5 years. Overall, staged complete revascularization was associated with lower risks of MACCE, MI, unplanned revascularization, and a composite of cardiac death, MI or stroke compared with culprit-only PCI in both overall population and propensity-matched cohorts. In Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the strategy of staged PCI was consistently a significant predictor of lower incidences of MACCE, MI, unplanned revascularization and a composite of cardiac death, MI, or stroke. However, there was no difference in the risks of MACCE, MI and unplanned revascularization between the 2 approaches for diabetic patients. In conclusion, among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease who underwent primary PCI, an approach of staged complete revascularization is superior to culprit-only PCI at 5-year follow-up. Nevertheless, the advantage of staged PCI is attenuated in diabetic patients."

Clinical rheumatology,2019 06 08,"Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is quite unusual in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although cerebral vasculitis, rheumatoid nodules and meningitis have all been reported, and patients with RA may also have CNS comorbidities such as stroke and neuro-degenerative and demyelinating syndromes. It has been found that biological drugs, especially anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) drugs, slightly increase the risk of developing demyelinating diseases, and they are consequently discouraged in patients with multiple sclerosis and related disorders. Furthermore, the risk of opportunistic CNS infections is increased in immunosuppressed patients. To review the current literature concerning CNS involvement in patients with RA (including RA-related forms and comorbidities) and the incidence of new-onset CNS diseases in patients with RA undergoing biological treatment (anti-TNF or non-anti-TNF drugs), the Medline database was searched using the key words 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'central nervous system', 'anti-TNF', 'abatacept', 'tocilizumab', 'rituximab' and 'anakinra'. Abstracts not in English were excluded. We selected 76 articles published between 1989 and 2017, which were divided into four groups on the basis of whether CNS involvement was RA-related or not and according to the type of biological agent used (TNF inhibitors or other agents). The RA-related diseases included aseptic meningitis, vasculitis and cerebral rheumatoid nodules, which benefit from immunosuppressive treatments. CNS comorbidities included stroke, seizures, dementia and neuropsychiatric disorders, which have been frequently described in biological agent-naïve patients with RA, and other rarely reported neurological diseases, such as extra-pyramidal syndromes and demyelinating disorders. CNS comorbidities are relatively frequent among patients with RA and may be related to systemic inflammation or concomitant medications. The use of anti-TNF drugs is associated with the risk of developing demyelinating diseases, and CNS infections have been described in patients treated with anti-TNF and non-anti-TNF agents. Non-anti-TNF drugs may be preferred in the case of demyelinating diseases, cerebral vasculitis or neurolupus. Patients with RA may suffer from CNS involvement as a manifestation of RA or as a comorbidity. The treatment of such medical conditions should be guided on the basis of their etiopathogenesis: steroids and immunosuppressants are useful in the case of RA-related CNS diseases but are often detrimental in other situations. Similarly, the choice of biological agents in patients with RA with CNS complications should be guided by a correct diagnosis in order to prevent further complications.",Time to diagnosis of fibromyalgia and factors associated with delayed diagnosis in primary care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174818,Best practice & research. Clinical rheumatology,2019 06 08,"Fibromyalgia is a complex disorder, and its diagnosis often comprises a challenge for physicians. We aimed to assess the time from the appearance of early symptoms to the definite diagnosis of fibromyalgia and to delineate patient and physician factors associated with this delay. The database of a large healthcare services provider was searched for all fibromyalgia patients (age 21 years or more) diagnosed during 2008-2011. Patients with a diagnosis confirmed by a physician with a relevant specialization were compared with age- and sex-matched nonfibromyalgia controls to retrospectively identify an initial complaint pattern characteristic of fibromyalgia. The time from initial complaints to fibromyalgia diagnosis, as well as the fraction of time while the patient was treated continuously by the same primary physician as at time of diagnosis, was assessed among all eligible fibromyalgia patients. An initial complaint pattern was identified in 67.9% of 2,055 patients with confirmed fibromyalgia vs. 27.6% of 9,172 controls. Among 2,369 (69.0%) of all 3,434 eligible patients with fibromyalgia, mean (SD) total time to diagnosis was 6.42 (3.57) years and mean (SD) time while treated by the same primary physician as at diagnosis was 3.75 (3.26) years. Comorbidity, younger patient, and older physician age were associated with longer time to diagnosis. By analysis of ""real-world"" data, fibromyalgia remains a complex and elusive diagnosis, taking years to be properly diagnosed. There is a need to increase the awareness of this syndrome among physicians, especially of older age.",Real time monitoring of the combined effect of chlorophyll content and light filtering packaging on virgin olive oil photo-stability using mesh cell-FTIR spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174814,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The present work aimed at examining the combined effect of chlorophyll content and light filtering packaging material on the photo-stability of virgin olive oil (VOO) via mesh cell-FTIR spectroscopy monitoring. Four different VOOs of Koroneiki cultivar differing in total chlorophyll content (∼12-46 mg/kg) were exposed in parallel to direct visible light (6000 lx, 24 °C, 344 h) and FTIR spectra were recorded periodically with or without applying light protection by an industrial filter used for packaging. Findings suggested that the protective role of light filtering material was more evident in the VOO with the lowest total chlorophyll content. Real time monitoring of VOO by mesh cell-FTIR was found to be a useful tool to follow the combined effect of pro-oxidant chlorophylls and the protective light filtering materials on the photo-oxidation process of VOO employing a minute sample amount.",Epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids as non-volatile lipid oxidation products in oat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174813,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence and formation of peroxygenase catalysed non-volatile oxidised fatty acids (NVOFAs), especially epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids, which potentially provide off-flavours in oat. A method based on extraction of NVOFAs using accelerated solvent extraction and analysis by UHPLC-ELSD/MS was developed. Hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids from oleic and linoleic acids were present as major NVOFAs in non-heat treated (NHT) oat products, and the contents increased markedly during storage. In a controlled storage experiment, NVOFA contents in NHT oat flours increased to 1700-2000 µg/g, whereas in heat-treated samples, only to 200-400 µg/g. Epoxy fatty acids seemed to be the first products that occurred, followed by hydroxy fatty acids and minor NVOFAs. The formation of NVOFAs was related to lipase catalysed lipid hydrolysis and the formation of volatile lipid oxidation products. Inactivation of lipid degrading enzymes is crucial to producing stable oat products.","Influence of the storage temperature on volatile emission, carotenoid content and chilling injury development in Star Ruby red grapefruit.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174812,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Grapefruits are sensitive to develop chilling injury (CI) on the peel upon postharvest storage at low temperature. We investigated the influence of the storage at 2 and 12 °C on CI, carotenoids, and emission of volatiles by intact fruit. CI symptoms at 12 °C were restricted to green fruit peel sectors but at 2 °C the CI severity was higher and distributed through the whole fruit surface. Fruit peel coloration and carotenes content increased at 12 °C whereas experienced minor changes at 2 °C. At 2 °C the emission of total volatiles and specific monoterpenes, mainly limonene, but also linalool and α-terpineol was enhanced, while storage at 12 °C resulted in higher emission and diversity of cyclic sesquiterpenes and aliphatic esters. Results indicate a selective emission of volatiles by intact red grapefruit that appears to be a specific response to the storage temperature or to the cold-induced damage.",Development and optimization of pH-responsive PLGA-chitosan nanoparticles for triggered release of antimicrobials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174811,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The aim of this work was to develop and optimize a pH-responsive nanoparticle based on poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and chitosan (CHIT) for delivery of natural antimicrobial using trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCIN) as a model compound. The optimization was performed using a central composite design and the desirability function approach. The optimized levels of variables considering all significant responses were 4% (w/w) of TCIN and 6.75% (w/w) of CHIT. After, optimized nanoparticles were produced and characterized according to their physicochemical properties and their antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Optimized nanoparticles characterization indicated a satisfactory TCIN encapsulation (33.20 ± 0.85%), spherical shape, pH-responsive controlled release, with faster release in the presence of CHIT at low pH, and enhanced antimicrobial activity against both pathogens. TCIN encapsulation using PLGA coated with CHIT enhanced its antimicrobial activity and generated a delivery system with pH-sensitivity for controlled release with promising properties for food safety applications.","Effect of ionic liquids 1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromide or 1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride on thermophysical properties and taste behavior of sucrose in aqueous media at different temperatures: Volumetric, compressibility and viscometric properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174810,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The thermophysical properties and taste behavior of sucrose in aqueous ionic liquids {1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium bromide and 1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride} solutions have been studied via volumetric, compressibility and viscometric properties at T = (288.15, 298.15, 308.15 and 318.15) K. The positive values of transfer volume and transfer partial molar isentropic compression indicated predominance of ionic-hydrophilic interactions in these systems. The calculated hydration number for sucrose demonstrated that dehydration of sucrose occurs in presence of both studied ionic liquids. Further, the effect of studied ionic liquids on the taste behaviour of sucrose has been discussed from ASV and ASIC parameters. Furthermore, interaction volume, Vint, and cavity volume, Vcav, have been computed from scaled particle theory (SPT).",Biochemical characterization of a novel GH43 family β-xylosidase from Bacillus pumilus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174809,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Although β-xylosidases have a wide range of applications, cold-active β-xylosidases have been poorly studied. In this study, a cold active β-xylosidase gene (xyl) from Bacillus pumilus TCCC 11,350 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant XYL (rXYL) was revealed to be a bifunctional enzyme with both β-xylosidase and α-l-arabinofuranosidase activities. Purified rXYL was most active at 30 °C, demonstrating 26% and 18% of its maximum activity at 4 °C and 0 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, rXYL showed a 52% activity in 200 mM xylose, indicating a relatively strong tolerance to xylose. Moreover, rXYL exhibited a high synergistic effect (11.14-fold and 16.21-fold) with endo-xylanase to degrade beechwood xylan in both sequential and simultaneous reactions at low temperatures. As the first report on the novel cold-adapted β-xylosidase from B. pumilus, these results suggested rXYL had attractive properties for food industrial utilizations.","Impact of Clitoria ternatea (butterfly pea) flower on in vitro starch digestibility, texture and sensory attributes of cooked rice using domestic cooking methods.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174808,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The effect of Clitoria ternatea flower (CTE) incorporated into cooked rice using domestic cooking methods on starch digestibility was determined. The incorporation of 1.25% and 2.5% (w/v) CTE caused a reduction in the starch digestibility of cooked rice using an electric rice cooker. In addition, there was significant alteration on the starch digestibility of cooked rice incorporated with 2.5% CTE using a microwave oven. Moreover, CTE significantly reduced the level of rapidly digestible starch and increased the level of undigested starch in cooked rice using an electric rice cooker. In the textural characteristics, the hardness of cooked rice with CTE remained unchanged, whereas a reduction in stickiness of cooked rice with CTE was observed. The sensory evaluation of cooked rice with CTE given by panelists demonstrated a good overall acceptability. Overall, the results show that CTE is a useful ingredient to incorporate with cooked rice for reduction of starch digestibility.",Pesticide residues quantification in frozen fruit and vegetables in Chilean domestic market using QuEChERS extraction with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization Orbitrap mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174807,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Pesticide residues on foods are a global concern due to the impact on human health. Many countries have adopted regulations to establish Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) to control use of pesticides. This study aimed to determine pesticide residues in frozen fruit and vegetables from Chilean retail stores using UHPLC-Orbitrap MS and QuEChERS™ multiresidue-extraction kit. 237 samples of frozen produce were sampled from different supermarkets and times during the year. Abamectin, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, Iprodione, λ-cyhalothrin, Spinosad A, and Spinosad D were quantified. Results showed that Iprodione, Spinosad A, and D were the most detected molecules. Pesticides were detected in 96.6% of samples and 21 samples exceeded MRL. Corn and faba beans showed the highest concentration of Iprodione with an average of 6.7 and 5.4 mg/Kg, respectively. Existence of nonconformity in samples highlights the importance to control pesticide residues of Chilean frozen produce, since it represents a latent health threat on consumers."

Stevioside, rubusoside, and rebaudioside A are natural sweet compounds from plants. These compounds have the same skeleton and only contain different side-chain glucosyl groups, making them difficult to separate. However, enzymes that target diterpenoid compounds and show specific activity for side-chain glucosyl groups are rare. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of an enzyme that can target both diterpenoid compounds and sophorose, namely, β-glucosidase SPBGL1 from Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461. SPBGL1 displayed high specificity toward sophorose, and activity toward stevioside, but not rebaudioside A. The stevioside conversion rate was 98%. SPBGL1 also operated at high substrate concentrations, such as in 50% crude steviol glycoside extract. Glucose liberated from stevioside was easy to quantify using the glucose oxidase method, allowing the stevioside content to be determined.",An improved method to determine the hydroxypropyl content in modified starches by 1H NMR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174795,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Hydroxypropyl (HP) starches are used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods. The properties of the etherified starches are dependent on the degree of hydroxypropylation. The objective of this study was to develop an improved acid hydrolysis method to degrade and solubilize HP starches for determining HP content in modified starches by 1H NMR. The effects of acid (DCl) concentration and temperature on hydrolysis and solubilization of hydroxypropylated starches were examined. The optimal conditions proposed to hydrolyze HP starches were 10% starch solid content, 3.5% (wt%) DCl in D2O as the solvent, sodium acetate as an internal standard, and heating at 90 °C for 1 h. Optionally, 6% (v/v) TFA-d may be added as the water-peak shifting reagent. Six hydroxypropylated starches and two cross-linked and hydroxypropylated starches were hydrolyzed with this improved acid method, and the results of the HP content were in agreement with those from an enzyme-catalyzed method.",An insight into the retrogradation behaviors and molecular structures of lotus seed starch-hydrocolloid blends.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174794,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The retrogradation behaviors and molecular structures of lotus seed starch (LS) combined with different hydrocolloids, chitosan (CS), guar gum (GG) and xanthan (XN), were investigated. Following an autoclave treatment, the storage modulus (G') value of LS-CS increased more rapidly than LS alone, indicating an increase in starch retrogradation. This might result from intermolecular interactions, increased ordered structure, decreased weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and greater leached amylose content in LS-CS system. The LS-GG and particularly LS-XN blends showed the opposite trend. The much greater Mw of LS-XN was mainly attributed to the lower retrogradation rate. The enwrapping effect of GG or XN on LS, as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, might retard their retrogradation by limiting the granules' swelling and the amylose leaching. Overall, the changes in the interaction force, ordered structure, Mw, leached amylose and microstructure were related to retrogradation behaviors of LS-hydrocolloid blends following an autoclave treatment.","Impact of infrared and dry air roasting on the oxidative stability, fatty acid composition, Maillard reaction products and other chemical properties of black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) seed oil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174793,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Black cumin seed (BCS) is a novel oil source with potential health benefits. This study investigates the influence of infrared (IR) and dry air (DA) roasting (140, 160 and 180 °C for 5 and 10 min) on BCS oil quality characteristics. Results revealed that the oxidative stability index (OSI), Maillard reaction products (MRPs), chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were increased while acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV) and color values were decreased in DA roasted (180°C for 10 min) BCS oil compared to other DA and IR treatments. DA and IR roasting slightly influenced the fatty acid composition (FAC) of BCS oils. FTIR spectra showed minor changes in peak intensities (at 2854, 2929 and 3008 cm-1) of DA and IR roasted BCS oils. DA roasting proved more effective than IR roasting. The oil from the DA roasted BCS at 180°C for 10 min had significantly higher oil quality and oxidative stability.","S,N co-doped graphene quantum dots-induced ascorbic acid fluorescent sensor: Design, characterization and performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174792,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"In this work, new detection route for ascorbic acid was designed. First, highly luminescent sulfur and nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (S,N-GQDs) were prepared via simple hydrothermal method using citric acid and thiourea as the C, N and S sources respectively. The prepared S,N-GQDs are characterized by XRD, HRTEM, FTIR, EDS and PL. Investigations showed that prepared S,N-GQDs have a good photostability and excitation-dependent emission fluorescence. Prepared S,N-GQDs showed maximum excitation wavelength and emission wavelength at 400 and 462 nm, respectively. In the following, prepared S,N-GQDs were applied as a photoluminescence probe for detection of ascorbic acid (AA). The designed sensor was based on ""off-on"" detection mode.

The results suggested that compared with the non-stressful percussion, ice/water and gill cut stunning resulted in accelerated muscle tenderization with intensive myofibril disintegration and sarcolemma-myofibril detachments. Myowater mobility and distribution were altered by stunning stress, in which gill cut facilitated the migration of immobilized water and free water, thus enhancing the centrifugation loss. In addition, stunning stress promoted the activation of endogenous proteases and the release of cathepsin B and L from lysosomes to myofibrils, which showed significant (P < 0.01) correlations with decreased shear force and elevated myofibril fragmentation index of fillets. Therefore, faster accumulation of cathepsins and myofibril disintegration together contributed to the weakening of texture and WHC in stunning-stressed fish fillets.",Development of a DNA marker for variety discrimination specific to 'Manten-Kirari' based on an NGS-RNA sequence in Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174789,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"To discriminate the trace-rutinosidase variety of Tartary buckwheat 'Manten-Kirari', we developed DNA markers based on RNA polymorphism. Specifically, we mapped 17.76 GB RNA sequences, obtained using HiSeq2000, to create 11,358 large contigs constructed de novo from 'Manten-Kirari' RNA derived from GS-FLX+ titanium. From these, we developed eight DNA markers corresponding to single- to four-nucleotide polymorphisms between 'Manten-Kirari' and 'Hokkai T8', which is representative of normal rutinosidase content varieties in Japan. Using these markers, 'Manten-Kirari' was discriminated from 'Hokkai T8' by eight markers, from major Tartary buckwheat varieties by three markers, and from common buckwheats by two markers. We also performed direct PCR from flour and dried noodle made with 'Manten-Kirari' and 'Hokkai T8'. Based on the results, the DNA markers developed are promising for discriminating 'Manten-Kirari'. This is the first study to develop a DNA marker to discriminate varieties in the Polygonaceae family including buckwheat species.",Potential geo-discriminative tools to trace the origins of the dried slices of shiitake (Lentinula edodes) using stable isotope ratios and OPLS-DA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174788,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The Lentinus edodes species, known as shiitake, has a history of extensive use in many cuisines in several East Asian countries owing to its unique and pleasant flavor and texture. As international food trade increases, reliable discrimination of geographical origin is becoming increasingly crucial in Korea to identify cheaper imported Chinese shiitake. Herein, stable isotope ratios (i.e., δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, and δ34S) were measured with a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and a geographical discrimination method using orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis was developed. The externally validated discrimination method showed excellent predictability (Q2cum = 0.881) and illustrated that δ18O and δ15N were important isotope markers for the geographical discrimination of dried shiitake slices. This study extends the knowledge of geographical differences between China and Korea evidenced by the shiitake isotope signatures, thereby contributing to potential geographical authentication with broader applications for international shiitake markets.",Reconciliation of the D/z model and the Arrhenius model: The effect of temperature on inactivation rates of chemical compounds and microorganisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174787,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The effect of temperature on thermal inactivation of microorganisms and thermal degradation of certain chemical compounds can be either described by the Arrhenius model for the rate constant (k) or by the D/z model for the decimal reduction time (D). Although equivalent, it is difficult to directly reconcile these two models which have different model structures. This study hypothesized that the two models can be reconciled by linearization of the inverse of absolute temperature (1/T) and heating temperature (T), and the activation energy (Ea) can be directly calculated from z and their relationship is independent of T. The hypothesis was validated using the z and Ea of various chemical compounds, enzymes, and vegetative cells and spores of microorganisms in various substrates published in the literature. The results of this study show that the empirical models are practically reconciled.","Effect of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone treatment on rosés wines during fermentation: Impact on color, polyphenols and thiol aromas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174786,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Fining treatment with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is often used during winemaking of rosé wines. It can modulate the intensity and hue of their pink color and prevent some organoleptic degradations. In this paper, the effect of PVPP treatments on rosé wine during fermentation was investigated by measuring color, polyphenol content and thiol aromas. As expected, colorimetry results showed a decrease in color, indicating some adsorption of anthocyanins and other pigments. This was confirmed by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses. Specific adsorption of certain families of polyphenols was evidenced. Flavonols, flavanols and anthocyanins, especially coumaroylated anthocyanins were preferentially adsorbed by PVPP. The thiol content (3-sulfanylhexyl acetate (3SHA) and 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3SH)) was usually higher after PVPP treatments, in a dose dependent manner. A possible explanation is that the partial adsorption of some polyphenols at an early stage of fermentation would later limit the amount of quinone compounds able to trap thiol aromas."

Upon cold storage (4 °C) processing cultivars maintained low reducing sugars as compared to non-processing cultivars. Sequencing of the INH2 gene identified four alleles of which three identified as novel alleles. A total twelve SNPs resulted in silent mutations, with five conferring the amino acid substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a highly conserved nature of the INH2 gene. The 3D predicted structures generated for all the alleles revealed slight variations in the orientation of the helices (α1-3) in N-terminal region. Sequence polymorphism observed in INH2 alleles in processing and non-processing potato cultivars can be correlated with the observed variations in the sugar content suggesting a possible role in cold-induced sweetening.",A rapid and reliable multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of fourteen animal species in two tubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174774,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"A simple and rapid method for animal species identification to prevent food adulteration based on mitochondrial DNA using two independent multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and microchip electrophoresis was developed. This method was designed to identify fourteen domestic animals (Group I: cattle, donkey, dog, fox, raccoon-dog, deer and horse; Group II: pig, sheep, goat, chicken, duck, cat and mouse) simultaneously using ten pairs of primers and three of which were degenerate primers. Sequences for species-specific primers were generated based on mitochondrial genes, including 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ND2 and CO I. This method was validated in terms of the specificity, sensitivity and practicability, and the developed multiplex PCR method was able to correctly identify animal species of raw meats and processed meat products. The detection limits of two multiplex PCRs were 0.02 ng DNA for animal species in Group I and 0.2 ng DNA for Group II, respectively.",The effects of geographical origin and virus infection on the saffron (Crocus sativus L.) quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174773,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Saffron is appreciated by its colour, taste, and aroma. To examine the effect of abiotic and biotic stress on these main properties, in the span of 2014-2016, saffron stigmas were collected from major different saffron cultivation areas of Iran and saffron quality was estimated. The quality of saffron was assessed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy following the ISO3632:2011 standard. However, the composition and concentration of crocetin esters, picrocrocin, safranal, and kaempferols, the most critical compounds determining the properties and quality of saffron can vary with the geographical origin and virus effects, being more accurate High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and Diode Array Detection (HPLC-DAD) methods were used to analyze saffron quality. Using HPLC-DAD we analyzed saffron plants grown at various conditions (considering altitude, temperature, and precipitation/rainfall) and in presence/absence of virus infections; we found that edaphoclimatic and cultivation conditions significantly determine the quality of the spice and the presence of virus modifies the content of its metabolites.","Assessing the effect of season, montanera length and sampling location on Iberian pig fat by compositional data analysis and standard multivariate statistics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174772,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The work studies the effect of season, montanera length, and sampling location on the Iberian pig fat, using compositional data (CoDa) analysis and standard statistics. CoDa variation array and logratios involving C18:3: (C18:3/C17:1), (C18:3/C20:0), and (C18:3/18:0) as well as the ilr balances (coordinates), based on C18:3, C17:1, and C20:0, showed the highest variances. Discriminant Analysis (DA) led to similar (conventional/coordinates) correct assignations regarding seasons (69/70%), montanera length (71/70%) and sampling location (68/67%). Re-analyzing the subcomposition of only the major fatty acids (FAs), led to slightly poorer results; therefore, the removed FAs might play a role in segregation. Results are in line with those from other authors and could indicate a partial capacity of pigs to control their FA profiles. Overall, CoDa analysis provided useful information on data variability, the effects of factors and, after conversion into coordinates, allowed applying standard statistics while being respectful with the compositional sampling space.",In silico annotation of discriminative markers of three Zanthoxylum species using molecular network derived annotation propagation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174771,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics, data matrices with up to thousands of variables for each ion peak are subjected to multivariate analysis (MVA) to assess the homogeneity between samples. The large dimensions of LC/MS datasets hinder the identification of the discriminant or the metabolic markers. In the present study, the molecular network (MN) approach and two in silico annotation tools, network annotation propagation (NAP) and the hierarchical chemical classification method, ClassyFire, were used to annotate the metabolites of three Zanthoxylum species, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium and Z. piperitum. The in silico annotation results of the MN nodes and the MVA variables were combined and visualized in loading plots. This approach helped intuitive detection of the variables that greatly contributed to the separation of the samples in the score plot as discriminant or metabolic markers, thereby allowing rapid annotation of two flavanone derivatives.",Effects of Lactobacillus plantarum NJAU-01 on the protein oxidation of fermented sausage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174770,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum NJAU-01 isolated from Chinese dry-cured ham (Jinhua ham) on the regulation of protein oxidation of fermented sausages. Fermented sausages were prepared with different concentrations of L. plantarum NJAU-01 (105 CFU/g, 107 CFU/g and 109 CFU/g), and the commercial strain was used as positive control. The results showed that L. plantarum NJAU-01 at 107 CFU/g and 109 CFU/g significantly lowered the protein carbonyl content and protein surface hydrophobicity compared with the control (P < 0.05). The total sulfhydryl contents in L. plantarum NJAU-01 groups were significantly higher than that of the group without starter culture (P < 0.05). Significant changes were found in sarcoplasmic protein bands within 130-250 kDa, 100-130 kDa and 25-35 kDa during sausage fermentation (P < 0.05). Our data suggest that L. plantarum NJAU-01 has the potential to be an antioxidant starter culture in fermented sausages.",Label free aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of tobramycin residue in pasteurized cow's milk based on resonance scattering spectra and nanogold catalytic amplification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174769,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"TOB aptamer can be adsorbed on the AuNPs surface to form AuNPs-aptamer complexation to prevent AuNPs aggregation in high salt solution. When TOB was added to the AuNPs solution, the aptamer would bind with TOB and depart from the AuNPs surface. The amount of the AuNPs-aptamer complexation depends on the TOB concentration. Different concentration of AuNPs-aptamer can catalyze the reduction reaction of CuSO4 to produce different size Cu2O particle. The resonance scattering peak intensities are correlated with the Cu2O size. Large size Cu2O particle as a resonance scattering spectroscopy probe can remarkable improve the TOB detection sensitivity. We have succeeded to detect the trace TOB in aqueous solutions. The linear range and limit of detection were 0.50-17 nM and 0.19 nM, respectively. This simple and inexpensive method exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, which was successfully used to detect TOB in milk.

More than 50 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified: 25 anthocyanins, 17 flavonols, 7 hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, 2 stilbenes, and several flavan-3-ols. As far as we know, some anthocyanin and flavonol dihexosides were reported for the first time in V. vinifera L. grapes. Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to experimental data showed a good separation of the novel grape genotypes and Tempranillo according to the phenolic profile of skins and seeds, mainly based on the proportion of trisubstituted anthocyanin derivatives, flavonols and flavan-3-ols, being a useful tool to differentiate these grape varieties.",Nutritional composition and bioactivity of Umbilicus rupestris (Salisb.)

In this work, the leaves of Umbelicus rupestris (Salisb.) Dandy, an edible species for which only scarce data is available in literature, were thoroughly evaluated for its nutritional profile, chemical characterization and bioactive properties. Being considered a succulent plant, the leaves revealed a very high content of moisture, with several beneficial compounds, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and different polyphenols. A total of twelve flavonoids, three phenolic acids and one phenylpropanoid glucoside were identified in the decoction and/or hydroethanolic extracts, with most of them being described for the first time in this plant.

It concerns techniques that allow organic or biodynamic wines to be distinguished from conventional products. Other aspects of the organic wines addressed include the antioxidant capacities and the content of compounds potentially toxic to human health, like metals, such as copper, deriving from treatments in the vineyard, or ochratoxin A and biogenic amines. Organic wines, in which, unlike non-organic wines, the SO2 must be lower or absent, may undergo premature ageing and present high levels of oxidation compounds. Some authors used selected indigenous yeasts to reduce the production of these molecules and improve the organoleptic quality of the wine. Also, the effects of biodynamic viticulture practices on the chemical and sensory characteristics of wines are compared with other conventional or organic products. With the growing market interest, differences among conventional, organic and, moreover, biodynamic wines, require more in-depth analysis."

The FAMEs profile of the cultivar 'GAL' was studied under two farming practices, (i) organic, 'GAL-E' and conventional, 'GAL-T'. Eleven FAMEs were identified, the predominant ones were cis-palmitoleic acid (pulp) and oleic and palmitic acid (peel). When comparing the FAMEs profiles between organic and conventional 'GAL' peel jujube fruits, the 'GAL-E' (organic) presented a higher unsaturated/saturated ratio than the 'GAL-T' cultivar (conventional), while this relationship in the pulp was the opposite. The 'DAT' cultivar was interesting for its high palmitoleic acid content while the 'GAL-E' and 'GAL-T' cultivars had high contents of oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids. The LDA (linear discriminant analysis) model showed that the FAMEs contents could be used to discriminate the studied cultivars, and the agricultural practice, because all groups were clearly separated with no overlaps.",Alcohol acyltransferase gene and ester precursors differentiate composition of volatile esters in three interspecific hybrids of Vitis labrusca × V.

Results showed 'Moldova' showed lower esters content than 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba' resulting from its limited AAT gene expression and 20 different encoded amino acids. The volatile esters compositions of 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba' in both vintages were different. Correlation analysis revealed that concentrations of hexyl acetate, 2-phenethyl acetate, ethyl (E,E)-2,4-hexadienoate and ethyl phenylacetate were related to their corresponding alcohols level, whereas threonine and alanine affected ethyl heptanoate formation. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 1847, 1781 and 1870 DEGs, at E-L 35, 36 and 38, respectively, were characterized between 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba'.

The results showed that fresh camel milk powders had amorphous structure, clumsy spherical shape particles and almost 100% solubility in water. During storage at controlled low RH levels (<32% RH), reduction in moisture content and aw of the powders caused glass transition signals of lactose to evolve, although the powders exhibited a slight development of crystallinity. True density, colour (L*, a* and whiteness), and morphology were almost unchanged during storage while b* values associated with non-enzymatic browning, and fat oxidation into volatile compounds increased steadily. Over storage period, solubility of the powder declined just slightly and secondary structure of proteins unfolded from α-helices to β-sheets, loops and β-turns. These changes were more profound for the powders stored at 32% RH than those kept at 11 and 22% RH.","Hydroxycinnamic acid amide (HCAA) derivatives, flavonoid C-glycosides, phenolic acids and antioxidant properties of foxtail millet.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174752,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The profiles of phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of dehulled foxtail millets were studied. Twenty-one phenolics were detected in the free fraction, including a series of nine hydroxycinnamic acid spermidines reported for the first time and three flavonoid C-glycosides of kaempferol and apigenin. Twenty-three phenolic acid derivatives were detected in the bound fraction with ferulic acid being the predominant phenolic acid, as well as four ferulic acid dimers (DFAs) reported for the first time in foxtail millet.

This study examined the effects of exogenous Se on the growth, yield, nutritive value, and mineral accumulation of A. auricular. Selenate or selenite (0.5-40.0 μg g-1) had no effect on mycelium morphology or the yield of fruiting bodies. In some cases, they affected the accumulation of inter-elements and significantly decreased the concentrations of copper, iron, and chromium in the Se-enriched fruiting bodies compared to that with control treatments. The polysaccharide (116.5-131.6 μg g-1) and protein (105.2-113.4 μg g-1) content in Se-enriched fruiting bodies were not significantly different from those observed in the controls (polysaccharide, 114.1 μg g-1; protein, 105.6 μg g-1). Thus, A. auricular can absorb inorganic Se from the substrate and convert it to organic Se compounds (selenocystine (≥4.1%), selenomethionine (≥91.9%), and Se-methylselenocysteine (≥2.3%)).",Chemometric studies of the effects of milk fat replacement with different proportions of vegetable oils in the formulation of fat-filled milk powders: Implications for quality assurance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174750,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Bovine milk lipids can be replaced with cheaper indigenous vegetable oils to produce milk alternatives with healthier saturated/unsaturated fat balance for those in areas where milk supply is poor or even absent. A wide range of vegetable oils can be used, but their impacts when blended with skimmed milk powder to formulate filled milk powder (FMP) are still unknown. We investigate the baseline variances in 12 types of FMP produced onsite with 3 proportions (10%, 20% and 30%) of 4 different vegetable oils (i.e., coconut, palm, soya-bean and sunflower) using fatty acid- and near infrared spectra profiles. Chemometric analyses revealed 8 significant overlapping clusters of FMP types but 100% classification efficiency was achieved. Sunflower oil, and particularly soya-bean FMP types had statistically the lowest indices of atherogenicity and thrombogenicity. This appears to be the first chemometrics study of FMP; the spectral analytical models used may be effective for product monitoring.","Sugar beet and apple fibres coupled with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as functional ingredients in gluten-free formulations: Rheological, technological and sensory aspects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174749,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The presented study examined the influence of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), sugar beet fibre (SBF) and apple fibre (AF) incorporation coupled with adequate water levels on gluten-free (GF) batter rheology, bread quality and sensory characteristics.

However, the surface active nature of the oil has not yet been investigated. The present research explored the surface active components in coffee oil, and those responsible for stability of microbubbles at the air-water interface, facilitating its surfactant behavior. The oil's performance was examined through surface tension analysis, foam formation, coalescence rate and foam characteristics (using coffee as a model beverage for foam characterization). These observations confirmed the suitability of coffee oil as a natural substitute for Tween series of surfactants. The 1H NMR and LC-MS/MS assessments revealed trigonelline, caffeic acid, caffeine, feruloyl quinic acid, di-caffeoyl quinic acid, quinic acid, coumaroyl quinic acid as polar constitutes in coffee oil. These constituents help in formation of the self-assembly (chlorogenic acid - hydrophilic head, hydrocarbon - hydrophobic tail), ultimately forming micelle in coffee. Coffee oil also aided maintenance of a well sustained foam in coffee, similar to other synthetic surfactants.",Chemical changes that occur in Jerusalem artichoke silage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174747,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"The effects of 10 and 20 days of fermentation followed by freeze-drying on the vitamin C and fatty acids contents, chemical conversions and overall chemical composition of Jerusalem artichoke were studied. Fermentation between the 10th and 20th days increased content of all saturated fatty acids and two of the four unsaturated fatty acids. The only fatty acid content that decreased was that of C18:1 cis 9 acid, which was suggested to be converted to other fatty acids. The experimental data, which were supported by energetical feasibility, suggested the reaction pathways of the mutual conversions of fatty acids and confirmed the decreased vitamin C content during fermentation. Discriminant modelling of the spectral data successfully distinguished the fresh, 10 days and 20 days fermented samples. The correlation of the spectral and reference data allowed to construct reference models for predicting the content of vitamin C and C18:1 cis 9 fatty acid.","Green extraction of polyphenols from grapefruit peels using high voltage electrical discharges, deep eutectic solvents and aqueous glycerol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174746,Food chemistry,2019 06 08,"Deep eutectic solvents (DES) and aqueous glycerol were proposed as green alternatives to conventional solvents for the extraction of polyphenols from grapefruit peels.

Congenital and acquired etiologies are hypothesized. Although right auricular aneurysm has been described in dogs, this is the first case report of an aneurysm of the left auricle of a dog with an intact pericardium. In humans, because complications of arrhythmia and thromboembolic disease have been reported, surgical resection of left auricular aneurysm is recommended. This report describes the successful surgical resection of a left auricular aneurysm in a dog, including a one-year follow up.

Echocardiographic examination revealed tricuspid valve dysplasia with only two small orifices in the valve resulting in severe tricuspid stenosis. The dog underwent a right fifth lateral intercostal thoracotomy and surgical tricuspid valvulotomy, under cardiopulmonary bypass. The stenosis was relieved by dividing the valve leaflets between the two orifices with continuation to the commissures, creating a 'bileaflet' valve. The dog made a good recovery initially, with echocardiography at 48 h after surgery showing a reduction in tricuspid valve E and A wave velocities and pressure half-time (from 230 ms to 65 ms). She was discharged five days after surgery, and spironolactone, benazepril, pimobendan, and clopidogrel were prescribed. The dog was re-presented two days later having collapsed, with pyrexia, facial swelling, and pitting edema on the ventral neck and intermandibular region. Investigations did not reveal an underlying cause, and the clinical signs resolved with supportive therapy. Two years after surgery, the dog was free of clinical signs with normal exercise tolerance and only mild tricuspid regurgitation on echocardiography, with discontinuation of all medications.",Cor triatriatum dexter in 17 dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174723,Journal of veterinary cardiology : the official journal of the European Society of Veterinary Cardiology,2019 06 08,"The objective of this study was to report the signalment, presentation, clinical and imaging findings, interventions, and outcomes in a group of dogs with cor triatriatum dexter (CTD)."

Clinical settings are adopting quitline referral as a method for providing cessation support but little is known regarding enrollment and engagement following these referrals. We used data from quitline fax-back reports to describe enrollment and treatment engagement of 878 hospitalized patients who smoke who were referred via secure email to quitline at discharge. We compared patient demographics, tobacco characteristics, and treatment engagement between those enrolled and not enrolled. We conducted chi-square and t-tests to determine which variables should be included in a logistic regression to determine predictors of quitline enrollment. We did not receive fax-back reports for 25% (n = 221) of referred patients; these were excluded from all but the intent-to-treat analysis. Among patients for whom we received reports, 20.4% enrolled and accepted at least one service from the quitline. Among the 79.6% (n = 523) of patients who smoke not enrolled, most (78.3%; n = 410) were classified by the quitline as unreachable. Age (p = .006), smoking within 30 min of waking (p = .005), and interest in quitting (p = .008) were significant predictors of quitline enrollment. Using an intent to treat analysis, 11.4% (n = 100) of all referred patients were enrolled and accepted a single or multi-call programs; 4.2% (n = 37) of all referred patients enrolled and accepted a multi-call counseling program. Quitlines are a pillar of U.S. tobacco treatment. For quitlines to fulfill their potential, quitlines and hospitals must identify effective strategies for reaching and treating referred patients who smoke. Quitlines are effective and are readily available to many in advanced economy countries. Treatment engagement appears to be a barrier to quitline participation as we found few patients who were referred to the quitline actually enrolled in care. Quitlines should consider adopting alternative methods for reaching patients who smoke. Future research is warranted to determine effective solutions to breakdowns in transitions of care.",Brief interventions for young adults who use drugs: The moderating effects of resilience and trauma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174710,Journal of substance abuse treatment,2019 06 11,"Among participants in an intervention clinical trial (N = 602), we examined resilience as a moderator of substance use outcomes by intervention condition and between participants with and without severe traumatic stress (STS). Eligibility included men and women ages 18-39 with recent multidrug use; drug treatment enrollees were excluded. Outcome measures were past 90-day frequencies of substance use and abstinence. Putative moderators were measured using the Resilience Research Centre's Adult Resilience Measure (RRC-ARM) and the Traumatic Stress Scale from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN). Analyses employed hierarchical linear models. High resilience predicted better substance use outcomes, and the ordering of intervention effects for high resilience participants was stepwise by intervention condition intensity. Participants with low resilience scores had poorer outcomes, and those outcomes were largely unaffected by intervention condition. Participants without STS experienced the interventions similarly to the overall sample. Regardless of the level of resilience, however, participants with STS did not benefit from the interventions. The findings point to the importance of screening for both resilience and traumatic stress prior to intervention to maximize the impact of brief interventions for substance users, and also to link those needing more intensive approaches to additional services and professional care.",What happens to agreement over time? A longitudinal study of self-reported substance use compared to saliva toxicological testing among subsidized housing residents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174709,Journal of substance abuse treatment,2019 06 08,"The agreement between self-reported and toxicologically verified substance use provides important information about the validity of self-reported use. While some studies report aggregate agreement across follow-up points, only a few have examined the agreement at each time point separately. An overall rate of agreement across time may miss changes that occur as people progress through a research study. In this study, a sample of 644 adults (43.8% male, 32.6% White, 57.0% Black, 90.2% ages 36+) residing in subsidized housing was used to determine the agreement between self-reported use and saliva toxicological testing for marijuana, cocaine, PCP, amphetamine, and methamphetamine at three different time points. Agreement between saliva toxicological testing and self-report ranged between 84.2% and 94.3% for different substances over time. Higher rates of agreement were found for cocaine than had been reported by previous studies. Statistically significant differences in the odds ratios of concordance over time (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up) were found for marijuana and the combined category for PCP, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. Our findings suggest that oral fluid drug tests generally withstand community field assessments and result in relatively high levels of agreement for marijuana, cocaine, PCP, amphetamine, and methamphetamine use, when compared to self-report. Because of the ease of sample collection and low chance of adulteration, we conclude that saliva testing is a viable method for toxicological confirmation of substance use behavior in this setting.",Is fidelity to motivational interviewing associated with alcohol outcomes in treatment-seeking 60+ year-old citizens?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174708,Journal of substance abuse treatment,2019 06 08,"Part of the variability in treatment outcomes for Motivational Interviewing (MI) may be explained by differences in the fidelity to MI.

Eradication rate of H. pylori infection by the classic triple treatment of PPIs and antibiotics is low. Therefore, probiotics are a useful tool for improving the rate of eradication and reduction of side effects. Several studies in animal models showed that Lactobacillus spp. alone and in combination with other probiotic strains have inhibitory effects on growth and suppression of inflammatory responses in H. pylori infections. However, some studies showed significant effects of Pediococcus strains on suppression, survival, and eradication of H. pylori infections. Therefore, it is suggested that in the treatment of H. pylori infections along with the usual probiotic strains, different strains of Pediococcus could be used. Recent studies showed that Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus gasseri alone with PPIs in human have a high eradication effect on H. pylori infections and it is suggested as the probiotic treatment of patient's in future therapeutic protocols. In relation to the probiotic treatment process, it should not be recommended that probiotics could be used as a single treatment for H. pylori eradication. However, use of probiotics as a supplement will increase eradication and reduce side effects associated with treatment. It is widely believed that probiotics could improve the eradication of H. pylori and reduce side effects during standard treatment, but some probiotic bacterial species could be useful with drug therapy. Generally, probiotic supplements could increase the eradication rate of H. pylori infections and reduced the side effects of antibiotics.","Comparative molecular characterization, pathogenicity and seroprevalence of avian influenza virus H9N2 in commercial and backyard poultry flocks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174705,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",2019 06 08,"This study was conducted to perform the comparative molecular characterization of avian influenza virus (AIV) H9N2, pathogenicity and seroprevalence in commercial and backyard poultry flocks. Fifty commercial poultry flocks were investigated between 2012 and 2015. Eighteen flocks (36%) out of 50 were positive HA. Seven (38.9%) out of 18 were positive by chromatographic strip test for AI common antigen. By Real-time RT-PCR, only two flocks were positive H9. The molecular characterization of two different AI-H9N2 viruses, one isolated from a broiler flock (A/chicken/Egypt/Mansoura-18/2013) and the other from a layer flock (A/chicken/Egypt/Mansoura-36/2015) was conducted on HA gene. Moreover, a higher seroprevalence, using the broiler strain as a known antigen, was shown in backyard chicken flocks 15/26 (57.7%) than duck flocks 9/74 (12.2%). Interestingly, the pathogenicity index (PI) of the H9N2 broiler strain in inoculated experimental chickens ranged from 1.2 (oculonasal route) to 1.9 (Intravenous route). The PI indicated a highly pathogenic effect, with high mortality (up to 100%) in the inoculated chickens correlated with the high mortality (80%) in the flock where the virus was isolated. The firstly recorded clinical signs, including cyanosis in the combs and wattles and subcutaneous haemorrhages in the leg shanks and lesions, as well as histopathology and immunohistochemistry, revealed a systemic infection of the high pathogenicity with the H9N2 virus. Conversely, the H9N2 layer strain showed a low pathogenicity. In conclusion, as a first report, the molecular analysis and pathogenicity of the tested strains confirmed the presence of a high pathogenicity AIV-H9N2 with systemic infections.","Full genome characterization of Iranian H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix), 2017: The first report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174704,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",2019 06 08,"During 2014-2017 Clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) have spread worldwide. In 2016, an epidemic of HPAIV H5N8 in Iran caused mass deaths among wild birds, and several commercial poultry farms and captive bird holdings were affected and continue to experience problems. Several outbreaks were reported in 2017. One of them is related to Hooded crow (Corvus cornix) in a national park in Esfahan province in 2017. Whole genome sequencing and characterization have been done on the detected H5N8 sample. Based on HA sequencing results, it belongs to 2.3.4.4 clade, and the cleavage site is (PLREKRRKR/G). Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that the Iran 2017 H5N8 virus clustered within subgroup Russia 2016 2.3.4.4 b of group B in H5 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIV. On the other hand, the NA gene of the virus is placed in group C of Eurasian lineage. Complete genome characterization of this virus revealed probable reassortment of the virus with East-Asian low-pathogenic influenza viruses. Furthermore, the virus possessed some phenotypic markers related to the increased potential for transmission and pathogenicity to mammals at internal segments. This study is the first full genome characterization H5N8 HPAIV in Iran. The data complete the puzzle of molecular epidemiology of H5N8 HPAIV in Iran and the region. Our study provides evidence for fast and continuing reassortment of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses, that might lead to changes in virus structural and functional characteristics such as the route and method of transmission of the virus and virus infective, pathogenic and zoonotic potential.","Genomic characterization and comparative analysis of Leptospira kirschneri serogroup Grippotyphosa UC5/2011, a strain isolated after mare abortion: Implications for genital animal leptospirosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174703,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",2019 06 08,"The genome of a Brazilian strain of Leptospira kirschneri serogroup Grippotyphosa isolated from a mare post-abortion was sequenced and analyzed.

It describes the development of recommendations for 5 outcomes determined by survey of persons with EB, caregivers, and experienced healthcare professionals. The outcomes include independence in activities of daily living (ADL), independence in instrumental ADL, maximization of hand function (non-surgical), fine motor development and retention, and oral feeding skills. The recommendations are supplemented with additional files that include photos and specific examples to further guide occupational therapists or, in situations where an OT is not available, other members of the healthcare team.As the disorder of EB is rare, evidence-based CPGs are needed to provide a base of knowledge and practice for OTs throughout the world with the goal of providing quality care to patients, while improving their functional independence and quality of life. In addition, this information is valuable as a basis for further research.","Comparison of modified total leaflet preservation, posterior leaflet preservation, and no leaflet preservation techniques in mitral valve replacement - a retrospective study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174558,Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,2019 06 11,"Mitral valve replacement with the total leaflet preservation technique can yield good results; however, its development is limited by patient-valve mismatch. Therefore, we compared the efficacies of the modified total leaflet preservation technique, posterior leaflet preservation technique, and no leaflet preservation technique in mitral valve replacement.",Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174557,Molecular neurodegeneration,2019 06 11,"Currently, over five million Americans suffer with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the absence of a cure, this number could increase to 13.8 million by 2050. A critical goal of biomedical research is to establish indicators of AD during the preclinical stage (i.e. biomarkers) allowing for early diagnosis and intervention. Numerous advances have been made in developing biomarkers for AD using neuroimaging approaches. These approaches offer tremendous versatility in terms of targeting distinct age-related and pathophysiological mechanisms such as structural decline (e.g. volumetry, cortical thinning), functional decline (e.g. fMRI activity, network correlations), connectivity decline (e.g. diffusion anisotropy), and pathological aggregates (e.g. amyloid and tau PET). In this review, we survey the state of the literature on neuroimaging approaches to developing novel biomarkers for the amnestic form of AD, with an emphasis on combining approaches into multimodal biomarkers. We also discuss emerging methods including imaging epigenetics, neuroinflammation, and synaptic integrity using PET tracers. Finally, we review the complementary information that neuroimaging biomarkers provide, which highlights the potential utility of composite biomarkers as suitable outcome measures for proof-of-concept clinical trials with experimental therapeutics.",Help seeking behavior for problematic substance uses in north-West Ethiopia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174556,"Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy",2019 06 14,"Substance miss use and neuro-psychiatric conditions are a growing public health challenges, but 76 to 85% of people with those disorders in low and middle-income countries did not receive treatment.

Penetration, from the intraventricular space, of extravasated red blood cells and extracellular hemoglobin (Hb), to the periventricular parenchyma and the cerebellum has been shown to be causal in the development of brain injury following GM-IVH. Furthermore, the damage has been described to be associated with the cytotoxic nature of extracellular Hb-metabolites. To date, there is no therapy available to prevent infants from developing either hydrocephalus or serious neurological disability. Mechanisms previously described to cause brain damage following GM-IVH, i.e., oxidative stress and Hb-metabolite toxicity, suggest that the free radical and heme scavenger α1-microglobulin (A1M) may constitute a potential neuroprotective intervention."
