The molecular determinants of this reduction are not very well understood yet, and their knowledge may help improving nanoparticle design. Here we address, using molecular dynamics simulations, the interactions of human serum albumin, the most abundant serum protein, with two promising hydrophilic polymers used for the coating of therapeutic nanoparticles, poly(ethylene-glycol) and poly-sarcosine. By simulating the protein immersed in a polymer-water mixture, we show that the two polymers have a very similar affinity for the protein surface, both in terms of the amount of polymer adsorbed and also in terms of the type of amino acids mainly involved in the interactions. We further analyze the kinetics of adsorption and how it affects the polymer conformations. Minor differences between the polymers are observed in the thickness of the adsorption layer, that are related to the different degree of flexibility of the two molecules. In comparison poly-alanine, an isomer of poly-sarcosine known to self-aggregate and induce protein aggregation, shows a significantly larger affinity for the protein surface than PEG and PSar, which we show to be related not to a different patterns of interactions with the protein surface, but to the different way the polymer interacts with water.",Role of growth factors and oxygen to limit hypertrophy and impact of high magnetic nanoparticles dose during stem cell chondrogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524668,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2018 12 25,"Due to an unmet clinical need of curative treatments for osteoarthritic patients, tissue engineering strategies that propose the development of cartilage tissue replacements from stem cells have emerged. Some of these strategies are based on the internalization of magnetic nanoparticles into stem cells to then initiate the chondrogenesis via magnetic compaction. A major difficulty is to drive the chondrogenic differentiation of the cells such as they produce an extracellular matrix free of hypertrophic collagen. An additional difficulty has to be overcome when nanoparticles are used, knowing that a high dose of nanoparticles can limit the chondrogenesis. We here propose a gene-based analysis of the effects of chemical factors (growth factors, hypoxia) on the chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells both with and without nanoparticles. We focus on the synthesis of two of the most important constituents present in the cartilaginous extracellular matrix (Collagen II and Aggrecan) and on the expression of collagen X, the signature of hypertrophic cartilage, in order to provide a quantitative index of the type of cartilage produced (i.e. hyaline, hypertrophic). We demonstrate that by applying specific environmental conditions, gene expression can be directed toward the production of hyaline cartilage, with limited hypertrophy. Besides, a combination of the growth factors IGF-1, TGF-Î²3, with a hypoxic conditioning remarkably reduced the impact of high nanoparticles concentration.",Identification of Differentially Expressed Profiles of Alzheimer's Disease Associated Circular RNAs in a Panax Notoginseng Saponins-Treated Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524667,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2018 12 25,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in AD pathogenesis. Thus, developing therapeutic candidates targeting circRNA may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Our previous studies showed that Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) could significantly prohibit the pathological progress of AD. However, the mechanisms by which PNS attenuates AD progression is still unclear. The present study shows that PNS may exhibit an ability to modulate the expression of AD-associated circRNAs. Specifically, PNS treatment leads to five circRNAs upregulation and two circRNAs downregulation, indicating that the therapeutic effect of PNS against AD may be associated with its role in the regulation of circRNA expression. Next, mmu_circRNA_013636 and mmu_circRNA_012180 were selected and GO and KEGG analyses were performed to further investigate the biological functions and potential mechanisms of these circRNAs. The results showed that the selected circRNAs were involved in AD-associated biological process and pathways, suggesting that these circRNAs may participate in AD pathogenesis. Collectively, our study indicates that the therapeutic effects of PNS on AD may be through modulating the expression of AD associated circRNAs and suggests that PNS is a potential circRNA-targeted agent against AD, which may provide useful resources for developing potential candidates targeting circRNAs against AD.",A New Application of Unsupervised Learning to Nighttime Sea Fog Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524666,Asia-Pacific journal of atmospheric sciences,2018 12 07,"This paper presents a nighttime sea fog detection algorithm incorporating unsupervised learning technique. The algorithm is based on data sets that combine brightness temperatures from the 3.7Â Î¼m and 10.8Â Î¼m channels of the meteorological imager (MI) onboard the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), with sea surface temperature from the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA). Previous algorithms generally employed threshold values including the brightness temperature difference between the near infrared and infrared. The threshold values were previously determined from climatological analysis or model simulation. Although this method using predetermined thresholds is very simple and effective in detecting low cloud, it has difficulty in distinguishing fog from stratus because they share similar characteristics of particle size and altitude. In order to improve this, the unsupervised learning approach, which allows a more effective interpretation from the insufficient information, has been utilized. The unsupervised learning method employed in this paper is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that is widely used in incomplete data problems. It identifies distinguishing features of the data by organizing and optimizing the data. This allows for the application of optimal threshold values for fog detection by considering the characteristics of a specific domain. The algorithm has been evaluated using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) vertical profile products, which showed promising results within a local domain with probability of detection (POD) of 0.753 and critical success index (CSI) of 0.477, respectively.",An adaptive dose-finding design based on both safety and immunologic responses in cancer clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524665,Statistics in biopharmaceutical research,2019 04 30,"Dose-finding in cancer clinical trials has been dominated by algorithmic designs on the principle that the highest tolerable dose is also the most effective dose. This assumption no longer applies to the biologic treatments that are characterized by different toxicity and/or efficacy profiles to the extent that the best therapeutic dose might be well below any dose that produces serious toxicity. As such, we propose a two-stage design with focus on immunotherapy trials, incorporating both safety and efficacy information. The 1st stage establishes the safety profile of each dose, with escalation decisions based on likelihood principles. Continuous immunologic outcomes are used to evaluate the relative efficacy of the doses. The 2nd stage employs an adaptive randomization to assign patients to doses showing higher efficacy. Safety is being continuously monitored throughout stage 2, where some doses may be 'closed' due to unacceptable toxicity. The proposed design is compared to the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design using percent dose allocation and estimation of outcomes under different scenarios. We show that by using an efficacy-driven adaptive randomization with safety constraints, the allocation distribution is skewed towards more efficacious doses, and thus limit the number of patients exposed to toxic or non-therapeutic doses."

To date, in the framework of an increasing interest about environmental conditions which could interact with genetic factors in ASD pathogenesis, many authors have stressed that changes in the intrauterine environment at different stages of pregnancy, such as those linked to maternal metabolic pathologies, may lead to long-term conditions in the newborn. In particular, a growing number of epidemiological studies have highlighted the role of obesity and maternal diabetes as a risk factor for developing both somatic and psychiatric disorders in humans, including ASD. While literature still fails in identifying specific etiopathological mechanisms, a growing body of evidence is available about the presence of a relationship between maternal immune dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the development of ASD in the offspring. In this framework, results from high-fat diet animal models about the role played by oxidative stress in shaping offspring neurodevelopment may help in clarifying the pathways through which maternal metabolic conditions are linked with ASD. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of literature about the effects of early life insults linked to oxidative stress which may be involved in ASD etiopathogenesis and how this relationship can be explained in biological terms.",Biological Effects of Tetrahydroxystilbene Glucoside: An Active Component of a Rhizome Extracted from Polygonum multiflorum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524653,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 01 18,"Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been widely used in the Orient as a tonic and antiaging agent. 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-Î²-D-glucoside (TSG, C20H22O9, FWâ=â406.38928) is one of the active components extracted from PM. TSG is an antioxidant agent, which exhibits remarkable antioxidative activities in vivo and in vitro. The antioxidant effect of TSG is achieved by its radical-scavenging effects. TSG can inhibit apoptosis and protect neuronal cells against injury through multifunctional cytoprotective pathways. TSG performs prophylactic and therapeutic activities against Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. It is also antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory. However, the mechanisms underlying these pharmacological activities are unclear. This study aimed at reviewing experimental studies and describing the effectiveness and possible mechanisms of TSG.",Metallothionein-Iâ+âII Reduces Oxidative Damage and Apoptosis after Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524652,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 01 18,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), some self-destructive mechanisms start leading to irreversible neurological deficits. It is known that oxidative stress and apoptosis play a major role in increasing damage after SCI. Metallothioneins I and II (MT) are endogenous peptides with known antioxidant, neuroprotective capacities. Taking advantage of those capacities, we administered exogenous MT to rats after SCI in order to evaluate the protective effects of MT on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LP), as markers of oxidative stress. The activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the number of annexin V and TUNEL-positive cells in the spinal cord tissue were also measured as markers of apoptosis. Rats were subjected to either sham surgery or SCI and received vehicle or two doses of MT (10âÎ¼g per rat) at 2 and 8âh after surgical procedure. The results showed a significant increase in levels of MT protein by effect of SCI and SCI plus treatment at 12âh, while at 24âh an increase of MT was observed only in the injury plus treatment group (p < 0.05). ROS production was decreased by effect of MT in lesioned tissue; likewise, we observed diminished LP levels by MT effect both in the sham group and in the group with SCI. Also, the results showed an increase in the activity of caspase-9 due to SCI, without changes by effect of MT, as compared to the sham group. Caspase-3 activity was increased by SCI, and again, MT treatment reduced this effect only at 24âh after injury. Finally, the results of the number of cells positive to annexin V and TUNEL showed a reduction due to MT treatment both at 24 and 72âh after the injury. With the findings of this work, we conclude that exogenously administered MT has antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects after SCI.","Parenteral Succinate Reduces Systemic ROS Production in Septic Rats, but It Does Not Reduce Creatinine Levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524651,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 01 18,"In sepsis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is increased. This process takes place mainly within the electron transport chain. ROS production is part of the pathophysiology of multiple organ failure in sepsis. Succinate yields Dihydroflavine-Adenine Dinucleotide (FADH2), which enters the chain through complex II, avoiding complex I, through which electrons are lost. The aim of this work is to determine if parenteral succinate reduces systemic ROS production and improves kidney function. Rats with cecal ligation and puncture were used as model of sepsis, and 4 groups were made: Control group; Succinate group, which only received parenteral succinate; Sepsis group; and Sepsis which received parenteral succinate. Systemic ROS are measured 24 hours after the procedure. Rats subjected to cecal puncture treated with succinate had less systemic ROS than Septic untreated rats (p = 0.007), while there were no differences in creatinine levels (p = 0.07). There was no correlation between creatinine and systemic ROS levels (p = 0.3). We concluded that parenteral succinate reduces ROS levels, but it does not reduce creatinine levels. Since there is no correlation between both levels, the processes would not be related.",Distribution of Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and Lipoprotein Phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) across Lipoprotein Subclasses in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524650,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 01 18,"Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) may exert an important protective role by preventing the oxidative transformation of high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively). The activity of both enzymes is influenced by lipidome and proteome of the lipoprotein carriers. T2DM typically presents significant changes in the molecular composition of the lipoprotein subclasses. Thus, it becomes relevant to understand the interaction of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 with the subspecies of HDL, LDL, and other lipoproteins in T2DM. Serum levels of PON1-arylesterase and PON1-lactonase and Lp-PLA2 activities and lipoprotein subclasses were measured in 202 nondiabetic subjects (controls) and 92 T2DM outpatients. Arylesterase, but not lactonase or Lp-PLA2 activities, was inversely associated with TD2M after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, and lipoprotein subclasses (odds ratioâ=â3.389, 95% confidence interval 1.069-14.756). Marked difference between controls and T2DM subjects emerged from the analyses of the associations of the three enzyme activities and lipoprotein subclasses. Arylesterase was independently related with large HDL-C and small intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) in controls while, along with lactonase, it was related with small low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C, all IDL-C subspecies, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) in T2DM (p < 0.05 for all). Concerning Lp-PLA2, there were significant relationships with small LDL-C, large IDL-C, and VLDL-C only among T2DM subjects. Our study showed that T2DM subjects have lower levels of PON1-arylesterase compared to controls and that T2DM occurrence may coincide with a shift of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 towards the more proatherogenic lipoprotein subclasses. The possibility of a link between the two observed phenomena requires further investigations.",Beneficial Effects Exerted by Paeonol in the Management of Atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524649,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 01 18,"Atherosclerosis, a chronic luminal stenosis disorder occurred in large and medium arteries, is the principle pathological basis of cardiovascular diseases with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide. In oriental countries, traditional Chinese medicine Cortex Moutan has been widely used for the treatment of atherosclerosis-related illnesses for thousands of years. Paeonol, a bioactive monomer extracted from Cortex Moutan, is an important pharmacological component responsible for the antiatherosclerotic effects. Numerous lines of findings have established that paeonol offers beneficial roles against the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions through inhibiting proatherogenic processes, such as endothelium damage, chronic inflammation, disturbance of lipid metabolism, uncontrolled oxidative stress, excessive growth, and mobilization of vascular smooth muscle cells as well as abnormality of platelet activation. Investigations identifying the atheroprotective effects of paeonol present substantial evidence for potential clinical application of paeonol as a therapeutic agent in atherosclerosis management. In this review, we summarize the antiatherosclerotic actions by which paeonol suppresses atherogenesis and provide newly insights into its atheroprotective mechanisms and the future clinical practice.",Simultaneous Assessment of Cardiac Inflammation and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling after Myocardial Infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524648,Circulation.

This study tests the independent and interacting roles of family, peer and school relationships in predicting substance use, subjective wellbeing and mental health symptoms among 11-16Â year olds in Wales. It presents cross-sectional analyses of the 2013 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey, completed by 9055 young people aged 11-16Â years. Multilevel logistic regression analyses are used to test associations of family communication, family support, relationships with school staff, school peer connectedness, and support from friends, with tobacco use, cannabis use, alcohol use, subjective wellbeing and mental health symptoms. Positive relationships with family and school staff were consistently associated with better outcomes. Support from friends was associated with higher use of all substances, while higher school peer connectedness was associated with better subjective wellbeing and mental health. Better relationships with school staff were most strongly associated with positive subjective wellbeing, and fewer mental health symptoms where pupils reported less family support. Support from friends was associated with higher cannabis use and worse mental health among pupils with lower family support. Relationships with family and school staff may be important in protecting young people against substance use, and improving wellbeing and mental health. Interventions focused on student-staff relationships may be important for young people with less family support. Interventions based on peer support should be mindful of potential harmful effects for pupils with less support from family.",A Child Health Index for Sweden's 290 Municipalities: A System of Indicators and Indices for Monitoring Children's Health on the Local Level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524518,Child indicators research,2018 12 17,"This broad survey of children's health and wellbeing in Sweden's 290 municipalities converts freely available national data to a set of 13 high quality indicators, and makes local surveillance and comparisons possible. Combining the indicators, using equal weights, into relevant domains as 5 sub-indices and then again into one summary index provides one index for the great picture, sub-indices for the various domains of child health and separate indicators for the detailed study of the basic components. This creates a simplified tool for decision makers and professionals in their task to monitor children's health on the local level. Children's health in the Swedish municipalities is generally good, with a mean Child Health Index of 88 out of 100, ranging from 81 to 93. Children in economically disadvantaged municipalities have, with few exceptions, more health problems and worse preconditions for health. The indicators Socio-economic standard, Tobacco in utero, Smoking households and Teenage abortions explain most of the municipality variations. But the broader range of indicators gives more information and is a better tool to consider strengths and weaknesses for each municipality, and is thus more useful for policy-oriented efforts. The real value of this kind of monitoring lies in a succession of comparable surveys. The generous, free and easily available data are not available in all other countries, but matters such as philosophy and design, indicator definitions and index constructions might be considered in other regions looking for ways to monitor children's health and wellbeing on local levels.",Health and Its Relationship with Residential Relocations of Older People to Institutions versus to Independent Dwellings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524517,Journal of population ageing,2018 12 17,"Research into older people's relocations to independent dwellings has largely remained separate from research into moves to institutions. Yet, both types of moves could be a response to health problems and to a certain extent they could be substitutes for each other. Using Litwak and Longino's model of moves of older people, this study assesses the extent to which three commonly used health measures (limitations in activities of daily living [ADL], self-rated health, and the prevalence of [limiting] chronic conditions) predict older people's moves to subsidized care institutions and elsewhere, in one multinomial logistic regression model. The data were derived from the POLS survey for the Netherlands (NÂ =Â 8306) enriched with administrative data on subsequent moves. In line with Litwak and Longino's model, the findings indicate that older people's moves to institutions were more likely among those with more severe health problems, whereas moves elsewhere were more likely among those with moderate health problems. Among the three investigated health measures, limitations in ADL had the strongest predictive value, and was the only one for which the difference in effect between relocations to care institutions and relocations elsewhere was statistically significant.",Explaining Variations in Mindfulness Levels in Daily Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524516,Mindfulness,2018 12 17,"Despite the apparent benefits of being mindful, people are often not very mindful. There seem to be forces that drive people toward as well as away from mindfulness. These forces are conceptualised in terms of competition for scarce attentional resources. To explore these forces and to test this framework, an experience sampling study was performed among people with an explicit intention to be mindful and an ongoing practice to examine concurrent associations between state mindfulness and daily life experiences that may affect it. Participants (Nâ=â29, 1012 observations) filled out questions on momentary experiences at semi-random intervals, five times a day, over a period of 7 to 10Â days. Predictors of within-person variations in awareness of Present Moment Experience (PME) and non-reactivity to PME were examined using multilevel analyses. Participants were more aware of PME when they had an activated intention to be mindful and when they felt good, and not very busy or hurried, and were not involved in social interaction. They were more reactive to PME when they experienced unpleasant affect, and when they were hurried or tired. An activated intention to be mindful was also associated with an increased tendency to analyse PME. Experiencing threat was associated with increased reactivity, but not with decreased awareness. Our study generally supports the idea that competition for attention can be a fruitful framework to describe mechanisms behind being or not being mindful.",Differences in Functional Connectivity of the Insula Between Brain Wave Vibration inÂ Meditators and Non-meditators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524515,Mindfulness,2018 12 17,"The majority of meditation involves focusing attention on internal events or sensations and becoming aware of emotions. The insula cortex, through a functional connection with the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions, plays a key role in integrating external sensory information with internal bodily state signals and emotional awareness. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the resting-state functional connectivity of the insula with other brain regions in meditation practitioners and control subjects. Thirty-five Brain Wave Vibration meditation practitioners and 33 controls without meditation experience were included in this study. All subjects underwent 4.68-min resting-state functional scanning runs using magnetic resonance imaging. The anterior and posterior insulae were chosen as seed regions for the functional connectivity map. Meditation practitioners showed significantly greater insula-related functional connectivity in the thalamus, caudate, middle frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus than did controls. Control subjects demonstrated greater functional connectivity with the posterior insula in the parahippocampal gyrus. Our findings suggest that the practice of Brain Wave Vibration meditation may be associated with functional differences in regions related to focused attention, executive control, and emotional awareness and regulation.","The Effects of an Online Mindfulness Intervention on Perceived Stress, Depression and Anxiety in a Non-clinical Sample: A Randomised Waitlist Control Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524514,Mindfulness,2018 12 17,"Mindfulness interventions have been shown to be effective for health and wellbeing, and delivering mindfulness programmes online may increase accessibility and reduce waiting times and associated costs; however, research assessing the effectiveness of online interventions is lacking. We sought to: (1) assess the effects of an online mindfulness intervention on perceived stress, depression and anxiety; (2) assess different facets of mindfulness (i.e. acting with awareness, describing, non-judging and non-reacting) as mechanisms of change and (3) assess whether the effect of the intervention was maintained over time. The sample was comprised of 118 adults (female, nâ=â95) drawn from the general population. Using a randomised waitlist control design, participants were randomised to either an intervention (INT) or waitlist control (WLC) group. Participants completed the online intervention, with the WLC group starting after a 6-week waitlist period. Participants completed measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and perceived stress (PSS-10) at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Participants who completed the mindfulness intervention (nâ=â60) reported significantly lower levels of perceived stress (dâ=â-â1.25 [-â1.64, -â0.85]), anxiety (dâ=â-â1.09 [-â1.47, -â0.98]) and depression (dâ=â-â1.06 [-â1.44, -â0.67]), when compared with waitlist control participants (nâ=â58), and these effects were maintained at follow-up. The effect of the intervention was primarily explained by increased levels of non-judging. This study provides support for online mindfulness interventions and furthers our understanding with regards to how mindfulness interventions exert their positive effects.",Testing for an Effect of a Mindfulness Induction on Child Executive Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524513,Mindfulness,2018 12 17,"Several sessions of mindfulness practice can exert positive gains for child executive functions (EF); however, the evidence for effects of a mindfulness induction, on EF for adults, is mixed and this effect has not been tested in children. The immediate effect of an age appropriate 3-min mindfulness induction on EF of children aged 4-7Â years was tested. Participants (NÂ =â156) were randomly assigned to a mindfulness induction or dot-to-dot activity comparison group before completing four measures of EF. A composite score for EF was calculated from summed z scores of the four EF measures. A difference at baseline in behavioural difficulties between the mindfulness induction and comparison group meant that data was analysed using a hierarchical regression. The mindfulness induction resulted in higher average performance for the composite EF score (Mâ=Â 0.12) compared to the comparison group (MÂ =â-â0.05). Behavioural difficulties significantly predicted 5.3% of the variance in EF performance but participation in the mindfulness or comparison induction did not significantly affect EF. The non-significant effect of a mindfulness induction to exert immediate effects on EF fits within broader evidence reporting mixed effects when similar experimental designs have been used with adults. The findings are discussed with consideration of the extent to which methodological differences may account for these mixed effects and how mindfulness inductions fit within broader theoretical and empirical understanding of the effects of mindfulness on EF.",Meditation-Induced Near-Death Experiences: a 3-Year Longitudinal Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524512,Mindfulness,2018 12 17,"Near-death experiences (NDEs) are life transformational events that are increasingly being subjected to empirical research. However, to date, no study has investigated the phenomenon of a meditation-induced near-death experience (MI-NDE) that is referred to in ancient Buddhist texts. Given that some advanced Buddhist meditators can induce NDEs at a pre-planned point in time, the MI-NDE may make NDEs more empirically accessible and thus advance understanding into the psychology of death-related processes. The present study recruited 12 advanced Buddhist meditators and compared the MI-NDE against two other meditation practices (i.e. that acted as control conditions) in the same participant group. Changes in the content and profundity of the MI-NDE were assessed longitudinally over a 3-year period. Findings demonstrated that compared to the control conditions, the MI-NDE prompted significantly greater pre-post increases in NDE profundity, mystical experiences and non-attachment. Furthermore, participants demonstrated significant increases in NDE profundity across the 3-year study period. Findings from an embedded qualitative analysis (using grounded theory) demonstrated that participants (i) were consciously aware of experiencing NDEs, (ii) retained volitional control over the content and duration of NDEs and (iii) elicited a rich array of non-worldly encounters and spiritual experiences. In addition to providing corroborating evidence in terms of the content of a ""regular"" (i.e. non-meditation-induced) NDE, novel NDE features identified in the present study indicate that there exist unexplored and/or poorly understood dimensions to NDEs. Furthermore, the study indicates that it would be feasible-including ethically feasible-for future research to recruit advanced meditators in order to assess real-time changes in neurological activity during NDEs.",Towards photon radiotherapy treatment planning with high Z nanoparticle radiosensitisation agents: the Relative Biological Effective Dose (RBED) framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524511,Cancer nanotechnology,2018 12 17,"A novel treatment planning framework, the Relative Biological Effective Dose (RBED), for high Z nanoparticle (NP)-enhanced photon radiotherapy is developed and tested in silico for the medical exemplar of neoadjuvant (preoperative) breast cancer MV photon radiotherapy. Two different treatment scenarios, conventional and high Z NP enhanced, were explored with a custom Geant4 application that was developed to emulate the administration of a single 2 Gy fraction as part of a 50 Gy radiotherapy treatment plan. It was illustrated that there was less than a 1% difference in the dose deposition throughout the standard and high Z NP-doped adult female phantom. Application of the RBED framework found that the extent of possible biological response with high Z NP doping was great than expected via the dose deposition alone. It is anticipated that this framework will assist the scientific community in future high Z NP-enhanced in-silico, pre-clinical and clinical trials."

This was a cross-sectional pilot study of 40 patients with XP. All patients had healthy-looking retinae and optic nerves on slit lamp biomicroscopy, and subtle or no neurological deficits. Patients were divided into two groups based on the known tendency for neurodegeneration associated with certain XP complementation groups. A third control group was obtained from a normative database. Using SD-OCT, we compared peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) and macular thickness between the groups. XP patients with a known tendency for neurodegeneration were found to have a statistically significant reduction in both pRNFL (pÂ <Â 0.01) and macular thickness (pÂ <Â 0.001) compared with healthy controls. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between pRNFL and macular thickness in XP patients not expected to develop neurodegeneration compared to the same control group. When both XP groups were compared, a statistically significant reduction in total pRNFL (pÂ =Â 0.02) and macular thickness (pÂ =Â 0.002) was found in XP patients predisposed to neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that pRNFL and macular thickness are reduced in XP patients with a known tendency for neurodegeneration, even before any marked neurological deficits become manifest.

There is increasing evidence, however, that both the rate of age-related functional decline and the later-life health status can be programmed during early development. The central role of epigenetic mechanisms (methylation of DNA, histone modifications and regulation by non-coding RNAs) in mediating these long-term effects has been elucidated. Both rate and direction of age-associated change of epigenetic patterns (""epigenetic drift"") were shown to be largely dependent on early-life environmental conditions. Inter-individual divergences in epigenetic profiles may arise following the stochastic errors in maintaining epigenetic marks, but they may also be adaptively mediated by specific environmental cues. Recent cohort studies indicate that ticking rate of epigenetic clock, estimated by a DNA methylation-based methods, may be developmentally adjusted, and that individual's discrepancies among epigenetic and chronological age would be likely programmed early in development. In this Perspective article, recent findings suggesting the importance of early-life determinants for life-course dynamics of epigenetic drift are summarized and discussed.",Borders of Cis-Regulatory DNA Sequences Preferentially Harbor the Divergent Transcription Factor Binding Motifs in the Human Genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524473,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 17,"Changes in cis-regulatory DNA sequences and transcription factor (TF) repertoires provide major sources of phenotypic diversity that shape the evolution of gene regulation in eukaryotes. The DNA-binding specificities of TFs may be diversified or produce new variants in different eukaryotic species. However, it is currently unclear how various levels of divergence in TF DNA-binding specificities or motifs became introduced into the cis-regulatory DNA regions of the genome over evolutionary time. Here, we first estimated the evolutionary divergence levels of TF binding motifs and quantified their occurrence at DNase I-hypersensitive sites. Results from our in silico motif scan and experimentally derived chromatin immunoprecipitation (TF-ChIP) show that the divergent motifs tend to be introduced in the edges of cis-regulatory regions, which is probably accompanied by the expansion of the accessible core of promoter-associated regulatory elements during evolution. We also find that the genes neighboring the expanded cis-regulatory regions with the most divergent motifs are associated with functions like development and morphogenesis. Accordingly, we propose that the accumulation of divergent motifs in the edges of cis-regulatory regions provides a functional mechanism for the evolution of divergent regulatory circuits.","Prognostic Analysis of Limited Resection Versus Lobectomy in Stage IA Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry Database.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524472,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 17,"Objective: The prognostic analysis of limited resection vs. lobectomy in stage IA small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains scarce. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (SEER) database, we identified patients who were diagnosed with pathological stage IA (T1a/bN0M0) SCLC from 2004 to 2013. The overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) rates of patients with different treatment schemes were compared in stratification analyses. Univariable and multivariable analyses were also performed to identify the significant predictors of OS and LCSS. Results: In total, we extracted 491 pathological stage IA SCLC patients, 106 (21.6%) of whom received lobectomy, 70 (14.3%) received sublobar resection and 315 (64.1%) received non-surgical treatment, respectively. There were significant differences among the groups based on different treatment schemes in OS (log-rank p < 0.0001) and LCSS (log-rank p < 0.0001). Furthermore, in subgroup analyses, we did not identify any differences between sublober resection group and lobectomy group in OS (log-rank p = 0.14) or LCSS (log-rank p = 0.4565). Patients with four or more lymph node dissection had better prognosis. Multivariable analyses revealed age, laterality, tumor location, and N number were still significant predictors of OS, whereas age, tumor location, and N number were significant predictors of LCSS. Conclusion: Surgery is an important component of multidisciplinary treatment for stage IA SCLC patients and sublober resection is not inferior to lobectomy for the specific patients.",Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations Underlie Oligodendroglia Susceptibility and White Matter Etiology in Psychiatric Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524471,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 17,"Numerous genetic risk loci are found to associate with major neuropsychiatric disorders represented by schizophrenia. The pathogenic roles of genetic risk loci in psychiatric diseases are further complicated by the association with cell lineage- and/or developmental stage-specific epigenetic alterations. Besides aberrant assembly and malfunction of neuronal circuitry, an increasing volume of discoveries clearly demonstrate impairment of oligodendroglia and disruption of white matter integrity in psychiatric diseases. Nonetheless, whether and how genetic risk factors and epigenetic dysregulations for neuronal susceptibility may affect oligodendroglia is largely unknown. In this mini-review, we will discuss emerging evidence regarding the functional interplay between genetic risk loci and epigenetic factors, which may underlie compromised oligodendroglia and myelin development in neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcriptional and epigenetic factors are the major aspects affected in oligodendroglia. Moreover, multiple disease susceptibility genes are connected by epigenetically modulated transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Oligodendroglia specific complex molecular orchestra may explain how distinct risk factors lead to the common clinical expression of white matter pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Dynamical Modeling of the Core Gene Network Controlling Flowering Suggests Cumulative Activation From the FLOWERING LOCUS T Gene Homologs in Chickpea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524469,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 17,"Initiation of flowering moves plants from vegetative to reproductive development. The time when this transition happens (flowering time), an important indicator of productivity, depends on both endogenous and environmental factors. The core genetic regulatory network canalizing the flowering signals to the decision to flower has been studied extensively in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and has been shown to preserve its main regulatory blocks in other species. It integrates activation from the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene or its homologs to the flowering decision expressed as high expression of the meristem identity genes, including AP1. We elaborated a dynamical model of this flowering gene regulatory network and applied it to the previously published expression data from two cultivars of domesticated chickpea (Cicer arietinum), obtained for two photoperiod durations. Due to a large number of free parameters in the model, we used an ensemble approach analyzing the model solutions at many parameter sets that provide equally good fit to data. Testing several alternative hypotheses about regulatory roles of the five FT homologs present in chickpea revealed no preference in segregating individual FT copies as singled-out activators with their own regulatory parameters, thus favoring the hypothesis that the five genes possess similar regulatory properties and provide cumulative activation in the network. The analysis reveals that different levels of activation from AP1 can explain a small difference observed in the expression of the two homologs of the repressor gene TFL1. Finally, the model predicts highly reduced activation between LFY and AP1, thus suggesting that this regulatory block is not conserved in chickpea and needs other mechanisms. Overall, this study provides the first attempt to quantitatively test the flowering time gene network in chickpea based on data-driven modeling.",Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus-Associated Genetic Variants Contribute to Overlapping Immune Regulatory Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524468,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 17,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 60 risk regions across the human genome, marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which confer genetic predisposition to T1D. There is increasing evidence that disease-associated SNPs can alter gene expression through spatial interactions that involve distal loci, in a tissue- and development-specific manner. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) genome organization data to identify genes that physically co-localized with DNA regions that contained T1D-associated SNPs in the nucleus. Analysis of these SNP-gene pairs using the Genotype-Tissue Expression database identified a subset of SNPs that significantly affected gene expression. We identified 246 spatially regulated genes including HLA-DRB1, LAT, MICA, BTN3A2, CTLA4, CD226, NOTCH1, TRIM26, PTEN, TYK2, CTSH, and FLRT3, which exhibit tissue-specific effects in multiple tissues. We observed that the T1D-associated variants interconnect through networks that form part of the immune regulatory pathways, including immune-cell activation, cytokine signaling, and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). Our results implicate T1D-associated variants in tissue and cell-type specific regulatory networks that contribute to pancreatic beta cell inflammation and destruction, adaptive immune signaling, and immune-cell proliferation and activation. A number of other regulatory changes we identified are not typically considered to be central to the pathology of T1D. Collectively, our data represent a novel resource for the hypothesis-driven development of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic interventions in T1D.",SmbHLH37 Functions Antagonistically With SmMYC2 in Regulating Jasmonate-Mediated Biosynthesis of Phenolic Acids in Salvia miltiorrhiza.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524467,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 17,"Jasmonates (JAs) are integral to various defense responses and induce biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. MYC2, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF), acts as a transcriptional activator of JA signaling. MYC2 is repressed by the JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins in the absence of JA, but de-repressed by the protein complex SCFCOI1 on perception of JA. We previously reported that overexpression of SmMYC2 promotes the production of salvianolic acid B (Sal B) in Salvia miltiorrhiza. However, the responsible molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we showed that SmMYC2 binds to and activates the promoters of its target genes SmTAT1, SmPAL1, and SmCYP98A14 to activate Sal B accumulations. SmbHLH37, a novel bHLH gene significantly up-regulated by constitutive expression of SmMYC2, was isolated from S. miltiorrhiza for detailed functional characterization. SmbHLH37 forms a homodimer and interacts with SmJAZ3/8. Overexpression of SmbHLH37 substantially decreased yields of Sal B. SmbHLH37 binds to the promoters of its target genes SmTAT1 and SmPAL1 and blocks their expression to suppress the pathway for Sal B biosynthesis. These results indicate that SmbHLH37 negatively regulates JA signaling and functions antagonistically with SmMYC2 in regulating Sal B biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza.",Identification of New Sources of Resistance to Wheat Stem Rust in Aegilops spp. in the Tertiary Genepool of Wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524466,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 17,"Recent stem rust epidemics in eastern Africa and elsewhere demonstrated that wheat stem rust is a re-emerging disease posing a threat to wheat production worldwide. The cultivated wheat gene pool has a narrow genetic base for resistance to virulent races, such as races in the Ug99 race group. Wild relatives of wheat are a tractable source of stem rust resistance genes. Aegilops species in the tertiary genepool have not been exploited to any great extent as a source of stem rust resistance. We evaluated 1,422 accessions of Aegilops spp. for resistance to three highly virulent races (TTKSK, TRTTF, and TTTTF) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Species studied include Ae. biuncialis, Ae. caudata, Ae. comosa, Ae. cylindrica, Ae. geniculata, Ae. neglecta, Ae. peregrina, Ae. triuncialis, and Ae. umbellulata that do not share common genomes with cultivated wheat. High frequencies of resistance were observed as 977 (68.8%), 927 (65.2%), and 850 (59.8%) accessions exhibited low infection types to races TTKSK, TTTTF, and TRTTF, respectively. Contingency table analyses showed strong association for resistance to different races in several Aegilops spp., indicating that for a given species, the resistance genes effective against multiple races. Inheritance studies in selected accessions showed that resistance to race TTKSK is simply inherited."

Herein, a PAA mutant, paa1019, was identified among the progeny of an elite indica maintainer rice line Yixiang 1B (YXB) mutagenized population obtained using ethyl methyl sulfonate. The abortion rate of spikelets in paa1019 was observed up to 60%. Genetic mapping combined with Mutmap analysis revealed that LOC_Os03g20380 harbored a single-bp substitution (C to T) that altered its transcript length. This gene encodes calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinase 31 (OsCIPK31) localized into the cytoplasm, and is preferentially expressed in transport tissues of rice. Complementation of paa1019 by transferring the open reading frame of LOC_Os03g20380 from YXB reversed the mutant phenotype, and conversely, gene editing by knocking out of OsCIPK31 in YXB results in PAA phenotype. Our results support that OsCIPK31 plays an important role in panicle development. We found that dysregulation is caused by the disruption of OsCIPK31 function due to excessive accumulation of ROS, which ultimately leads to cell death in rice panicle. OsCIPK31 and MAPK pathway might have a synergistic effect to lead ROS accumulation in response to stresses. Meanwhile the PAA distribution is related to IAA hormone accumulation in the panicle. Our study provides an understanding of the role of OsCIPK31 in panicle development by responding to various stresses and phytohormones.",Advanced Proteomic Approaches to Elucidate Somatic Embryogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524454,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 17,"Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a cell differentiation process by which a somatic cell changes its genetic program and develops into an embryonic cell. Investigating this process with various explant sources in vitro has allowed us to trace somatic embryo development from germination to plantlets and has led to the generation of new technologies, including genetic transformation, endangered species conservation, and synthetic seed production. A transcriptome data comparison from different stages of the developing somatic embryo has revealed a complex network controlling the somatic cell's fate, suggesting that an interconnected network acts at the protein level. Here, we discuss the current progress on SE using proteomic-based data, focusing on changing patterns of proteins during the establishment of the somatic embryo. Despite the advanced proteomic approaches available so far, deciphering how the somatic embryo is induced is still in its infancy. The new proteomics techniques that lead to the quantification of proteins with different abundances during the induction of SE are opening this area of study for the first time. These quantitative differences can elucidate the different pathways involved in SE induction. We envisage that the application of these proteomic technologies can be pivotal to identifying proteins critical to the process of SE, demonstrating the cellular localization, posttranslational modifications, and turnover protein events required to switch from a somatic cell to a somatic embryo cell and providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SE. This work will help to develop biotechnological strategies for mass production of quality crop material.",Mango Firmness Modeling as Affected by Transport and Ethylene Treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524453,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 17,"More and more, tropical fruit are subjected to accelerated ripening at receiving markets until ""ready to eat."" We propose a kinetic model that incorporates the effects of temperature and ethylene on the firmness behavior of ""Keitt"" and ""Kent"" mangoes. Stiffness of individual mangoes, as measured by the acoustic firmness tester, was measured repeatedly over time. The firmness model assumes fixed levels of ethylene, established after the climacteric peak, that steadily induces production of softening enzymes that subsequently denaturalize. The initial level of these enzymes is assumed to be zero due to either the tree factor for freshly harvested mangoes, or due to chilling injury for reefer transported mangoes. The kinetic parameter set for ""Keitt"" mangoes was estimated based on a Spanish batch, freshly harvested and ripened under dynamic temperature scenarios, combined with a reefer transported Brazilian batch stored at four constant temperatures. Firmness data from reefer transported batches, from Brazil, Ivory Coast and Mali, stored at four constant temperatures were used to estimate a set of kinetic parameters for the ""Kent"" mangoes. Only a partial set of ""Kent"" kinetic parameters could be established due to the often already advanced stage of softening at the time of arrival. The effect of ethylene was investigated by applying external ethylene levels, varying from 0 to 100 Î¼L L-1. The effect of external application of ethylene was modeled by estimating EF, the ethylene factor, being a reflection of the internal ethylene level and ethylene sensitivity. The effect of ethylene application on softening was sometimes huge. For an Israeli ""Keitt"" batch a fifty times higher EF was found when the firmness behavior of low- (without ethylene application) and high temperature (with ethylene application) stored sub-batches were compared. However, this effect was sometimes also small, especially for reefer transported mangoes. For commercial application, a reliable prediction of the time until ""ready to eat"" is not possible because of the current inability to assess EF. Nevertheless, the proposed model described mango softening accurately, irrespective of the sourcing area and includes the effects of storage temperature and ethylene application.",Genetic Contribution of Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank) to Heat Tolerance of Bread Wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524452,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 20,"Rising global temperatures cause substantial yield losses in many wheat growing environments. Emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank), one of the first wheat species domesticated, carries significant variation for tolerance to abiotic stresses. This study identified new genetic variability for high-temperature tolerance in hexaploid progeny derived from crosses with emmer wheat. Eight hexaploid and 11 tetraploid parents were recombined in 43 backcross combinations using the hexaploid as the recurrent parent. A total of 537 emmer-based hexaploid lines were developed by producing approximately 10 doubled haploids on hexaploid like BC1F1 progeny and subsequent selection for hexaploid morphology. These materials and 17 commercial cultivars and hexaploid recurrent parents were evaluated under two times of sowing in the field, in 2014-2016. The materials were genotyped using a 90K SNP platform and these data were used to estimate the contribution of emmer wheat to the progeny. Significant phenotypic and genetic variation for key agronomical traits including grain yield, TKW and screenings was observed. Many of the emmer derived lines showed improved performance under heat stress (delayed sowing) compared with parents and commercial cultivars. Emmer derived lines were the highest yielding material in both sowing dates. The emmer wheat parent contributed between 1 and 44% of the genome of the derived lines. Emmer derived lines with superior kernel weight and yield generally had a greater genetic contribution from the emmer parent compared to those with lower trait values. The study showed that new genetic variation for key traits such as yield, kernel weight and screenings can be introduced to hexaploid wheat from emmer wheat. These genetic resources should be explored more systematically to stabilize grain yield and quality in a changing climate.",Soil-Plant Indices Help Explain Legume Response to Crop Rotation in a Semiarid Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524451,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 17,"Crop productivity is typically affected by various soil-plant factors systematically as they influence plant photosynthesis, soil fertility, and root systems. However, little is known about how the productivity of legumes is related to crop rotation systems. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of rotation systems on legume productivity and the relationships among legume productivity and soil-plant factors. Three annual legumes - chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), were included in various diversified rotation systems and compared with legume monoculture in the 8-year rotation study. Soil N and water conditions, and canopy and root systems were evaluated at the end of 8-year rotation in the semiarid Canadian prairies. Results showed that diversified rotation systems improved leaf greenness by 4%, shoot biomass by 25%, nodule biomass by 44%, and seed yield by 95% for chickpea and pea, but such effects were not found for lentil. Pea monocultures increased root rot severity by threefold compared with diversified rotations, and chickpea monoculture increased shoot rot severity by 23%, root rot severity by 96% and nodule damage by 219%. However, all the legume monocultures improved soil N accumulation by an average 38% compared to diversified systems. Pea and chickpea displayed considerable sensitivity to plant biotic stresses, whereas lentil productivity had a larger dependence on initial soil N content. The 8-year study concludes that the rotational effect on legume productivity varies with legume species, the frequency of a legume appearing in the rotation, and the integration of relevant soil and plant indices.",Chromatin Accessibility and Interactions in the Transcriptional Regulation of T Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524449,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"During T cell differentiation and activation, specific stimuli, and a network of transcription factors (TFs) are involved in orchestrating chromatin accessibility, establishing enhancer-promoter interactions, and regulating gene expression. Over the past few years, there have been new insights into how chromatin interactions coordinate differentiation during T cell development and how regulatory elements are programmed to allow T cells to differentially respond to distinct stimuli. In this review, we discuss recent advances related to the roles of TFs in establishing the regulatory chromatin landscapes that orchestrate T cell development and differentiation. In particular, we focus on the role of TFs (e.g., TCF-1, BCL11B, PU.1, STAT3, STAT5, AP-1, and IRF4) in mediating chromatin accessibility and interactions and in regulating gene expression in T cells, including gene expression that is dependent on IL-2 and IL-21. Furthermore, we discuss the state of knowledge on enhancer-promoter interactions and how autoimmune disease risk variants can be linked to molecular functions of putative target genes.","Signatures of T and B Cell Development, Functional Responses and PD-1 Upregulation After HCMV Latent Infections and Reactivations in Nod.Rag.Gamma Mice Humanized With Cord Blood CD34+ Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524448,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) latency is typically harmless but reactivation can be largely detrimental to immune compromised hosts. We modeled latency and reactivation using a traceable HCMV laboratory strain expressing the Gaussia luciferase reporter gene (HCMV/GLuc) in order to interrogate the viral modulatory effects on the human adaptive immunity. Humanized mice with long-term (more than 17 weeks) steady human T and B cell immune reconstitutions were infected with HCMV/GLuc and 7 weeks later were further treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to induce viral reactivations. Whole body bio-luminescence imaging analyses clearly differentiated mice with latent viral infections vs. reactivations. Foci of vigorous viral reactivations were detectable in liver, lymph nodes and salivary glands. The number of viral genome copies in various tissues increased upon reactivations and were detectable in sorted human CD14+, CD169+, and CD34+ cells. Compared with non-infected controls, mice after infections and reactivations showed higher thymopoiesis, systemic expansion of Th, CTL, Treg, and Tfh cells and functional antiviral T cell responses. Latent infections promoted vast development of memory CD4+ T cells while reactivations triggered a shift toward effector T cells expressing PD-1. Further, reactivations prompted a marked development of B cells, maturation of IgG+ plasma cells, and HCMV-specific antibody responses. Multivariate statistical methods were employed using T and B cell immune phenotypic profiles obtained with cells from several tissues of individual mice. The data was used to identify combinations of markers that could predict an HCMV infection vs. reactivation status. In spleen, but not in lymph nodes, higher frequencies of effector CD4+ T cells expressing PD-1 were among the factors most suited to distinguish HCMV reactivations from infections. These results suggest a shift from a T cell dominated immune response during latent infections toward an exhausted T cell phenotype and active humoral immune response upon reactivations. In sum, this novel in vivo humanized model combined with advanced analyses highlights a dynamic system clearly specifying the immunological spatial signatures of HCMV latency and reactivations. These signatures can be merged as predictive biomarker clusters that can be applied in the clinical translation of new therapies for the control of HCMV reactivation.",TCR Repertoire as a Novel Indicator for Immune Monitoring and Prognosis Assessment of Patients With Cervical Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524447,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"There is increasing evidence that deep sequencing-based T cell repertoire can sever as a biomarker of immune response in cancer patients; however, the characteristics of T cell repertoire including diversity and similarity, as well as its prognostic significance in patients with cervical cancer (CC) remain unknown. In this study, we applied a high throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing method to characterize the T cell repertoires of peripheral blood samples from 25 CC patients, 30 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients and 20 healthy women for understanding the immune alterations during the cervix carcinogenesis. In addition, we also explored the signatures of TCR repertoires in the cervical tumor tissues and paired sentinel lymph nodes from 16 CC patients and their potential value in predicting the prognosis of patients. Our results revealed that the diversity of circulating TCR repertoire gradually decreased during the cervix carcinogenesis and progression, but the circulating TCR repertoires in CC patients were more similar to CIN patients than healthy women. Interestingly, several clonotypes uniquely detected in CC patients tended to share similar CDR3 motifs, which differed from those observed in CIN patients. In addition, the TCR repertoire diversity in sentinel lymphatic nodes from CC patients was higher than in tumor tissues. More importantly, less clonotypes in TCR repertoire of sentinel lymphatic node was associated with the poor prognosis of the patients. Overall, our findings suggested that TCR repertoire might be a potential indicator of immune monitoring and a biomarker for predicting the prognosis of CC patients. Although functional studies of T cell populations are clearly required, this study have expanded our understanding of T cell immunity during the development of CC and provided an experimental basis for further studies on its pathogenesis and immunotherapy.","Death Associated to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST8 Infection in Two Dolphins Maintained Under Human Care, Italy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524446,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"The present study describes the isolation of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from respiratory tract of 2 dolphins of different origin, a stranded juvenile Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) and a captive born common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) calf, which died in the same institution at 1-month distance from the other. A complete microbiological and genetic investigation confirmed the presence of MRSA clone-complex 8, sequence type (ST) 8, spa-type t008 in both individuals. This strain differs from the one previously reported in walruses and dolphins and has never been described in dolphins before, but it is randomly isolated from Italian human patients. Vertical transmission of the infection may also occurs in other species and considering the description and location of the pathological lesions, this seems to be the most likely route of transmission implied in the young bottlenose dolphin. Staphylococcus aureus is known as an opportunistic agent, usually secondary to other pathogens, but its multiple antibiotic resistance and its zoonotic implications suggest a thorough and strict application of animal management hygiene protocols.",The c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN Axis Tunes PI3K Activity to Control Expression of Recombination Activating Genes in Early B Cell Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524445,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 07,"Appropriate PI3K signals generated by the antigen receptor are essential to promote B cell development. Regulation of recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 expression is one key process that is mediated by PI3K to ensure developmental progression and selection. When PI3K signals are too high or too low, expression of RAGs does not turn off and B cell development is impaired or blocked. Yet, the mechanism which tunes PI3K activity to control RAG expression during B cell development in the bone marrow is unknown. Recently we showed that a c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis regulates PI3K activity for positive and negative selection of immature B cells. Here, we show that the c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis tunes PI3K activity to control the expression of RAGs in proB cells. Using different genetically engineered mouse models we show that impaired function of the c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis alters the PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 pathway to result in dis-regulated expression of RAG and a block in B cell development. Studies using 38c-13 B lymphoma cells, where RAGs are constitutively expressed, suggest that this regulatory effect is mediated post-translationally through Foxo1."

Accordingly, the present study aimed to assess the modulatory effects of dietary methionine on the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) immune status, inflammatory response and disease resistance to Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (Phdp). For this purpose, fish were randomly distributed in three independent groups (three replicates per group) and each was fed the corresponding diet: a control diet (CTRL) formulated to meet the established amino acid requirements for the species; a diet supplemented with methionine at 0.5% of feed weight relative to the CTRL diet (8.2% of methionine concentration above CTRL); and one supplemented with methionine at 1% of feed weight to the CTRL diet (11.8% of methionine concentration above CTRL). To evaluate the immune status of fish fed with each of the diets before being submitted to bacterial infection fish were sampled from each group at 2 and 4 weeks after the beginning of feeding. Non-sampled fish were injected intraperitoneally with Phdp (5 Ã 103 cfu/fish) at 4 weeks after initiation of feeding and the inflammatory response (at 4, 24, and 48 h post-infection) and survival (lasting 21 days post-infection) evaluated. Fish hematological profile, peripheral cell dynamics, plasma humoral immune parameters, leucocyte migration to the inflammatory focus and head-kidney gene expression were evaluated. Results show that methionine dietary supplementation improves seabass cellular immune status without evidence of activation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. Additionally, the observed enhanced immune status provided by methionine supplementation translated into an improved immune response to infection, as higher cellular differentiation/proliferation and recruitment to the inflammatory focus, improved plasma humoral immune parameters and modulation of key immune-related genes was observed. Lastly, after a bacterial challenge, higher survival was observed in fish fed supplemented diets, ultimately corroborating the positive effect of methionine administration for 4 weeks in the cellular immune status.",Real World Lab Data: Patterns of Lymphocyte Counts in Fingolimod Treated Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524432,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Fingolimod is approved for the treatment of highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and acts by its unique mechanism of action via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-modulation.

In this analysis, we aim to estimate the significance of the individual variation of distinct lymphocyte subsets for differences in absolute lymphocyte decrease in fingolimod treated patients and discuss how different lymphocyte subset patterns are related to clinical presentation in a long-term real life setting.",Commensal Bacteria-Specific CD4+ T Cell Responses in Health and Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524431,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Over the course of evolution, mammalian body surfaces have adapted their complex immune system to allow a harmless coexistence with the commensal microbiota. The adaptive immune response, in particular CD4+ T cell-mediated, is crucial to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis by discriminating between harmless (e.g., dietary compounds and intestinal microbes) and harmful stimuli (e.g., pathogens). To tolerate food molecules and microbial components, CD4+ T cells establish a finely tuned crosstalk with the environment whereas breakdown of these mechanisms might lead to chronic disease associated with mucosal barriers and beyond. How commensal-specific immune responses are regulated and how these molecular and cellular mechanisms can be manipulated to treat chronic disorders is yet poorly understood. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the regulation of commensal bacteria-specific CD4+ T cells. We place particular focus on the key role of commensal-specific CD4+ T cells in maintaining tolerance while efficiently eradicating local and systemic infections, with a focus on factors that trigger their aberrant activation.",Novel Treatments in Lupus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524430,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"The standard treatment options for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are focused on non-specific immunosuppression.

The outcome of diseases depends on the balance between the migration/accumulation of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages in damaged tissue. The mechanism of macrophage migration and subsequent accumulation is still not fully understood. Currently, the amoeboid adhesion-independent motility is considered essential for leukocyte migration in the three-dimensional environment. We challenge this hypothesis by studying the contribution of leukocyte adhesive receptors, integrins Î±MÎ²2, and Î±DÎ²2, to three-dimensional migration of M1-polarized, M2-polarized, and resident macrophages. Both integrins have a moderate expression on M2 macrophages, while Î±DÎ²2 is upregulated on M1 and Î±MÎ²2 demonstrates high expression on resident macrophages. The level of integrin expression determines its contribution to macrophage migration. Namely, intermediate expression supports macrophage migration, while a high integrin density inhibits it. Using in vitro three-dimensional migration and in vivo tracking of adoptively-transferred fluorescently-labeled macrophages during the resolution of inflammation, we found that strong adhesion of M1-activated macrophages translates to weak 3D migration, while moderate adhesion of M2-activated macrophages generates dynamic motility. Reduced migration of M1 macrophages depends on the high expression of Î±DÎ²2, since Î±D-deficiency decreased M1 macrophage adhesion and improved migration in fibrin matrix and peritoneal tissue. Similarly, the high expression of Î±MÎ²2 on resident macrophages prevents their amoeboid migration, which is markedly increased in Î±M-deficient macrophages. In contrast, Î±D- and Î±M-knockouts decrease the migration of M2 macrophages, demonstrating that moderate integrin expression supports cell motility. The results were confirmed in a diet-induced diabetes model. Î±D deficiency prevents the retention of inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue and improves metabolic parameters, while Î±M deficiency does not affect macrophage accumulation. Summarizing, Î²2 integrin-mediated adhesion may inhibit amoeboid and mesenchymal macrophage migration or support mesenchymal migration in tissue, and, therefore, represents an important target to control inflammation.",Presence of Immune Complexes of IgG/IgM Bound to B2-glycoprotein I Is Associated With Non-criteria Clinical Manifestations in Patients With Antiphospholipid Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524428,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Background: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune disorder defined by the presence of both clinical (thromboembolic events or pregnancy morbidity) and laboratory (antiphospholipid antibodies, aPL) manifestations. Despite their importance, several clinical manifestations strongly associated with APS such as livedo reticularis (LR), thrombocytopenia, sicca-ophthalmic(sicca), heart, or neurological manifestations are not included in the APS clinical classification criteria. Circulating immune complexes (CIC) formed by Beta-2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI) and aPL (B2-CIC) have been described and their presence has been related with thrombotic events. Methods: Cross-sectional and observational cohort study in APS patients with thrombotic symptomatology. Setting and Participants: Fifty-seven patients from the University Hospital Center Bezanijska Kosa (Belgrade, Serbia) who met the APS classification criteria (35 with primary APS and 22 with APS associated to systemic lupus erythematosus). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of B2-CIC in APS patients and to evaluate their association with clinical manifestations of APS not included in the classification criteria. Results: B2-CIC prevalence in APS patients was 19.3%. The presence of thrombocytopenia (OR:5.7), livedo reticularis (OR:5.6), sicca (OR:12.6), and leukopenia (OR:5.6) was significantly higher in patients with B2-CIC than in the rest of APS patients. C3 and C4 complement factor levels were significantly lower in B2-CIC positive patients, which suggests a greater consumption of complement. Patients with quadruple aPL positivity (triple aPL-positivity plus the presence of B2-CIC) showed a higher prevalence of thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and LR than those with single/double aPL-positivity. No significant differences were found in the frequencies observed in patients with triple-only vs. single/double aPL-positivity. There were no significant differences between patients with primary APS and lupus-associated APS regarding the prevalence of B2-CIC and outcomes. Conclusions: Presence of B2-CIC is strongly associated with several non-criteria clinical manifestations related to APS and to higher complement consumption. More studies are required to better understand the clinical significance of B2-CIC.",Suppression of Intestinal Epithelial Cell Chemokine Production by Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 and Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 Is Mediated by Secreted Bioactive Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524427,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Host intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) present at the gastrointestinal interface are exposed to pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria and their products. Certain probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been associated with a range of host-immune modulatory activities including down-regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production by IEC, with growing evidence suggesting that these bacteria secrete bioactive molecules with immunomodulatory activity. The aim of this study was to determine whether two lactobacilli with immunomodulatory activity [Lactobacillus rhamnosus R0011 (Lr) and Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 (Lh)], produce soluble mediators able to influence IEC responses to Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) ligands and pro-inflammatory cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor Î± (TNFÎ±), Interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²)], signals inducing IEC chemokine production during infection. To this end, the effects of cell-free supernatants (CFS) from Lr and Lh on IEC production of the pro-inflammatory chemokines interleukin (IL)-8 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1) induced by a range of host- or pathogen-derived pro-inflammatory stimuli were determined, and the impact on human HT-29 IEC and a primary IEC line (rat IEC-6) was compared. The Lr-CFS and Lh-CFS did not significantly modulate basal IL-8 production from HT-29 IECs or CINC-1 production from IEC-6 cells. However, both Lr-CFS and Lh-CFS significantly down-regulated IL-8 production from HT-29 IECs challenged with varied PRR ligands. Lr-CFS and Lh-CFS had differential effects on PRR-induced CINC-1 production by rat IEC-6 IECs, with no significant down-regulation of CINC-1 observed from IEC-6 IECs cultured with Lh-CFS. Further analysis of the Lr-CFS revealed down-regulation of IL-8 production induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and TNFÎ± Preliminary characterization of the bioactive constituent(s) of the Lr-CFS indicates that it is resistant to treatment with DNase, RNase, and an acidic protease, but is sensitive to alterations in pH. Taken together, these results indicate that these lactobacilli secrete bioactive molecules of low molecular weight that may modulate host innate immune activity through interactions with IEC.",Microphysiologic Human Tissue Constructs Reproduce Autologous Age-Specific BCG and HBV Primary Immunization in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524426,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Current vaccine development disregards human immune ontogeny, relying on animal models to select vaccine candidates targeting human infants, who are at greatest risk of infection worldwide, and receive the largest number of vaccines. To help accelerate and de-risk development of early-life effective immunization, we engineered a human age-specific microphysiologic vascular-interstitial interphase, suitable for pre-clinical modeling of distinct age-targeted immunity in vitro. Our Tissue Constructs (TCs) enable autonomous extravasation of monocytes that undergo rapid self-directed differentiation into migratory Dendritic Cells (DCs) in response to adjuvants and licensed vaccines such as Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) or Hepatitis B virus Vaccine (HBV). TCs contain a confluent human endothelium grown atop a tri-dimensional human extracellular matrix substrate, employ human age-specific monocytes and autologous non heat-treated plasma, and avoid the use of xenogenic materials and exogenous cytokines. Vaccine-pulsed TCs autonomously generated DCs that induced single-antigen recall responses from autologous naÃ¯ve and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, matching study participant immune-status, including BCG responses paralleling donor PPD status, BCG-induced adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity paralleling infant cohorts in vivo, and multi-dose HBV antigen-specific responses as demonstrated by lymphoproliferation and TCR sequencing. Overall, our microphysiologic culture method reproduced age- and antigen-specific recall responses to BCG and HBV immunization, closely resembling those observed after a birth immunization of human cohorts in vivo, offering for the first time a new approach to early pre-clinical selection of effective age-targeted vaccine candidates.",Dysregulated miRNAome and Proteome of PPRV Infected Goat PBMCs Reveal a Coordinated Immune Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524425,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"In this study, the miRNAome and proteome of virulent Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infected goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed. The identified differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were found to govern genes that modulate immune response based on the proteome data. The top 10 significantly enriched immune response processes were found to be governed by 98 genes. The top 10 DEmiRNAs governing these 98 genes were identified based on the number of genes governed by them. Out of these 10 DEmiRNAs, 7 were upregulated, and 3 were downregulated. These include miR-664, miR-2311, miR-2897, miR-484, miR-2440, miR-3533, miR-574, miR-210, miR-21-5p, and miR-30. miR-664 and miR-484 with proviral and antiviral activities, respectively, were upregulated in PPRV infected PBMCs. miR-210 that inhibits apoptosis was downregulated. miR-21-5p that decreases the sensitivity of cells to the antiviral activity of IFNs and miR-30b that inhibits antigen processing and presentation by primary macrophages were downregulated, indicative of a strong host response to PPRV infection. miR-21-5p was found to be inhibited on IPA upstream regulatory analysis of RNA-sequencing data. This miRNA that was also highly downregulated and was found to govern 16 immune response genes in the proteome data was selected for functional validation vis-a-vis TGFBR2 (TGF-beta receptor type-2). TGFBR2 that regulates cell differentiation and is involved in several immune response pathways was found to be governed by most of the identified immune modulating DEmiRNAs. The decreased luciferase activity in Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay indicated specific binding of miR-21-5p and miR-484 to their target thus establishing specific binding of the miRNAs to their targets.This is the first report on the miRNAome and proteome of virulent PPRV infected goat PBMCs.",CD137 (4-1BB) Signalosome: Complexity Is a Matter of TRAFs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524423,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"CD137 (4-1BB, Tnsfr9) is a member of the TNF-receptor (TNFR) superfamily without known intrinsic enzymatic activity in its cytoplasmic domain. Hence, akin to other members of the TNFR family, it relies on the TNFR-Associated-Factor (TRAF) family of adaptor proteins to build the CD137 signalosome for transducing signals into the cell. Thus, upon CD137 activation by binding of CD137L trimers or by crosslinking with agonist monoclonal antibodies, TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 are readily recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of CD137, likely as homo- and/or heterotrimers with different configurations, initiating the construction of the CD137 signalosome. The formation of TRAF2-RING dimers between TRAF2 molecules from contiguous trimers would help to establish a multimeric structure of TRAF-trimers that is probably essential for CD137 signaling. In addition, available studies have identified a large number of proteins that are recruited to CD137:TRAF complexes including ubiquitin ligases and proteases, kinases, and modulatory proteins. Working in a coordinated fashion, these CD137-signalosomes will ultimately promote CD137-mediated T cell proliferation and survival and will endow T cells with stronger effector functions. Current evidence allows to envision the molecular events that might take place in the early stages of CD137-signalosome formation, underscoring the key roles of TRAFs and of K63 and K48-ubiquitination of target proteins in the signaling process. Understanding the composition and fine regulation of CD137-signalosomes assembly and disassembly will be key to improve the therapeutic activities of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) encompassing the CD137 cytoplasmic domain and a new generation of CD137 agonists for the treatment of cancer."

The interaction between EspF and host proteins plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis. EspF protein binds to host SNX9 and N-WASP proteins to promote the colonization of pathogenic bacteria in intestinal epithelial cells; combines with cytokeratin 18, actin, 14-3-3Î¶, Arp2/3, profilin, and ZO-1 proteins to intervene in the redistribution of intermediate filaments, the rearrangement of actin, and the disruption of tight junctions; acts together with Abcf2 to boost host cell intrinsic apoptosis; and collaborates with Anxa6 protein to inhibit phagocytosis. The interaction between EspF and host proteins is key to the pathogenic mechanism of EHEC and EPEC. Here, we review how EspF protein functions through interactions with these 10 host proteins and contributes to the pathogenicity of EHEC/EPEC.",Persistent Occurrence of Cryptosporidium hominis and Giardia duodenalis Subtypes in a Welfare Institute.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524409,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Few data are available on the transmission dynamics of intestinal protozoa in children in welfare institutes. In this study, fecal specimens were collected from 396 children in a welfare institute in Shanghai, China during December 2011 (207 specimens), June 2012 (78 specimens), and September 2013 (111 specimens), and examined for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi by PCR analysis of the small subunit rRNA, triosephosphate isomerase, and internal transcribed spacer genes, respectively. The Cryptosporidium hominis and G. duodenalis assemblage A identified were further subtyped by multilocus sequence typing. Altogether, Cryptosporidium was detected in 39 (9.8%) children, with infection rates of 11.6% (24/207), 9.0% (7/78), and 7.2% (8/111) in December 2011, June 2012, and September 2013, respectively. Infection rates were higher in children of 0-12 months (20.4% compared to 0-7.3% in other age groups, P = 0.0001) and those with diarrhea (17.9% compared to 7.7% in those with no diarrhea, P = 0.006).

Co-infection of Cryptosporidium and G. duodenalis was seen in 19 (4.8%) children, but no E. bieneusi infection was detected in this study. All Cryptosporidium-positive specimens belonged to the subtype IaA14R4 of C. hominis, while all G. duodenalis-positive specimens belonged to sub-assemblage AII. Both were the same subtypes in a previous outbreak of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in a hospital ward hosting children from the welfare institute. Results of the study indicate that there was a persistent occurrence of limited C. hominis and G. duodenalis subtypes in the small enclosed community, with differences in age distribution and association with diarrhea occurrence between cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis.",Biosynthesis of Nanomaterials by Shewanella Species for Application in Lithium Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524408,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Nanomaterials exhibit extraordinary properties based on their size, shape, chemical composition, and crystal structure. Owing to their unique properties nanomaterials are preferred over their bulk counterparts for a number of applications. Although conventional physical and chemical routes were established for the massive production of nanomaterials, there are some drawbacks such as environmental burden and high cost that cannot be disregarded. Recently, there has been great interest toward the green synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials. It has been reported that dissimilatory metal reduction by microorganisms is a cost-effective process to remediate toxic organic and inorganic compounds under anaerobic conditions. Particularly, members of the Shewanella genus have been utilized to produce various biogenic nanomaterials with unique micro/nanostructured morphologies through redox transformations as well as to remove harmful metals and metalloids in eco-efficient and environment-friendly methods under ambient conditions. In the present mini-review, we specifically address the active utilization of microbial respiration processes for the synthesis of novel functional biogenic nanomaterials by the members of the Shewanella genus. This biosynthetic method may provide alternative approaches to produce electrode materials for sustainable energy storage applications.",Assessing Response to Therapy for Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Lung Disease: Quo Vadis?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524407,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Assessing progression of disease or response to treatment remains a major challenge in the clinical management of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections of the lungs. Serial assessments of validated measures of treatment response address whether the current therapeutic approach is on track toward clinical cure, which remains a fundamental question for clinicians and patients during the course of NTM disease treatment. The 2015 NTM Research Consortium Workshop, which included a patient advisory panel, identified treatment response biomarkers as a priority area for investigation. Limited progress in addressing this challenge also hampers drug development efforts. The Biomarker Qualification Program at the FDA supports the use of a validated treatment response biomarker across multiple drug development programs. Current approaches in clinical practice include microbiologic and radiographic monitoring, along with symptomatic and quality-of-life assessments. Blood-based monitoring, including assessments of humoral and cell-mediated NTM-driven immune responses, remain under investigation. Alignment of data collection schemes in prospective multicenter studies, including the support of biosample repositories, will support identification of treatment response biomarkers under standard-of-care and investigational therapeutic strategies. In this review, we outline the role of treatment monitoring biomarkers in both clinical practice and drug development frameworks.",A Short-Term Response of Soil Microbial Communities to Cadmium and Organic Substrate Amendment in Long-Term Contaminated Soil by Toxic Elements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524406,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Two long-term contaminated soils differing in contents of Pb, Zn, As, Cd were compared in a microcosm experiment for changes in microbial community structure and respiration after various treatments. We observed that the extent of long-term contamination (over 200 years) by toxic elements did not change the total numbers and diversity of bacteria but influenced their community composition. Namely, numbers of Actinobacteria determined by phylum specific qPCR increased and also the proportion of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi increased in Illumina sequence libraries in the more contaminated soil. In the experiment, secondary disturbance by supplemented cadmium (doses from double to 100-fold the concentration in the original soil) and organic substrates (cellobiose or straw) increased bacterial diversity in the less contaminated soil and decreased it in the more contaminated soil. Respiration in the experiment was higher in the more contaminated soil in all treatments and correlated with bacterial numbers. Considering the most significant changes in bacterial community, it seemed that particularly Actinobacteria withstand contamination by toxic elements. The results proved higher resistance to secondary disturbance in terms of both, respiration and bacterial community structure in the less contaminated soil.",Improved Microbial Safety of Direct Ozone-Depurated Shellstock Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) by Superchilled Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524405,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"The effect of superchilled storage at -1Â°C on the microbial safety of oyster depurated with 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/L ozone was studied for 14 days. Fecal coliforms (4,100-16,000 MPN/100 g), Escherichia coli (1,500-3,650 MPN/100 g), Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 (13.0-102.0 MPN/g), and Salmonella spp. (2.270-3.035 Ã 103 CFU/g) were initially present in raw oysters. After 6 h depuration, fecal coliform counts decreased (P < 0.05) to 300, 20 and 20 MPN/100 g for 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/L treatments, while a 0.3 log decrease in control oysters was observed. Initial E. coli counts decreased (P < 0.05) in oysters to 50, 20, and 20 MPN/100 g for 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/L treatments, respectively. A 1 log reduction in V. cholerae non-O1/non-139 levels were observed in 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L-treatments after 2 and 4 h depuration. Salmonella spp. was not detected in oyster samples after 6 h depuration in 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L-ozone treatments. Considering the bacterial loads after depuration, at the end of superchilled storage the 0.4 mg/L-ozonated oysters attained lower (P < 0.05) fecal coliform levels (280 MPN/100 g) and E. coli counts in 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L-ozonated oysters (20 and 95 MPN/100 g, respectively). A 2-log decrease in V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 levels on day 5 in 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L-ozonated oysters (< 0.3 MPN/g) was attained. V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 counts in control oysters decreased 1 log on day 9 of superchilled storage. Salmonella spp. was not detected in ozonated and superchilled stored oysters. Levels of fecal coliforms, E. coli, Salmonella spp., and V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 in non-ozone depurated oyster samples were higher than in control, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L ozonated oyster samples during superchilled storage. The cumulative mortality rates after 14 days of storage for superchilled oysters (22.2%) was higher (P < 0.05) than 0.6 mg/L O3 (7.2%) and 0.4 mg/L O3 (5.8%) treatments, and control oysters (5.6%). pH values in control oysters decreased significantly (P < 0.05) throughout the storage period but not in oysters of both ozone treatments, indicating no detrimental effects on oyster survival. The results of this study suggest that superchilled storage enables ozonated shellstock oysters (0.4 mg/L-6 h) stored for 9 days to be safe human consumption.",A Rhodococcal Transcriptional Regulatory Mechanism Detects the Common Lactone Ring of AHL Quorum-Sensing Signals and Triggers the Quorum-Quenching Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524404,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"The biocontrol agent Rhodococcus erythropolis disrupts virulence of plant and human Gram-negative pathogens by catabolizing their N-acyl-homoserine lactones. This quorum-quenching activity requires the expression of the qsd (quorum-sensing signal degradation) operon, which encodes the lactonase QsdA and the fatty acyl-CoA ligase QsdC, involved in the catabolism of lactone ring and acyl chain moieties of signaling molecules, respectively. Here, we demonstrate the regulation of qsd operon expression by a TetR-like family repressor, QsdR. This repression was lifted by adding the pathogen quorum signal or by deleting the qsdR gene, resulting in enhanced lactone degrading activity. Using interactomic approaches and transcriptional fusion strategy, the qsd operon derepression was elucidated: it is operated by the binding of the common part of signaling molecules, the homoserine lactone ring, to the effector-receiving domain of QsdR, preventing a physical binding of QsdR to the qsd promoter region. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence revealing quorum signals as inducers of the suitable quorum-quenching pathway, confirming this TetR-like protein as a lactone sensor. This regulatory mechanism designates the qsd operon as encoding a global disrupting pathway for degrading a wide range of signal substrates, allowing a broad spectrum anti-virulence activity mediated by the rhodococcal biocontrol agent. Understanding the regulation mechanisms of qsd operon expression led also to the development of biosensors useful to monitor in situ the presence of exogenous signals and quorum-quenching activity.","The XRE-DUF397 Protein Pair, Scr1 and Scr2, Acts as a Strong Positive Regulator of Antibiotic Production in Streptomyces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524403,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"The xenobiotic response element (XRE) transcription factors belong to a regulator family frequently found in Streptomyces that are often followed by small proteins with a DUF397 domain. In fact, the pair XRE-DUF397 has been proposed to comprise toxin-antitoxin (TA) type II systems. In this work, we demonstrate that one of these putative TA-systems, encoded by the genes SCO4441 and SCO4442 of Streptomyces coelicolor, and denominated Scr1/Scr2 (which stands for S. coelicolorregulator), does not behave as a toxin-antitoxin system under the conditions used as was originally expected. Instead the pair Scr1/Scr2 acts as a strong positive regulator of endogenous antibiotic production in S. coelicolor. The analysis of the 19 Streptomyces strains tested determined that overexpression of the pair Scr1/Scr2 drastically induces the production of antibiotics not only in S. coelicolor, but also in Streptomyces lividans, Streptomyces peucetius, Streptomyces steffisburgensis and Streptomyces sp. CA-240608. Our work also shows that Scr1 needs Scr2 to exert positive regulation on antibiotic production.","Flux Connections Between Gluconate Pathway, Glycolysis, and Pentose-Phosphate Pathway During Carbohydrate Metabolism in Bacillus megaterium QM B1551.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524402,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Bacillus megaterium is a bacterium of great importance as a plant-beneficial bacterium in agricultural applications and in industrial bioproduction of proteins. Understanding intracellular processing of carbohydrates in this species is crucial to predicting natural carbon utilization as well as informing strategies in metabolic engineering. Here, we applied stable isotope-assisted metabolomics profiling and metabolic flux analysis to elucidate, at high resolution, the connections of the different catabolic routes for carbohydrate metabolism immediately following substrate uptake in B. megaterium QM B1551. We performed multiple 13C tracer experiments to obtain both kinetic and long-term 13C profiling of intracellular metabolites. In addition to the direct phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) prior to oxidation to 6-phosphogluconate (6P-gluconate), the labeling data also captured glucose catabolism through the gluconate pathway involving glucose oxidation to gluconate followed by phosphorylation to 6P-gluconate. Our data further confirmed the absence of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in B. megaterium and showed that subsequent catabolism of 6P-gluconate was instead through the oxidative pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway. Quantitative flux analysis of glucose-grown cells showed equal partition of consumed glucose from G6P to the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway and from G6P to the PP pathway through 6P-gluconate. Growth on fructose alone or xylose alone was consistent with the ability of B. megaterium to use each substrate as a sole source of carbon. However, a detailed 13C mapping during simultaneous feeding of B. megaterium on glucose, fructose, and xylose indicated non-uniform intracellular investment of the different carbohydrate substrates. Flux of glucose-derived carbons dominated the gluconate pathway and the PP pathway, whereas carbon flux from both glucose and fructose populated the EMP pathway; there was no assimilatory flux of xylose-derived carbons. Collectively, our findings provide new quantitative insights on the contribution of the different catabolic routes involved in initiating carbohydrate catabolism in B. megaterium and related Bacillus species.","Influence of CO2 Degassing on the Microbial Community in a Dry Mofette Field in HartouÅ¡ov, Czech Republic (Western Eger Rift).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524401,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"The Cheb Basin (CZ) is a shallow Neogene intracontinental basin filled with fluvial and lacustrine sediments that is located in the western part of the Eger Rift. The basin is situated in a seismically active area and is characterized by diffuse degassing of mantle-derived CO2 in mofette fields. The HartouÅ¡ov mofette field shows a daily CO2 flux of 23-97 tons of CO2 released over an area of 0.35 km2 and a soil gas concentration of up to 100% CO2. The present study aims to explore the geo-bio interactions provoked by the influence of elevated CO2 concentrations on the geochemistry and microbial community of soils and sediments. To sample the strata, two 3-m cores were recovered. One core stems from the center of the degassing structure, whereas the other core was taken 8 m from the ENE and served as an undisturbed reference site. The sites were compared regarding their geochemical features, microbial abundances, and microbial community structures. The mofette site is characterized by a low pH and high TOC/sulfate contents. Striking differences in the microbial community highlight the substantial impact of elevated CO2 concentrations and their associated side effects on microbial processes. The abundance of microbes did not show a typical decrease with depth, indicating that the uprising CO2-rich fluid provides sufficient substrate for chemolithoautotrophic anaerobic microorganisms. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes and multivariate statistics reveals that the pH strongly influences microbial composition and explains around 38.7% of the variance at the mofette site and 22.4% of the variance between the mofette site and the undisturbed reference site. Accordingly, acidophilic microorganisms (e.g., OTUs assigned to Acidobacteriaceae and Acidithiobacillus) displayed a much higher relative abundance at the mofette site than at the reference site. The microbial community at the mofette site is characterized by a high relative abundance of methanogens and taxa involved in sulfur cycling. The present study provides intriguing insights into microbial life and geo-bio interactions in an active seismic region dominated by emanating mantle-derived CO2-rich fluids, and thereby builds the basis for further studies, e.g., focusing on the functional repertoire of the communities. However, it remains open if the observed patterns can be generalized for different time-points or sites."

Most of these complex polymers have a marked polyanionic character. For instance, the red algal cell wall is mainly composed of sulfated galactans, agars and carrageenans, while brown algae contain alginate and fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides (FCSP) as cell wall polysaccharides. Some marine heterotrophic bacteria have developed abilities to grow on such macroalgal polysaccharides. This is the case of Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora 9T (ATCC 43555T), a marine gammaproteobacterium isolated in 1955 and which was an early model organism for studying carrageenan catabolism. We present here the genomic analysis of P. carrageenovora. Its genome is composed of two chromosomes and of a large plasmid encompassing 109 protein-coding genes. P. carrageenovora possesses a diverse repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), notably specific for the degradation of macroalgal polysaccharides (laminarin, alginate, FCSP, carrageenans). We confirm these predicted capacities by screening the growth of P. carrageenovora with a large collection of carbohydrates. Most of these CAZyme genes constitute clusters located either in the large chromosome or in the small one. Unexpectedly, all the carrageenan catabolism-related genes are found in the plasmid, suggesting that P. carrageenovora acquired its hallmark capacity for carrageenan degradation by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Whereas P. carrageenovora is able to use lambda-carrageenan as a sole carbon source, genomic and physiological analyses demonstrate that its catabolic pathway for kappa- and iota-carrageenan is incomplete. This is due to the absence of the recently discovered 3,6-anhydro-D-galactosidase genes (GH127 and GH129 families). A genomic comparison with 52 Pseudoalteromonas strains confirms that carrageenan catabolism has been recently acquired only in a few species. Even though the loci for cellulose biosynthesis and alginate utilization are located on the chromosomes, they were also horizontally acquired. However, these HGTs occurred earlier in the evolution of the Pseudoalteromonas genus, the cellulose- and alginate-related loci being essentially present in one large, late-diverging clade (LDC). Altogether, the capacities to degrade cell wall polysaccharides from macroalgae are not ancestral in the Pseudoalteromonas genus. Such catabolism in P. carrageenovora resulted from a succession of HGTs, likely allowing an adaptation to the life on the macroalgal surface.",Proteasomal Degradation Machinery: Favorite Target of HIV-1 Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524389,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Proteasomal degradation pathways play a central role in regulating a variety of protein functions by controlling not only their turnover but also the physiological behavior of the cell. This makes it an attractive target for the pathogens, especially viruses which rely on the host cellular machinery for their propagation and pathogenesis. Viruses have evolutionarily developed various strategies to manipulate the host proteasomal machinery thereby creating a cellular environment favorable for their own survival and replication. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is one of the most dreadful viruses which has rapidly spread throughout the world and caused high mortality due to its high evolution rate. Here, we review the various mechanisms adopted by HIV-1 to exploit the cellular proteasomal machinery in order to escape the host restriction factors and components of host immune system for supporting its own multiplication, and successfully created an infection.",Comparison of Serological and Molecular Methods With High-Throughput Sequencing for the Detection and Quantification of Grapevine Fanleaf Virus in Vineyard Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524388,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) is the main causal agent of fanleaf degeneration, the most damaging viral disease of grapevine. GFLV is included in most grapevine certification programs that rely on robust diagnostic tools such as biological indexing, serological methods, and molecular techniques, for the identification of clean stocks. The emergence of high throughput sequencing (HTS) offers new opportunities for detecting GFLV and other viruses in grapevine accessions of interest. Here, two HTS-based methods, i.e., RNAseq and smallRNAseq (focusing on the 21 to 27 nt) were explored for their potential to characterize the virome of grapevine samples from two 30-year-old GFLV-infected vineyards in the Champagne region of France. smallrnaseq was optimal for the detection of a wide range of viral species within a sample and RNAseq was the method of choice for full-length viral genome assembly. The implementation of a protocol to discriminate between low GFLV titer and in silico contamination (intra-lane contamination due to index misassignment) during data processing was critical for data analyses. Furthermore, we compared the performance of semi-quantitative DAS-ELISA (double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), RT-qPCR (Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction), Immuno capture (IC)-RT-PCR, northern blot for viral small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) detection and RNAseq for the detection and quantification of GFLV. While detection limits were variable among methods, as expected, GFLV diagnosis was consistently achieved with all of these diagnostic methods. Together, this work highlights the robustness of DAS-ELISA, the current method routinely used in the French grapevine certification program, for the detection of GFLV and offers perspectives on the potential of HTS as an approach of high interest for certification.",Recovery of the Peptidoglycan Turnover Product Released by the Autolysin Atl in Staphylococcus aureus Involves the Phosphotransferase System Transporter MurP and the Novel 6-phospho-N-acetylmuramidase MupG.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524387,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"The peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall undergoes a permanent turnover during cell growth and differentiation. In the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, the major peptidoglycan hydrolase Atl is required for accurate cell division, daughter cell separation and autolysis. Atl is a bifunctional N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase/endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase that releases peptides and the disaccharide N-acetylmuramic acid-Î²-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine (MurNAc-GlcNAc) from the peptido-glycan. Here we revealed the recycling pathway of the cell wall turnover product MurNAc-GlcNAc in S. aureus. The latter disaccharide is internalized and concomitantly phosphorylated by the phosphotransferase system (PTS) transporter MurP, which had been implicated previously in the uptake and phosphorylation of MurNAc. Since MurP mutant cells accumulate MurNAc-GlcNAc and not MurNAc in the culture medium during growth, the disaccharide represents the physiological substrate of the PTS transporter. We further identified and characterized a novel 6-phospho-N-acetylmuramidase, named MupG, which intracellularly hydrolyses MurNAc 6-phosphate-GlcNAc, the product of MurP-uptake and phosphorylation, yielding MurNAc 6-phosphate and GlcNAc. MupG is the first characterized representative of a novel family of glycosidases containing domain of unknown function 871 (DUF871). The corresponding gene mupG (SAUSA300_0192) of S. aureus strain USA300 is the first gene within a putative operon that also includes genes encoding the MurNAc 6-phosphate etherase MurQ, MurP, and the putative transcriptional regulator MurR. Using mass spectrometry, we observed cytoplasmic accumulation of MurNAc 6-phosphate-GlcNAc in ÎmupG and ÎmupGmurQ markerless non-polar deletion mutants, but not in the wild type or in the complemented ÎmupG strain. MurNAc 6-phosphate-GlcNAc levels in the mutants increased during stationary phase, in accordance with previous observations regarding peptidoglycan recycling in S. aureus.","Genetic Differentiation, Diversity, and Drug Susceptibility of Candida krusei.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524386,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Candida krusei is a notable pathogenic fungus that causes invasive candidiasis, mainly due to its natural resistance to fluconazole. However, to date, there is limited research on the genetic population features of C. krusei. We developed a set of microsatellite markers for this organism, with a cumulative discriminatory power of 1,000. Using these microsatellite loci, 48 independent C. krusei strains of clearly known the sources, were analyzed. Furthermore, susceptibility to 9 antifungal agents was determined for each strain, by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Population structure analyses revealed that C. krusei could be separated into two clusters. The cluster with the higher genetic diversity had wider MIC ranges for six antifungal agents. Furthermore, the highest MIC values of the six antifungal agents belonged to the cluster with higher genetic diversity. The higher genetic diversity cluster might have a better adaptive capacity when C. krusei is under selection pressure from antifungal agents, and thus is more likely to develop drug resistance.",Putative Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria Associated With the Rhizosphere and Root Endosphere of Wheat Plants Grown in an Andisol From Southern Chile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524385,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Acidic ash derived volcanic soils (Andisols) support 50% of cereal production in Chile. Nitrogen (N) is essential for cereal crops and commonly added as urea with consequent environmental concerns due to leaching. Despite the relevance of N to plant growth, few studies have focused on understanding the application, management and ecological role of N2-fixing bacterial populations as tool for improve the N nutrition of cereal crops in Chile. It is known that N2-fixing bacteria commonly inhabits diverse plant compartments (e.g., rhizosphere and root endosphere) where they can supply N for plant growth. Here, we used culture-independent and dependent approaches to characterize and compare the putative N2-fixing bacteria associated with the rhizosphere and root endosphere of wheat plants grown in an Andisol from southern Chile. Our results showed significantly greater bacterial loads in the rhizosphere than the root endosphere. Quantitative PCR results indicated that the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene ranged from 1012~1013 and 107~108 g-1 sample in rhizosphere and root endosphere, respectively. The nifH gene copy number ranged from 105~106 and 105 g-1 sample in rhizosphere and root endosphere, respectively. The total culturable bacteria number ranged from 109~1010 and 107~108 CFU g-1 sample in rhizosphere and 104~105 and 104 CFU g-1 sample in root endosphere using LB and NM-1 media, respectively. Indirect counts of putative N2-fixing bacteria were 103 and 102~103 CFU g-1 sample in rhizosphere and root endosphere using NFb medium, respectively. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from randomly selected putative N2-fixing bacteria revealed the presence of members of Proteobacteria (Bosea and Roseomonas), Actinobacteria (Georgenia, Mycobacterium, Microbacterium, Leifsonia, and Arthrobacter), Bacteroidetes (Chitinophaga) and Firmicutes (Bacillus and Psychrobacillus) taxa. Differences in 16S rRNA and putative nifH-containing bacterial communities between rhizosphere and root endosphere were shown by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). This study shows a compartmentalization between rhizosphere and root endosphere for both the abundance and diversity of total (16S rRNA) and putative N2-fixing bacterial communities on wheat plants grown in Chilean Andisols. This information can be relevant for the design and application of agronomic strategies to enhance sustainable N-utilization in cereal crops in Chile.",A Metabolomics Approach Reveals Immunomodulatory Effects of Proteinaceous Molecules Derived From Gut Bacteria Over Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524384,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"There are strong evidences that probiotics influence the immune status of the host, in a strain-specific manner, acting in the gastrointestinal tract. On the hypothesis that certain extracellular proteins and peptides from gut bacteria may mediate part of this immunomodulation and assuming they are able to diffuse through the mucus layer and interact with immune cells we have developed this work. Our study attempts to understand the immunomodulatory mechanisms of (i) Pext, the extracellular protein fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM20079T, (ii) HM14, a peptide encrypted in an extracellular glycoside hydrolase from Bifidobacterium longum NCIMB 8809 and (iii) Escherichia coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-known pro-inflammatory molecule, over human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). An untargeted LC-ESI-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach was applied to reveal intracellular changes in treated-PBMCs isolated from healthy donors. Differences in NADH arrest, NAD+ concentration reduction, as well as increases in palmitic acid and methanephrin were observed in HM14 and Pext treated-cells compared to those stimulated with LPS. This would support an anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism of action of such proteinaceous molecules. Moreover, this methodology has confirms the importance of metabolomics approaches to better understanding immune cell responses to gut bacterial-derived molecules.",Germination and Growth Analysis of Streptomyces lividans at the Single-Cell Level Under Varying Medium Compositions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524383,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Quantitative single-cell cultivation has provided fundamental contributions to our understanding of heterogeneity among industrially used microorganisms. Filamentous growing Streptomyces species are emerging platform organisms for industrial production processes, but their exploitation is still limited due to often reported high batch-to-batch variations and unexpected growth and production differences. Population heterogeneity is suspected to be one responsible factor, which is so far not systematically investigated at the single-cell level. Novel microfluidic single-cell cultivation devices offer promising solutions to investigate these phenomena. In this study, we investigated the germination and growth behavior of Streptomyces lividans TK24 under varying medium compositions on different complexity levels (i.e., mycelial growth, hyphal growth and tip elongation) on single-cell level. Our analysis reveals a remarkable stability within growth and germination of spores and early mycelium development when exposed to constant and defined environments. We show that spores undergo long metabolic adaptation processes of up to > 30 h to adjust to new medium conditions, rather than using a ""persister"" strategy as a possibility to cope with rapidly changing environments. Due to this uniform behavior, we conclude that S. lividans can be cultivated quite robustly under constant environmental conditions as provided by microfluidic cultivation approaches. Failure and non-reproducible cultivations are thus most likely to be found in less controllable larger-scale cultivation workflows and as a result of environmental gradients within large-scale cultivations.",A Population-Based Descriptive Atlas of Invasive Pneumococcal Strains Recovered Within the U.S. During 2015-2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524382,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has greatly decreased since implementation in the U.S. of the 7 valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2000 and 13 valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 2010. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to predict phenotypic traits (serotypes, antimicrobial phenotypes, and pilus determinants) and determine multilocus genotypes from 5334 isolates (~90% of cases) recovered during 2015-2016 through Active Bacterial Core surveillance. We identified 44 serotypes; 26 accounted for 98% of the isolates. PCV13 serotypes (inclusive of serotype 6C) accounted for 1503 (28.2%) isolates, with serotype 3 most common (657/5334, 12.3%), while serotypes 1 and 5 were undetected. Of 305 isolates from children <5 yrs, 60 (19.7%) were of PCV13 serotypes 19A, 19F, 3, 6B, and 23F (58/60 were 19A, 19F, or 3). We quantitated MLST-based lineages first detected during the post-PCV era (since 2002) that potentially arose through serotype-switching. The 7 predominant emergent post-PCV strain complexes included 23B/CC338, 15BC/CC3280, 19A/CC244, 4/CC439, 15A/CC156, 35B/CC156, and 15BC/CC156. These strains accounted for 332 isolates (6.2% of total) and were more frequently observed in children <5 yrs (17.7%; 54/305). Fifty-seven categories of recently emerged (in the post PCV7 period) putative serotype-switch variants were identified, accounting for 402 isolates. Many of these putative switch variants represented newly emerged resistant strains. Penicillin-nonsusceptibility (MICs > 0.12 Î¼g/ml) was found among 22.4% (1193/5334) isolates, with higher penicillin MICs (2-8 Î¼g/ml) found in 8.0% (425/5334) of isolates that were primarily (372/425, 87.5%) serotypes 35B and 19A. Most (792/1193, 66.4%) penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates were macrolide-resistant, 410 (34.4%) of which were erm gene positive and clindamycin-resistant. The proportion of macrolide-resistant isolates increased with increasing penicillin MICs; even isolates with reduced penicillin susceptibility (MIC = 0.06 Î¼g/ml) were much more likely to be macrolide-resistant than basally penicillin-susceptible isolates (MIC < 0.03 Î¼g/ml). The contribution of recombination to strain diversification was assessed through quantitating 35B/CC558-specific bioinformatic pipeline features among non-CC558 CCs and determining the sizes of gene replacements. Although IPD has decreased greatly and stabilized in the post-PCV13 era, the species continually generates recombinants that adapt to selective pressures exerted by vaccines and antimicrobials. These data serve as a baseline for monitoring future changes within each invasive serotype.",A New Role of OmpR in Acid and Osmotic Stress in Salmonella and E. coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524381,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 17,"Bacteria survive and respond to diverse environmental conditions and during infection inside the host by systematic regulation of stress response genes. E. coli and S. Typhimurium can undergo large changes in intracellular osmolality (up to 1.8 Osmol/kg) and can tolerate cytoplasmic acidification to at least pHi 5.6. Recent analyses of single cells challenged a long held view that bacteria respond to extracellular acid stress by rapid acidification followed by a rapid recovery. It is now appreciated that both S. Typhimurium and E. coli maintain an acidic cytoplasm through the actions of the outer membrane protein regulator OmpR via its regulation of distinct signaling pathways. However, a comprehensive comparison of OmpR regulons between S. Typhimurium and E. coli is lacking. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of wild-type and ompR null strains of the intracellular pathogen S. Typhimurium and a commensal E. coli in response to acid and osmotic stress. Herein, we classify distinct OmpR regulons and also identify shared OmpR regulatory pathways between S. Typhimurium and E. coli in response to acid and osmotic stress. Our study establishes OmpR as a key regulator of bacterial virulence, growth and metabolism, in addition to its role in regulating outer membrane proteins."

This implies that maternal metabolism may program the developing fetal brain. We now asked whether a family history of type 2 diabetes without metabolic programing also impacts fetal brain activity. We therefore investigated brain activity in fetuses of normal glucose tolerant mothers with and without family history of type 2 diabetes (FHD+ and FHD-). Methods: A 75 g oGTT was performed in healthy pregnant women. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured after 0, 60, and 120 min. Each blood draw was preceded by fetal magnetoencephalographic (fMEG) recordings of fAER. From a group of 167 participants, a subsample of 52 metabolically healthy women, 37 with a negative, and 15 with a positive FHD (at least one first- or second-degree relative) was carefully selected based on the following inclusion criteria: inconspicuous pregnancy, no GDM, BMI 18.5-30 kg/m2, no preterm birth and at least two fMEG with detectable fetal responses during oGTT. Results: An ANOVA showed a significant interaction between fMEG measurement time during the oGTT and FHD on fAER latency [F(2) = 4.163, p = 0.018]. Fetuses of mothers with FHD+ had a prolonged fAER (273 Â± 113 ms) compared to fetuses of mothers with FHD- (219 Â± 69 ms) at 60 min during the oGTT [F(1) = 4.902, p = 0.032]. There were no significant differences in age, BMI before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy and gestational age between the groups. Maternal glucose levels and insulin sensitivity were also not significantly different. Discussion: In addition to the previously shown influence of maternal metabolism on fetal brain activity, maternal family history of diabetes (FHD) is also linked to fetal postprandial brain activity. This indicates that genetic and/or epigenetic factors modulate the postprandial brain response of the developing fetus.",Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Induced Downstream Responses to Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and 3-Iodothyronamine (3-T1AM) in Human Corneal Keratocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524369,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 17,"This study was undertaken to determine if crosstalk among the transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 8 (TRPM8), TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor triad modulates VEGF-induced Ca2+ signaling in human corneal keratocytes. Using RT-PCR, qPCR and immunohistochemistry, we determined TRPV1 and TRPM8 gene and protein coexpression in a human corneal keratocyte cell line (HCK) and human corneal cross sections. Fluorescence Ca2+ imaging using both a photomultiplier and a single cell digital imaging system as well as planar patch-clamping measured relative intracellular Ca2+ levels and underlying whole-cell currents. The TRPV1 agonist capsaicin increased both intracellular Ca2+ levels and whole-cell currents, while the antagonist capsazepine (CPZ) inhibited them. VEGF-induced Ca2+ transients and rises in whole-cell currents were suppressed by CPZ, whereas a selective TRPM8 antagonist, AMTB, increased VEGF signaling. In contrast, an endogenous thyroid hormone-derived metabolite 3-Iodothyronamine (3-T1AM) suppressed increases in the VEGF-induced current. The TRPM8 agonist menthol increased the currents, while AMTB suppressed this response. The VEGF-induced increases in Ca2+ influx and their underlying ionic currents stem from crosstalk between VEGFR and TRPV1, which can be impeded by 3-T1AM-induced TRPM8 activation. Such suppression in turn blocks VEGF-induced TRPV1 activation. Therefore, crosstalk between TRPM8 and TRPV1 inhibits VEGFR-induced activation of TRPV1.",Metabolic and Cognitive Outcomes of Subchronic Once-Daily Intranasal Insulin Administration in Healthy Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524368,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 17,"Insulin acts in the brain to limit food intake and improve memory function. We have previously shown that 8 weeks of intranasal insulin delivered in four daily doses of 40 IU decrease body weight and enhance word list recall. In the present study, we investigated the effect on body composition, endocrine parameters, and memory performance of 8 weeks of once-daily administration of 160 IU in healthy men. We assumed that intranasal insulin administered before nocturnal sleep, a period of relative metabolic inactivity that moreover benefits memory formation, would be superior to insulin delivery in the morning and placebo administration. After a 2-week baseline period, healthy male normal-weight subjects (mean age, 27.1 Â± 0.9 years) received either placebo, 160 IU intranasal insulin in the morning, or 160 IU in the evening (n = 12 per group) for 8 consecutive weeks. Throughout the experiment, we measured body weight and body composition as well as circulating concentrations of glucose, insulin, adrenocorticotropin, cortisol, growth hormone, insulin-like growth-factor 1, adiponectin, and leptin. Declarative and procedural memory function was repeatedly assessed by means of, respectively, word list recall and word-stem priming. We found that neither morning nor evening insulin compared to placebo administration induced discernible changes in body weight and body composition. Delayed recall of words showed slight improvements by insulin administration in the evening, and serum cortisol concentrations were reduced after 2 weeks of insulin administration in the morning compared to the other groups. Results indicate that catabolic long-term effects of central nervous insulin delivery necessitate repetitive, presumably pre-meal delivery schedules. The observed memory improvements, although generally weaker than previously found effects, suggest that sleep after intranasal insulin administration may support its beneficial cognitive impact.",Increased Level of Angiopoietin Like Proteins 4 and 8 in People With Sleep Apnea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524367,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 17,"Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder caused by the complete or partial obstruction of the upper airways. The worldwide prevalence of OSA is increasing due to its close association with obesity epidemic and multiple health complications, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL)-4 and ANGPTL8 (betatrophin) have been suggested to play a role in the development of these diseases through their role in regulating the metabolism of plasma lipid molecules. This study was designed to evaluate ANGPTL4 and 8 levels in an OSA group and a control group to clarify the effect of OSA on ANGPTL4 and 8 levels. Methods: In total, 74 subjects were enrolled in this study, including 22 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls with the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) score of <5 events/h and 52 subjects with an AHI score of >5 events/h. Sleep apnea was assessed using a portable sleep test. ANGPTL4 and 8 levels were measured in plasma samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Mean AHI score (2.5 Â± 1.6) in the control group was significantly lower than that in the OSA group (22.9 Â± 17.9; p < 0.0001). Leptin, interleukin-(IL) 6, insulin, and HOMA-IR values were higher in the OSA group than in the control group. ANGPTL8 level was higher in the OSA group (1130.0 Â± 108.61 pg/mL) than in the control group (809.39 Â± 108.78 pg/mL; p = 0.041). Similarly, ANGPTL4 was higher in the OSA group (179.26 Â± 12.89 ng/mL) than in the control group (142.63 Â±7.99 ng/mL; p = 0.018). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that ANGPTL4 and 8 levels were increased in subjects with OSA, suggesting that the upregulation of these lipid metabolism regulators might play a role in lipid dysregulation observed in people with OSA.",Clinical and Radiological Markers of Extra-Motor Deficits in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524366,Frontiers in neurology,2018 12 17,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is now universally recognized as a complex multisystem disorder with considerable extra-motor involvement.

Nighttime sleep has a positive influence on motor learning in healthy individuals, whereas the effect of daytime sleep on neuro-rehabilitative training and relearning of the trained skills is often neglected. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between daytime sleep (napping) and the ability to learn a new visuomotor task in chronic stroke patients. The main hypothesis was that sleep enhances motor memory consolidation after training resulting in better motor performance after a period of daytime sleep. Thirty stroke survivors completed the study. They were randomized to one of three different conditions (i) wakeful resting, (ii) short nap (10-20 min), or (iii) long nap (50-80 min). All individuals trained the task with the contralesional, stroke-impaired hand, behavioral evaluation was performed after the break time (wake, nap), and 24 h later. Patients demonstrated a significant task-related behavioral improvement throughout the training. In contrast to the main hypothesis, there was no evidence for sleep-dependent motor consolidation early after the initial, diurnal break, or after an additional full night of sleep. In a secondary analysis, the performance changes of stroke survivors were compared with those of a group of healthy older adults who performed the identical task within the same experimental setup with their non-dominant hand. Performance levels were comparable between both cohorts at all time points. Stroke-related difficulties in motor control did not impact on the degree of performance improvement through training and daytime sleep did not impact on the behavioral gains in the two groups. In summary, the current study indicates that one-time daytime sleep after motor training does not influence behavioral gains.",Early Recurrent Ischemic Lesions in Patients With Cryptogenic Stroke and Patent Foramen Ovale: An Observational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524364,Frontiers in neurology,2018 12 17,"Background: Randomized controlled trials indicate that patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure reduces risk of stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. However, the optimal time point for PFO closure is unknown and depends on the risk of stroke recurrence. Objective: We aimed to investigate risk of early new ischemic lesions on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. Methods: Cryptogenic stroke patients underwent serial MRI examinations within 1 week after symptom onset to detect early new ischemic lesions. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions were delineated, co-registered, and analyzed visually for new hyperintensities by raters blinded to clinical details. A PFO was classified as stroke-related in patients with PFO and a Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score >5 points. Results: Out of 80 cryptogenic stroke patients, risk of early recurrent DWI lesions was not significantly different in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. Similar results were observed in patients â¤60 years of age. Patients with a stroke-related PFO even had a significantly lower risk of early recurrent ischemic lesions compared to all other patients with cryptogenic stroke (unadjusted odds ratio 0.23 [95% confidence interval 0.06-0.87], P = 0.030). Conclusion: Our data argue against a high risk of early stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO.",An Initial Passive Phase That Limits the Time to Recover and Emphasizes the Role of Proprioceptive Information.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524363,Frontiers in neurology,2019 04 04,"In the present experiments, multiple balance perturbations were provided by unpredictable support-surface translations in various directions and velocities. The aim of this study was to distinguish the passive and the active phases during the pre-impact period of a fall. It was hypothesized that it should be feasible if one uses a specific quantitative kinematic analysis to evaluate the dispersion of the body segments trajectories across trials. Moreover, a multi-joint kinematical model was created for each subject, based on a new 3-D minimally invasive stereoradiographic X-ray images to assess subject-specific geometry and inertial parameters. The simulations allowed discriminating between the contributions of the passive (inertia-induced properties) and the active (neuromuscular response) components during falls. Our data show that there is limited time to adjust the way one fall from a standing position. We showed that the pre-impact period is truncated of 200 ms. During the initial part of a fall, the observed trajectory results from the interaction between the destabilizing external force and the body: inertial properties intrinsic to joints, ligaments and musculotendinous system have then a major contribution, as suggested for the regulation of static upright stance. This passive phase is later followed by an active phase, which consists of a corrective response to the postural perturbation. We believe that during a fall from standing height, it takes about 300 ms for postural responses to start correcting the body trajectory, while the impact is expected to occur around 700 ms. It has been argued that this time is sufficient to change the way one falls and that this makes it possible to apply safer ways of falling, for example by using martial arts fall techniques. Also, our results imply visual and vestibular information are not congruent with the beginning of the on-going fall. This consequence is to be noted as subjects prepare to the impact on the basis of sensory information, which would be uniquely mainly of proprioceptive origin at the fall onset. One limitation of the present analysis is that no EMG was included so far but these data are the subject of a future study.",A Novel Non-invasive Approach for Measuring Upper Airway Collapsibility in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524362,Frontiers in neurology,2018 12 17,"Introduction: Invasive procedures were previously developed for measuring pharyngeal collapsibility in rodents during expiration, when declining neuromuscular activity makes the airway unstable. We developed a non-invasive approach for streamlining collapsibility measurements by characterizing responses in physiologic markers of dynamic expiratory airflow obstruction to negative nasal pressure challenges. Methods: Anesthetized mice were instrumented to monitor upper airway pressure-flow relationships with head-out plethysmography while nasal pressure was ramped down from ~ +5 to -20 cm H2O over several breaths. Inspiratory and expiratory flow, volume, and timing characteristics were assessed breath-wise. Pcrit was estimated at transitions in expiratory amplitude and timing parameters, and compared to gold standard PCRIT measurements when nasal and tracheal pressures diverged during expiration. Predictions equations were constructed in a development data set (n = 8) and applied prospectively to a validation data set (n = 16) to estimate gold standard PCRIT. Results: The development data demonstrated that abrupt reversals in expiratory duration and tidal volume during nasal pressure ramps predicted gold standard PCRIT measurements. After applying regression equations from the development to a validation dataset, we found that a combination of expiratory amplitude and timing parameters proved to be robust predictors of gold standard PCRIT with minimal bias and narrow confidence intervals. Conclusions: Markers of expiratory airflow obstruction can be used to model upper airway collapsibility, and can provide sensitive measures of changes in airway collapsibility in rodents. This approach streamlines repeated non-invasive PCRIT measurements, and facilitates studies examining the impact of genetic, environmental, and pharmacologic factors on upper airway control.",Neurofilament Light Chain: Blood Biomarker of Neonatal Neuronal Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524361,Frontiers in neurology,2018 12 17,"Background: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a highly promising biomarker of neuroaxonal injury that has mainly been studied in adult neurodegenerative disease. Its involvement in neonatal disease remains largely unknown. Our aim was to establish NfL plasma concentrations in preterm and term infants in the first week of life. Methods: Plasma NfL was measured by single molecule array immunoassay in two neonatal cohorts: cohort 1 contained 203 term and preterm infants, median gestational age (GA) 37.9 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 31.9-39.4), in whom venous and arterial umbilical cord blood was sampled at birth and venous blood at day of life (DOL) 3; cohort 2 contained 98 preterm infants, median GA 29.3 weeks (IQR 26.9-30.6), in whom venous blood was sampled at DOL 7. Results: Median NfL concentrations in venous blood increased significantly from birth (18.2 pg/mL [IQR 12.8-30.8, cohort 1]) to DOL 3 (50.9 pg/mL [41.3-100, cohort 1]) and DOL 7 (126 pg/mL [78.8-225, cohort 2]) (p < 0.001). In both cohorts NfL correlated inversely with birth weight (BW, Spearman's rho -0.403, p < 0.001, cohort 1; R -0.525, p < 0.001, cohort 2) and GA (R -0.271, p < 0.001, cohort 1; R -0.487, p < 0.001, cohort 2). Additional significant correlations were found for maternal age at delivery, preeclampsia, delivery mode, 5-min Apgar, duration of oxygen supplementation, sepsis, and brain damage (intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the independent predictors of NfL in cohort 1 as BW (beta = -0.297, p = 0.003), delivery mode (beta = 0.237, p = 0.001) and preeclampsia (beta = 0.183, p = 0.022) and in cohort 2 as BW (beta = -0.385, p = 0.001) and brain damage (beta = 0.222, p = 0.015). Conclusion: Neonatal NfL levels correlate inversely with maturity and BW, increase during the first days of life, and relate to brain injury factors such as intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia, and also to vaginal delivery."

Forty inpatient and discharged aphasia patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the training group or control group. Computerized speech-language and cognitive training was provided for 14 days to the inpatients and 30 days to the discharged patients. Compared with the control group, training group had significantly more improved language function as assessed by the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and practical communication skills as assessed by the Communicative Abilities in Daily Living Test (CADL). It was also found that the positive effects of the computerized training when delivered via telerehabilitation to the discharged group were smaller than the effects when delivered on the inpatient unit. The results suggest that combining speech-language and cognitive training program is efficacious in promoting the recovery of patients with aphasia, both inpatients and discharged patients, and that the program works even when administered from a remote location.",An Empirical Analysis of Popular Press Claims Regarding Linguistic Change in President Donald J. Trump.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524348,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Linguistic features of a person's speech can change over time. It has been proposed that characteristics in the speech of President Donald J. Trump (DJT) have changed across time, though this claim has been based on subjective and anecdotal reports. A previous study of speech by Presidents of the United States identified an increase in the use of conversational fillers and non-specific nouns, and lower unique word counts, in the speech of President Ronald W. Reagan, but not in the speech of President George H.W. Bush. To empirically test claims of a systematic change in speech by DJT, we applied the same analysis by transcribing and analyzing publicly available Fox News interviews with DJT between 2011 and 2017. A regression analysis revealed a significant increase in the use of filler words by DJT over time. There was no significant change in numbers of unique words. The observed rise in filler words was significantly greater than filler-word change in President George H.W. Bush, and was not significantly different from the rise previously found in the speech of President Ronald W. Reagan. Identifying the reason for this linguistic change is not possible from speech samples alone, and the variables index linguistic change rather than being validated measures of change in cognitive ability. Nonetheless, features of the data such as the trajectory starting years before announcement of candidacy rule-out several potential explanations. To summarize, we find statistical evidence to support suggestions that speech by DJT has changed over time.",Side Biases in Euro Banknotes Recognition: The Horizontal Mapping of Monetary Value.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524347,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Money is a special stimulus for humans, because of its relevance in everyday life. However, the basic mechanisms underlying money representation have not yet been fully investigated. Left-right asymmetries in the visual perception and evaluation of monetary value offer such a possibility. The pattern of these asymmetries can contribute to disentangle between numerical and emotional processes possibly involved in banknotes perception. In the present experiment, we tested the recognition of 5â¬and 100â¬ banknotes presented in the left and right visual fields. Results show that the 100â¬ banknote is recognized faster than the 5â¬ banknote in the Right Visual Field (RVF), while there is no difference in the Left Visual Field (LVF). Our interpretation is that this effect is due to the matching between the positive valence conveyed by the 100â¬ banknote and the side in which it is mapped (right-positive). We consider this result as evidence of a valence-based recognition of banknotes.",Ten Years After Bariatric Surgery: Bad Quality of Life Promotes the Need of Psychological Interventions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524346,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Background: This study aims to evaluate long-term quality of life (QoL) and primary clinical outcomes, 10 years after biliointestinal bypass (BIB) surgery. It was expected that, although BIB might show encouraging primary outcomes, long term QoL could be significantly impaired. Methods: Ninety patients were contacted for a phone interview [age 41.0 Â± 10.6 (mean Â± SD) years, age-range 31-65 years]. QoL (by SF-36) and the clinical situation (by ad hoc questionnaire) were collected. Data were analyzed with SPSS 22. SF-36 scores were compared with Italian normative data from general and healthy population. We also compared primary clinical outcomes and SF-36 scores between patients who reported high and low levels of satisfaction with BIB. Results: Considering SF-36 results, patients showed significant impairments in QoL compared to general and healthy populations. Sixty-five percent would repeat the BIB. All patients showed at least one chronic adverse event. It occurred a significant decrease in pre-post co-occurrence rates of diabetes (Ï2 = 18.41; p < 0.001) and hypertension (Ï2 = 50.27; p < 0.001). Large and significant weight loss indexes (i.e., percent excess weight loss (%EWL); body mass index) were observed between pre-post intervention. Conclusion: BIB showed promising primary clinical outcomes (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, and weight loss). However, subjects reported a significant impairment in all SF-36 domains. Ad hoc psychological interventions should be implemented to ameliorate the quality of life of these patients.",Mechanisms of Epistemic Change-Under Which Circumstances Does Diverging Information Support Epistemic Development?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524345,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Background: The number of studies on how to foster change toward advanced epistemic beliefs (i.e., beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing) is continuously growing because these beliefs are an important predictor of learning outcomes. In past intervention studies, presenting diverging information (e.g., descriptions of studies yielding contradictory results) reliably led to epistemic change. However, prior research insufficiently examined which aspects of diverging information affect these changes. Aims: We investigated (1) if epistemic change differs depending on the (un)resolvability of contradictory information, (2) to what extent explicitly reflecting on diverging information supports epistemic change and (3) how topic-specific diverging information affects topic-and domain-specific epistemic beliefs. All confirmatory hypotheses were preregistered at OSF. Additionally, several exploratory analyses were conducted. Method: To examine the research questions, we employed a simple randomized pre-post design with four experimental groups. N = 185 psychology students participated in the study. Experimental groups differed in the kind of diverging information included: Students either read (1) information on students applying learning strategies (control), (2) unresolvable, or (3a) resolvable controversial information on gender stereotyping. In the latter condition (3b), an additional group of participants deliberately resolved apparent contradictions in a writing task. Results: Confirmatory latent change analyses revealed no significant group differences in epistemic change (i.e., beliefs in the control group also changed toward advanced epistemic beliefs). Using a different methodological approach, subsequent exploratory analyses nevertheless showed that presenting diverging information on gender stereotypes produced stronger topic-specific epistemic change and change in justification beliefs in the treatment groups in contrast to the control group. However, effects in the treatment groups did not differ significantly depending on the resolvability of presented controversies or for the group which was instructed explicitly to integrate controversial findings. Conclusion: Contrary to our expectations, diverging information seems to foster epistemic change toward advanced beliefs regardless of the resolvability of presented information, while no final conclusion concerning effects of reflection could be drawn. Moreover, our findings indicate that effects of topic-specific interventions are more pronounced on topic-specific measures. However, this relationship may vary depending on the epistemic belief dimension (e.g., justification beliefs) under investigation.",Ich kann nicht anders: Social Heroism as Nonselfsacrificial Practical Necessity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524344,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Most self-reports of heroic action in both reactive and social (proactive) cases describe the experience as involving a kind of necessity. This seems intuitively sound, but it makes it unclear why heroism is accorded strong approbation. To resolve this, I show that the necessity involved in heroism is a nonselfsacrificial practical necessity. (1) Approaching the intentional structure of human action from the perspective of embodiment, focusing especially on the predispositionality of pre-reflective skill, I develop a phenomenological interpretation of Bernard Williams' notion of ""practical necessity"" as an endogenous existential necessity. (2) I then offer a view of reactive heroism as instantiating this kind of necessity by literally embodying certain socially affirmed values in a way that is not self-sacrificial. This evinces a deep social bond, and it is this bond, rather than the action itself, that is the ground of approbation. (3) I then discuss how this construal of reactive heroism can be extended to cases of social heroism by way of a necessity that is internal to the agent's individual character. Similarly to reactive cases, a social hero literally embodies a certain ethical commitment such that her actions are likewise instances of nonselfsacrificial practical necessity. (4) I then discuss how the commitment perceived in cases of social heroism pertains to the actualization of ""surplus validity,"" such that whereas the reactive hero is praised for embodying shared value, the social hero is praised for embodying a commitment to actualizing the concrete potential of such value more fully The approbation accorded to social heroism is therefore tied inextricably to a normative judgment concerning such immanent progressive transformation.",Orthographic Networks in the Developing Mental Lexicon. Insights From Graph Theory and Implications for the Study of Language Processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524342,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"In this study, we examine the development of orthographic networks in the mental lexicon using graph theory. According to this view, words are represented by nodes in a network and connected as a function of their orthographic similarity. With a sampling approach based on a language corpus for German school children, we were able to simulate lexical development for children from Grade 1-8. By sampling different lexicon sizes from the corpus, we were able to analyze the content of the orthographic lexicon at different time points and examined network characteristics using graph theory. Results show that, similar to semantic and phonological networks, orthographic networks possess small-word characteristics defined by short average path lengths between nodes and strong local clustering. Moreover, the interconnectivity of the network decreases with growth. Implications for the study of the effect of network measures on language processing are discussed.",Assessment of Unilateral Spatial Neglect Using a Free Mobile Application for Italian Clinicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524341,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Background: Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN) is traditionally assessed with paper-and-pencil tests or computer-based tests. Thanks to the wide-spreading of mobile devices, and the extensive capabilities that they have in dealing complex elements, it is possible to provide clinicians with tools for cognitive assessment. Contemporary 3D engine is, in general generally, able to deploy complex 3D environments for iOS, Android and Windows mobile, i.e., most of the mobile phone and tablet operative systems. Results: This brand-new scenario and pressing requests from professionals, pushed us to build an application for the assessment of USN. Our first attempt was to replicate the classic cognitive tests, traditionally used at this purpose. Ecological assessment is difficult in real scenarios so we implemented virtual environments to assess patients' abilities in realistic situations. At the moment, the application is available only for iPad and iPhone for free, from the Apple Store, under the name of ""Neglect App."" The App contains traditional tests (e.g., barrage with and without distractors) and ecological tests (e.g., to distribute the tea in a table to close people). Scoring of each test is available to the clinicians through a database with the executed ecological tasks, that are stored locally. Conclusion: In conclusion, Neglect App is an advanced mobile platform for the assessment of Neglect.",Psychological Hibernation in Antarctica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524340,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Human activity in Antarctica has increased sharply in recent years. In particular during the winter months, people are exposed to long periods of isolation and confinement and an extreme physical environment that poses risks to health, well-being and performance. The present study aimed to gain a better understanding of processes contributing to psychological resilience in this context. Specifically, the study examined how the use of coping strategies changed over time, and the extent to which changes coincided with alterations in mood and sleep. Two crews (N = 27) spending approximately 10 months at the Concordia station completed the Utrecht Coping List, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and a structured sleep diary at regular intervals (x 9). The results showed that several variables reached a minimum value during the midwinter period, which corresponded to the third quarter of the expedition. The effect was particularly noticeable for coping strategies (i.e., active problem solving, palliative reactions, avoidance, and comforting cognitions). The pattern of results could indicate that participants during Antarctic over-wintering enter a state of psychological hibernation as a stress coping mechanism.",Comprehending Non-literal Language: Effects of Aging and Bilingualism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524339,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"A pressing issue that the twenty-first century is facing in many parts of the developed world is a rapidly aging population. Whilst several studies have looked at aging older adults and their language use in terms of vocabulary, syntax and sentence comprehension, few have focused on the comprehension of non-literal language (i.e., pragmatic inference-making) by aging older adults, and even fewer, if any, have explored the effects of bilingualism on pragmatic inferences of non-literal language by aging older bilinguals. Thus, the present study examined the effects of age(ing) and the effects of bilingualism on aging older adults' ability to infer non-literal meaning. Four groups of participants made up of monolingual English-speaking and bilingual English-Tamil speaking young (17-23 years) and older (60-83 years) adults were tested with pragmatic tasks that included non-conventional indirect requests, conversational implicatures, conventional metaphors and novel metaphors for both accuracy and efficiency in terms of response times. While the study did not find any significant difference between monolinguals and bilinguals on pragmatic inferences, there was a significant effect of age on one type of non-literal language tested: conventional metaphors. The effect of age was present only for the monolinguals with aging older monolinguals performing less well than the young monolinguals. Aging older bilingual adults were not affected by age whilst processing conventional metaphors. This suggests a bilingual advantage in pragmatic inferences of conventional metaphors."

While extant research streams remain equivocal on whether managing expectations always succeeds, this research examines situations in which setting a low expectation can have an adverse emotional impact and suggests ways to alleviate this negative consequence. Using goal setting and a false-feedback paradigm, we show that, although individuals who set low goals to manage expectations can end up feeling more disappointed than those who set high goals (study 1), this negative impact can be avoided when individuals are reminded of their initial goals at feedback, or made aware of inaccuracies in forecasting their future emotion (studies 1 and 2).",Psychosocial Hazards in the Workplace as an Aspect of Horizontal Segregation in the Nursing Profession.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524325,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 18,"The purpose of this article was to assess the influence of psychosocial hazards as a factor affecting the presence of men in the nursing profession. The article refers to the topic of particularly low representation of men among nursing staff in Poland, in comparison to what similar statistics show for other countries. The aim of the study was to assess whether the psychosocial hazards in the nursing profession constitute a significant factor in the small number of men present in this occupation. In this article psychosocial hazards are considered as all the aspects of management and work organization that may negatively affect the employee's mental and physical health. The research was conducted from September 2017 to April 2018 in the Podlaskie Voivodeship (Poland). A total of 640 respondents working as nurses in inpatient health care facilities, of which 87% were women and 13% were men, were included in the study. A standardized Work Design Questionnaire for an objective assessment of work stressfulness was used as a research tool. The research has been run by a group of experts, who explained the aim and the meaning of the particular questions to the surveyed group. Afterwards, based on the answers and observations of the responders, the experts filled in the questionnaire. The results of the study show that in almost all the evaluated aspects, the nursing profession was assessed more negatively by surveyed men than women. The most negative aspects reported by women included hazards (a score of 60), complexity (58.3), and haste (50.0), while those reported by men included haste (70.0), complexity (66.7), and hazards (65.0). As a conclusion it has been noticed, that results received from the research confirm that psychosocial hazards may have significant impact on the number of men present in the nursing profession in Poland. This study also suggests that the greater psychosocial hazards experienced by male nurses in the workplace may be an effect of the particularly low representation of men among practicing nursing staff.",Cognitive Profiles of Developmental Dysgraphia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524324,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Developmental dysgraphia is a disorder of writing/spelling skills, closely related to developmental dyslexia. For developmental dyslexia, profiles with a focus on phonological, attentional, visual or auditory deficits have recently been established. Unlike for developmental dyslexia, however, there are only few studies about dysgraphia, in particular about the variability of its causes. Research has demonstrated high similarity between developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate cognitive deficits as potential predictors of dysgraphia, analogously to those for dyslexia, in order to identify dysgraphia profiles, depending on the particular underlying disorder. Different tests were carried out with 3rd and 4th grade school children to assess their spelling abilities, tapping into phonological processing, auditory sound discrimination, visual attention and visual magnocellular functions as well as reading. A group of 45 children with developmental dysgraphia was compared to a control group. The results showed that besides phonological processing abilities, auditory skills and visual magnocellular functions affected spelling ability, too. Consequently, by means of a two-step cluster analysis, the group of dysgraphic children could be split into two distinct clusters, one with auditory deficits and the other with deficits in visual magnocellular functions. Visual attention was also related to spelling disabilities, but had no characteristic distinguishing effect for the two clusters. Together, these findings demonstrate that a more fine-grained diagnostic view on developmental dysgraphia, which takes the underlying cognitive profiles into account, might be advantageous for optimizing the outcome of individuum-centered intervention programs.",Moral Emotions and Social Economic Games in Paranoia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524323,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"Impaired social cognitive processes are putative psychological mechanisms implicated in the formation and maintenance of paranoid beliefs. Paranoia denotes unfounded fears about the hostile intentions of others and is prevalent in a significant proportion of the general population. We investigated social cognition in healthy participants selectively recruited to have a broad occurrence of paranoid thinking (n = 89). Participants completed a novel computerized task of moral emotions and two social economic exchange games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Ultimatum Game) from the EMOTICOM neuropsychological test battery. Regression analyses revealed that delusional ideation predicted shameful feelings when the victim of deliberate harm by another person. Cooperative behavior on the Prisoner's Dilemma was greatest when the participant and opponent contributed equally to joint earnings. Participants demonstrated significantly more punishment behavior when contributions were unequal and stole more from the opponent using a suspicious strategy of gameplay. In addition, paranoid thinking was positively associated with more stealing from the cooperative opponent. On the Ultimatum Game, participants accepted significantly more unequal offers when the opponent contributed more and sensitivity to fairness was greatest when the participant contributed more. These data demonstrate that delusional ideation predicts a maladaptive emotional response to interpersonal harm and that paranoid thinking may lead to reduced cooperation toward mutual reward. The effects of paranoia on moral emotions and pro-social behavior at more severe levels of persecutory thinking warrant further investigation.",Predictors of Persistent Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms: Findings From a General Population Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524322,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"Objective: To explore the persistency of Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS) and its prognostic factors in the general adult population. Knowledge of prognostic factors of MUS may indicate possible avenues for intervention development. Methods: Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a nationally representative face-to-face cohort study among the Dutch general population aged 18-64 years. We selected subjects with MUS at baseline and who participated at follow-up (N = 324) and reassessed those subjects for having MUS at 3 year follow-up. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine risk factors for persistency of MUS. Results: 36.4% of the subjects had persistent MUS at follow-up. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex and age, persistency of MUS was predicted by the number of comorbid chronic medical disorder(s), lower education, female sex, not having a paid job, parental psychopathology as well as lower functioning. In the logistic regression analysis in which all significant variables adjusted for sex and age were entered simultaneously, three variables predicted persistent MUS: parental psychopathology, the number of comorbid chronic medical disorder(s) and physical functioning, with odds ratios of 2.01 (1.20-3.38), 1.19 (1.01-1.40), and 0.99 (0.97-1.00), respectively. Conclusion: In the adult general population, MUS were persistent in over one third of the subjects with MUS at baseline. Persistency was significantly predicted by parental psychopathology, number of comorbid chronic medical disorders, and physical functioning. These findings warrant further research into early intervention and treatment options for persons with an increased risk of persistent MUS.",Screening for ADHD-Related Symptoms in Preschoolers Should Be Considered-Results From a Representative Sample of 5-Year-Olds From a German Metropolitan Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524321,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"Background: Early assessment and intervention are crucial to alleviate symptoms and prevent long-term negative outcomes in children suffering from Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In Germany, at present, no standardized screening for ADHD is routinely administered. This study aims to evaluate a potential screening measure in a study population that is representative for a primary school entrance exam population in a German metropolitan region. Methods: Based on various socio-demographic variables, a sample of n = 500 5-year-old children (58% boys, 42% girls), representative of a primary school entrance exam population from a German metropolitan region, was selected. Their parents completed a written survey consisting of the CBCL and a brief screening tool for ADHD symptomatology based on the DISYPS-II questionnaire. Demographic data were also collected. Results: The subscale ""Attention problems"" of the CBCL/4-18 showed results in the clinical range for n = 10 (2%) participants. The ADHD screening identified n = 23 (4.6%) participants as suspect of having ADHD with a statistically significant gender difference (n = 17 boys vs. n = 6 girls, p = 0.03). In n = 5 (1%) participants, all boys, both CBCL/4-18 and the ADHD screening were indicative of ADHD. Conclusions: Results indicate that screening for ADHD in this population may be both feasible and reasonable given the high prevalence and chronic nature of this disorder and the benefit of an early initiation of treatment. Results match previously reported figures for prevalence of ADHD-related symptoms and gender differences in preschool and older pediatric populations and thus do not support the hypothesis that the prevalence of ADHD in a metropolitan region is significantly higher than in other regions.",Serum Markers of Inflammation Mediate the Positive Association Between Neuroticism and Depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524320,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"Background: The personality trait neuroticism has been implicated in a poor response to stress, may relate to increased concentrations of cytokines and the development of depression. Inflammatory mechanisms may also be associated with the onset, severity and symptoms of depression. Both are related to poor antidepressant treatment outcome. Therefore, mediators of inflammation may bridge the relationship between neuroticism and depression. Methods: To disentangle these interrelationships, the associations between neuroticism (according to NEO-PIR-N), depressive symptoms (BDI-II scores) and serum levels of hsCRP, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, GM-CSF were investigated in a group of 212 participants, consisting of 37 depressed and 175 non-depressed subjects. A mediation model was used to investigate whether the impact of neuroticism on depressive symptoms may be mediated by cytokines. Results: Regression analyses revealed that IFN-Î³, IL-5, and IL-12-levels, but none of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, were associated with the overall neuroticism score and several of the cytokines were related to the different facets of neuroticism. TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-5, IL-12, and IL-13 were further related to the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as the somatic-affective and the cognitive dimensions of depression. Pro-inflammatory IFN-Î³, IL-5 and IL-12 were identified as mediators of the positive prediction of depression severity by the degree of neuroticism. Conclusions: The current findings demonstrate that conditions related to long-term stress, such as depression and high neuroticism, are related to an up-regulation of inflammatory agents. Neuroticism may increase stress perception and, thus, increase the production of pro-inflammatory messenger molecules which are involved in the development of depression. This evidence may contribute to future anti-inflammatory interventions, particularly in subjects with high neuroticism who are at risk for developing depression. Furthermore, depressed patients with high neuroticism and cytokine levels may require early escalations in the intensity of treatment, along with additional therapeutic elements to increase the rate of treatment success.",Drug Addiction: From Neuroscience to Ethics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524319,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"In the present paper, we suggest a potential new ethical analysis of addiction focusing on the relationship between aware and unaware processing in the brain. We take the case of the opioids epidemics to argue that a consideration of both aware and unaware processing provides a more comprehensive ethical framework to discuss the ethical issues raised by addiction. Finally, our hypothesis is that in addition to identified Central Nervous System's neuronal/neurochemical factors contributing to addictive dynamics, the socio-economic status plays a causal role through epigenetic processes, originating the need for additional reward in the brain. This provides a strong base for a socio-political form of responsibility for preventing and managing addiction crisis.",Latent Psychotic Symptom Profiles Amongst People Who Use Methamphetamine: What Do They Tell Us About Existing Diagnostic Categories?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524318,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"The inability to distinguish clearly between methamphetamine-related psychosis and schizophrenia has led to the suggestion that ""methamphetamine psychosis"" does not represent a distinct diagnostic entity but rather that the drug has triggered a vulnerability to schizophrenia. We tested this possibility by exploring the latent class structure of psychotic symptoms amongst people who use the drug and examining how these latent symptom profiles correspond to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Latent class analysis was carried out on the lifetime psychotic symptoms of 554 current methamphetamine users, of whom 40 met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Lifetime diagnoses of schizophrenia and individual psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The chosen model found 22% of participants had a high propensity to experience a wide range of psychotic symptoms (schizophrenia-like), whereas the majority (56%) more specifically experienced persecutory delusions and hallucinations (paranoid psychosis) and had a lower probability of these symptoms than the schizophrenia-like class. A third class (22%) had a low probability of all symptoms, with the exception of 34% reporting persecutory delusions. Participants in the schizophrenia-like class were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (26 vs. 3 and 1% for each of the other classes, p < 0.001) but the diagnosis failed to encompass 74% of this group. These results are consistent with there being a distinction between schizophrenia and methamphetamine-related psychotic symptoms, both in terms of the propensity to experience psychotic symptoms, as well as the symptom profile; however, this distinction may not be captured well by existing diagnostic classifications.",Baclofen Response in Alcohol Dependent Patients Concurrently Receiving Antidepressants: Secondary Analysis From the BacALD Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524317,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 17,"Background and Aims: There is little information with regards to the efficacy of baclofen among alcohol patients concurrently receiving antidepressants (AD). The present study aimed to conduct a secondary analysis of the moderating role of antidepressants in the BacALD trial which evaluated the efficacy of baclofen to reduce alcohol consumption in alcohol dependent patients. Methods: Alcohol dependent patients (N = 104) were treated for 12 weeks with 30 mg/day of baclofen (21 = AD and 15 = no AD), 75 mg baclofen (19 = AD and 16 = no AD) or placebo (17 = AD and 16 = no AD). Patients were included in the trial if they were concurrently receiving anti-depressants upon enrolment but were excluded if they commenced antidepressants 2 months prior to enrolment. Patients were also excluded in the case of concurrent psychotropic medications, active major mental disorder such as bipolar disorder, psychosis, or history of suicide attempt. Predefined primary outcomes included time to lapse (any drinking), relapse (>5 drinks per day in men and >4 in women). Other outcomes included drinks per drinking day, number of heavy drinking days, and percentage days abstinent and frequency of adverse events. Results: For the number of days to first lapse, there was a trend of significance for the interaction baclofen Ã AD (Log Rank: Ï2 = 2.98, P = 0.08, OR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.15-1.12). For the number of days to relapse, there was a trend of significance for the interaction of baclofen Ã AD (Log Rank: Ï2 = 3.72, P = 0.05, OR: 3.40, 95%CI: 1.01-11.46). Placing significant baseline variables into the models as covariates (tobacco, ALD) weakened these interactions (P's > 0.15). There were no significant effects of ADs on the frequency of adverse events reported (P's > 0.19). Conclusion: Concurrent receipt of ADs commenced more than 2 months prior to baclofen treatment did not negatively impact on drinking outcomes. Future research examining the interaction between commencing ADs during baclofen treatment on alcohol dependent patients is required.

LTBD patients may be at risk for vascular calcification, and cardiovascular disease. Current therapy for chronic kidney disease metabolic bone disorders (CKD-MBD) is guided by biochemical parameters, as bone biopsy is not used in routine clinical care. Methods: We assessed intact PTH (iPTH: 1-84PTH plus non-1-84PTH), 1-84PTH, and the 1-84PTH/non-1-84PTH ratio in 129 hemodialysis and 73 PD prevalent patients dialyzed with solutions containing 1.75 mmol/L calcium. Results: Hemodialysis and PD patients presented similar iPTH and tCa values and prevalence of putative LTBD as defined according to KDOQI iPTH cut-off levels or 1-84 PTH levels. However, iCa accounted for a higher percentage of tCa in PD (53%) than in hemodialysis (39%) p < 0.001, and the 1-84PTH/non-1-84PTH ratio was lower in PD than in hemodialysis patients (0.44 Â± 0.12) vs. (0.60 Â± 0.10), p < 0.001. The prevalence of putative LTBD when using the coexistence of 1-84PTH/non-1-84PTH ratio < 1.0 and iPTH < 420 pg/m, was higher in PD than in hemodialysis patients (73 vs. 16% respectively, p < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, dialysis modality was the main determinant of the 1-84PTH/non-1-84PTH ratio. Conclusion: Solutions containing 1.75 mmol/L calciums are associated to a higher proportion of non-1-84PTH fragments in PD than in HD patients. Different analytical criteria result in widely different estimates of LTBD prevalence, thus impairing the ability of clinicians to optimize therapy for CKD-MBD.",Dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation Remains Stable During the Daytime (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) in Healthy Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524305,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Many functions of the human body possess a daily rhythm, disruptions of which often lead to disease. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) stabilizes the cerebral blood flow to prompt normal neural function. However, whether dCA is stable across the day remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the daily rhythm of dCA. Fifty-one healthy adults (38.294 Â± 13.279 years, 40 females) were recruited and received six dCA measurements per individual that were conducted at predefined time points: 8:00, 9:00, 11:00, 14:00, 17:00, and 20:00. Although the blood pressure fluctuated significantly, there was no statistical difference in phase difference and gain (autoregulatory parameters) across the six time points. This study demonstrates that dCA remains stable during the interval from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and underscores the importance of stable dCA in maintaining cerebral blood flow and neural function.",Targeted Ablation of Distal Cerebrospinal Fluid-Contacting Nucleus Alleviates Renal Fibrosis in Chronic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524304,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"The potential function of distal cerebrospinal fluid-contacting nucleus (dCSF-CNs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) development is poorly understood. We hypothesized that dCSF-CNs might affect the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in kidney injury progression, with dCSF-CNs ablation potentially alleviating local RAS and renal fibrosis in rats after five-sixths nephrectomy (5/6Nx). Part of rats were randomly administered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) intracerebroventricularly (icv), followed by 5/6Nx or sham operation; and other part of rats were administered Cholera toxin B subunit conjugated with saporin (CB-SAP) for dCSF-CNs lesion before 5/6Nx. The effect of CB-SAP on dCSF-CNs ablation was confirmed by double immunofluorescence staining. RAS component, NOX2 and c-fos levels in the subfornical organ (SFO), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and hippocampus, as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and c-fos positive cells in rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) were assessed. Next, the levels of RAS components (angiotensinogen [AGT], angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE], Ang II type 1 receptor [AT1R], angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2], and Mas receptor), NADPH oxidases (NOX2 and catalase), inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP-1] and IL-6), and fibrotic factors (fibronectin and collagen I) were assessed. Less CB-labeled neurons were found in dCSF-CNs of CB-SAP-treated rats compared with 5/6Nx animals. Meanwhile, CB-SAP downregulated AGT, Ang II, AT1R, NOX2, catalase, MCP-1, IL-6, fibronectin, and collagen I, and upregulated ACE2 and Mas receptor, compared with CKD rats. More TH and c-fos positive cells were found in RVLM of 5/6Nx rats but the number decreased after dCSF-CNs ablation. Targeted dCSF-CNs ablation could alleviate renal inflammation and fibrosis in chronic kidney injury by inhibiting cerebral and renal RAS/NADPH oxidase.",DLX3 Inhibits the Proliferation of Human Dental Pulp Cells Through Inactivation of Canonical Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524303,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Homeodomain gene Distal-less-3 (Dlx3) plays an important role during tooth development. Our previous studies indicate that DLX3 inhibits proliferation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). However, the mechanism of DLX3 regulating proliferation of hDPCs and maintaining the quiescence of the cells remain unknown. Given the importance of canonical Wnt signaling in the proliferation of dental pulp cell and tooth development, we hypothesized that DLX3 inhibited proliferation of hDPCs through inactivation of canonical Wnt signaling. With overexpression or knock-down of DLX3 in primary hDPCs, we found DLX3 down regulated canonical Wnt signaling and its downstream target genes. And when the DLX3 overexpressed-cells were treated with lithium chloride, the proliferation inhibition by DLX3 was reversed. We also found that DLX3 enhanced the expression of DKK1 and the reduced proliferation of hDPCs by DLX3 was reversed with knock-down of DKK1. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed DLX3 was able to bind to Dkk1 promoter region from nucleotides (nt) -1656 to -1245, and stimulated Dkk1 promoter activity. Mutagenesis studies further revealed two DLX3 responsive elements in Dkk1 promoter. Taken together, our data indicate that DLX3 inhibits proliferation of hDPCs via inactivation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway by directly binding to Dkk1 promoter and increasing its expression.",Relationships Between Aerobic and Anaerobic Parameters With Game Technical Performance in Elite Goalball Athletes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524302,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Our aims were to compare physiological parameters from the laboratory environment (LaB) and simulated goalball games (GaM), test relationships between physiological parameters in the laboratory and game technical performance (GTP), and examine the associations between physiological and technical responses during games. Seven elite athletes from the Brazilian National Team performed in LaB environment; (i) an incremental test to determine peak oxygen consumption (O2PEAK), its corresponding speed, and peak blood lactate concentration and (ii) submaximal and supramaximal efforts to estimate maximal anaerobic contribution (AnC). In GaM condition, simulated games were also performed to determine physiological responses throughout the game, and to analyze the GTP (number of throws, defenses, recovery, and density of actions). No correlations (unclear) were found between laboratory and games analyses for O2PEAK [47.3 (17.2) vs. 25.8 (18.2) mLâKg-1âmin-1], peak blood lactate concentrations [10.2 (5.4) vs. 2.0 (0.7) mM], and total AnC [21.0 (14.0) vs. 4.8 (6.1) mL Kg-1]. O2PEAK in the laboratory condition presented very likely correlations with throw and recovery frequency in games (r = -0.87 and confidence interval [CI] = 0.41; r = -0.90 and CI = 0.35; respectively). Oxygen consumption remained above baseline while blood lactate concentration remained unchanged during the games. The very likely correlation between anaerobic alactic contribution and action density (r = 0.95 and CI = 0.25) highlights the importance of the alactic metabolism. In general, our study demonstrates that goalball can be characterized as a high-intensity intermittent effort, where athlete performance is based on aerobic metabolism predominance while determinant actions are supplied by the anaerobic alactic metabolism. Specifically, higher values of LaB vs. GaM highlighted the need for standardization of specific protocols for goalball evaluation, mainly for the reproduction of ecologically valid values. In addition, O2PEAK correlated with recovery frequency in the LaB condition, demonstrating that passive or low-intensity recovery between actions is fundamental to maintain performance.",Inflammation and Mechanical Stress Stimulate Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Aortic Valve Interstitial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524301,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 28,"Background: Aortic valve calcification is an active proliferative process, where interstitial cells of the valve transform into either myofibroblasts or osteoblast-like cells causing valve deformation, thickening of cusps and finally stenosis. This process may be triggered by several factors including inflammation, mechanical stress or interaction of cells with certain components of extracellular matrix. The matrix is different on the two sides of the valve leaflets. We hypothesize that inflammation and mechanical stress stimulate osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) and this may depend on the side of the leaflet. Methods: Interstitial cells isolated from healthy and calcified human aortic valves were cultured on collagen or elastin coated plates with flexible bottoms, simulating the matrix on the aortic and ventricular side of the valve leaflets, respectively. The cells were subjected to 10% stretch at 1 Hz (FlexCell bioreactor) or treated with 0.1 Î¼g/ml lipopolysaccharide, or both during 24 h. Gene expression of myofibroblast- and osteoblast-specific genes was analyzed by qPCR. VICs cultured in presence of osteogenic medium together with lipopolysaccharide, 10% stretch or both for 14 days were stained for calcification using Alizarin Red. Results: Treatment with lipopolysaccharide increased expression of osteogenic gene bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) (5-fold increase from control; p = 0.02) and decreased expression of mRNA of myofibroblastic markers: Î±-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) (50% reduction from control; p = 0.0006) and calponin (CNN1) (80% reduction from control; p = 0.0001) when cells from calcified valves were cultured on collagen, but not on elastin. Mechanical stretch of VICs cultured on collagen augmented the effect of lipopolysaccharide. Expression of periostin (POSTN) was inhibited in cells from calcified donors after treatment with lipopolysaccharide on collagen (70% reduction from control, p = 0.001), but not on elastin. Lipopolysaccharide and stretch both enhanced the pro-calcific effect of osteogenic medium, further increasing the effect when combined for cells cultured on collagen, but not on elastin. Conclusion: Inflammation and mechanical stress trigger expression of osteogenic genes in VICs in a side-specific manner, while inhibiting the myofibroblastic pathway. Stretch and lipopolysaccharide synergistically increase calcification.",Marine Mammals' NMDA Receptor Structure: Possible Adaptation to High Pressure Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524300,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Divers that are exposed to high pressure (HP) above 1.1 MPa suffer from High Pressure Neurological Syndrome (HPNS), which is implicated with central nervous system (CNS) malfunction. Marine mammals performing extended and deep breath-hold dives are exposed to almost 20 MPa without apparent HPNS symptoms. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has repeatedly been implicated as one of the major factors in CNS hyperexcitability as part of HPNS. Electrophysiological studies in rat brain slices at He HP showed a significant increase in the synaptic NMDAR response, followed by postsynaptic excitability changes. Molecular studies of Rattus norvegicus NMDARs have revealed that different subunit combinations of the NMDAR exhibit different, increased or decreased, current responses under He HP conditions. The purpose of the present research was to disclose if the breath-hold deep diving mammals exhibit NMDAR structural modifications related to HP. We used sequence alignment and homology structure modeling in order to compare deep diving marine mammals' NMDARs to those of terrestrial mammals. We discovered that deep diving mammals have a special tertiary TMD structure of the GluN2A subunit that differs from that of the terrestrial mammals. In addition, the GluN2A subunit has a group of four conserved a.a. substitutions: V68L (N-terminal domain, NTD) and V440I (agonist-binding domain, ABD) are cetacean specific, E308D (N-terminal domain, NTD) and I816V (transmembrane domain, TMD) were also singularly found in some terrestrial mammals. Since I816V is localized in M4 Î±-helix region, which is critical for NMDAR activation and desensitization, we hypothesize that the presence of all 4 substitutions rather than a single one, is the combination that may enable HP tolerance. Furthermore, additional special substitutions that were found in the marine mammals' NTD may affect the Zn2+ binding site, suggesting less or no voltage-independent inhibition by this ion. Our molecular studies of NMDARs containing the GluN2A subunit showed that HP removal of the Zn2+ voltage-independent inhibition could be the mechanism explaining its current increase at HP. Thus, this mechanism could play a crucial role in the CNS hyperexcitability at HP. Less or no voltage-independent Zn2+ inhibition, different conformations of the TMD, and special mutation in the M4 Î±-helix region of cetaceans' NMDAR, may give them the advantage they need in order to perform such deep dives without CNS malfunction.",Leucine Supplementation Improves Effort Tolerance of Rats With Hyperthyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524299,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Leucine is a regulator of protein metabolism in vivo and information on its action on effort tolerance of both animals and humans with hyperthyroidism is scarce. The objective of the present study was to verify the influence of leucine supplementation on the effort tolerance of Wistar rats with experimental hyperthyroidism. 40 animals were divided into four groups of ten: control (C), hormone (H), leucine (L), and hormone + leucine (HL). Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily administration of 20 Î¼âg100 g-1 of levothyroxine sodium in aqueous suspension by gavage. Leucine was supplemented by adding 5% of the amino acid to the conventional feed. The animals' blood was collected by cardiac puncture to analyze TSH, T4, and T3 levels. The effort tolerance was determined by the swimming test with a 7% load attached to animals' tails. Statistical analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, followed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures of two factors (treatment Ã time) and Tukey post hoc, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Administering thyroid hormone increased the swimming performance of rats after 14 and 21 days, but with a drop in performance at 28 days. The HL group, on the other hand, had a significantly higher swimming performance compared to the other groups after 28 days of treatment. Leucine supplementation associated with the experimental model of hyperthyroidism improved the performance of rats in a swimming test after 28 days of treatment.",Properties of the Permeability Transition of Pea Stem Mitochondria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524297,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"In striking analogy with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, etiolated pea stem mitochondria did not show appreciable Ca2+ uptake. Only treatment with the ionophore ETH129 (which allows electrophoretic Ca2+ equilibration) caused Ca2+ uptake followed by increased inner membrane permeability, membrane depolarization and Ca2+ release. Like the permeability transition (PT) of mammals, yeast and Drosophila, the PT of pea stem mitochondria was stimulated by diamide and phenylarsine oxide and inhibited by Mg-ADP and Mg-ATP, suggesting a common underlying mechanism; yet, the plant PT also displayed distinctive features: (i) as in mammals it was desensitized by cyclosporin A, which does not affect the PT of yeast and Drosophila; (ii) similarly to S. cerevisiae and Drosophila it was inhibited by Pi, which stimulates the PT of mammals; (iii) like in mammals and Drosophila it was sensitized by benzodiazepine 423, which is ineffective in S. cerevisiae; (iv) like what observed in Drosophila it did not mediate swelling and cytochrome c release, which is instead seen in mammals and S. cerevisiae. We find that cyclophilin D, the mitochondrial receptor for cyclosporin A, is present in pea stem mitochondria. These results indicate that the plant PT has unique features and suggest that, as in Drosophila, it may provide pea stem mitochondria with a Ca2+ release channel.",Glycolytic Response to Inflammation Over Time: Role of Myeloid HIF-1alpha.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524296,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"The in vivo response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occurs rapidly and has profound physiological and metabolic effects. The hypoxia inducible (HIF) transcription factor is an intrinsic and essential part of inflammation, and is induced by LPS. To determine the importance of the HIF response in regulating metabolism following an LPS response, glucose uptake was quantified in a time dependent manner in mice lacking HIF-1Î± in myeloid cells. We found that deletion of HIF-1Î± has an acute protective effect on LPS-induced hypoglycemia. Furthermore, reduced glucose uptake was observed in the heart and brown fat, in a time dependent manner, following loss of HIF-1Î±. To determine the physiological significance of these findings, cardiovascular, body temperature, and blood pressure changes were subsequently quantified in real time using radiotelemetry measurements. These studies reveal the temporal aspects of HIF-1Î± as a regulator of the metabolic response to acute LPS-induced inflammation."

Over the last few years, the development of MicroRNA (miRNA) technologies has become an essential part of research projects and their role as potential molecular biomarkers is being investigated by the scientific community. The circulating miRNAs detection as a diagnostic or prognostic tool for the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases is very useful, because with a minimal quantity of sample (peripheral blood), miRNAs are very sensitive. Even more, miRNAs remain stable both at room temperature and during freeze-thaw cycles. These characteristics highlight the important role of miRNAs in the near future as new tools for anti-doping.

However, how LRK works in HMG patients is unclear. To explore the possible mechanisms of LRK against HMG, the network pharmacology was used to screen the potential targets and possible pathways that involved in LRK treated HMG. Rat HMG model induced by estrogen and progesterone was used to further verify the effects of the key molecules of LRK selected from the enriched pathways on HMG. Nipple heights and diameters were measured and uterus index was calculated. The histopathological changes of mammary gland tissue were detected by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and P38. And immunohistochemistry staining was performed to evaluate the levels of estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±), progesterone receptor (PR), nuclear factor-(NF-)ÎºB (p65), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), cyclooxygenases 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and nitrotyrosine (NT). Our results indicate that LRK treatment rescues significantly nipples height and diameter, decreases uterus index and ameliorates HMG. LRK treatment also markedly attenuates the over-expression of IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, COX-2, and iNOS, and suppressed the formation of 8-OHdG and NT. Furthermore, LRK treatment significantly inhibits the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 and expression of NF-ÎºB (p65), interestingly, LRK treatment has no effect on the expression of ERÎ± and PR. Our data suggest that the LRK treatment protects the mammary glands from the damage of oxidative stress and inflammation induced by estrogen and progesterone, via suppresses of MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways without affecting on the expression of ERÎ± and PR.","Involvement of CYP2E1 in the Course of Brain Edema Induced by Subacute Poisoning With 1,2-Dichloroethane in Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524279,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"This study was designed to explore the role of cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) expression in the course of brain edema induced by subacute poisoning with 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). Mice were randomly divided into five groups: the control group, the 1,2-DCE poisoned group, and the low-, medium- and high-dose diallyl sulfide (DAS) intervention groups. The present study found that CYP2E1 expression levels in the brains of the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group were upregulated transcriptionally; in contrast, the levels were suppressed by DAS pretreatment in the intervention groups. In addition, the expression levels of both Nrf2 and HO-1 were also upregulated transcriptionally in the brains of the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group, while they were suppressed dose-dependently in the intervention groups. Moreover, compared with the control group, MDA levels and water contents in the brains of the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group increased, whereas NPSH levels and tight junction (TJ) protein levels decreased significantly. Conversely, compared with the 1,2-DCE- poisoned group, MDA levels and water contents in the brains of the intervention groups decreased, and NPSH levels and TJ protein levels increased significantly. Furthermore, pathological changes of brain edema observed in the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group were markedly improved in the intervention groups. Collectively, our results suggested that CYP2E1 expression could be transcriptionally upregulated in 1,2-DCE-poisoned mice, which might enhance 1,2-DCE metabolism in vivo, and induce oxidative damage and TJ disruption in the brain, ultimately leading to brain edema.",High Doses of Bupleurum falcatum Partially Prevents Estrogen Deficiency-Induced Bone Loss With Anti-osteoclastogenic Activity Due to Enhanced iNOS/NO Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524278,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"Background and Objective:Bupleurum falcatum (BF) extract, a natural product with anti-inflammatory properties, has been traditionally used to treat menopausal symptoms, but its role in osteoporosis, another serious health concern of menopausal women, remains unknown. Here we investigated whether and how BF prevents estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss using both in vitro and in vivo models. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and subjected to oral BF treatment daily for 8 weeks. Additionally, pre-osteoclastic RAW 264.7 cells were employed to evaluate the effects of BF and its underlying mechanism on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation in vitro. Results: A high dose of BF partially prevented ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss and reduced the levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in serum and osteoclast numbers in femurs of OVX rats. Furthermore, BF clearly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity in RAW 264.7 cells. BF also inhibited the osteoclastogenic transcription factors c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) and, consequently, downregulated the expression of osteoclast marker genes. Moreover, BF upregulated interferon-Î² (IFN-Î²)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling, even though it had no impact on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) or NF-ÎºB. The inhibition of osteoclast formation by BF was abrogated by iNOS-specific inhibitors. Consistent with cellular studies, BF upregulated iNOS protein expression in femurs from OVX rats. Conclusion: Taken together, our results indicate that BF partially prevented estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss with anti-osteoclastogenic activity potentially due to enhanced iNOS/NO signaling.",A Systematic Review of Medication Adherence Thresholds Dependent of Clinical Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524276,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"Background: In pharmacotherapy, the achievement of a target clinical outcome requires a certain level of medication intake or adherence. Based on Haynes's early empirical definition of sufficient adherence to antihypertensive medications as taking â¥80% of medication, many researchers used this threshold to distinguish adherent from non-adherent patients. However, we propose that different diseases, medications and patient's characteristics influence the cut-off point of the adherence rate above which the clinical outcome is satisfactory (thereafter medication adherence threshold). Moreover, the assessment of adherence and clinical outcomes may differ greatly and should be taken into consideration. To our knowledge, very few studies have defined adherence rates linked to clinical outcomes. We aimed at investigating medication adherence thresholds in relation to clinical outcomes. Method: We searched for studies that determined the relationship between adherence rates and clinical outcomes in the databases PubMed, Embaseâ and Web of Scienceâ¢ until December 2017, limited to English-language. Our outcome measure was any threshold value of adherence. The inclusion criteria of the retrieved studies were (1) any measurement of medication adherence, (2) any assessment of clinical outcomes, and (3) any method to define medication adherence thresholds in relation to clinical outcomes. We excluded articles considered as a tutorial. Two authors (PB and IA) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, reviewed full-texts, and extracted items. The results of the included studies are presented qualitatively. Result: We analyzed 6 articles that assessed clinical outcomes linked to adherence rates in 7 chronic disease states. Medication adherence was measured with Medication Possession Ratio (MPR, n = 3), Proportion of Days Covered (PDC, n = 1), both (n = 1), or Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Clinical outcomes were event free episodes, hospitalization, cortisone use, reported symptoms and reduction of lipid levels. To find the relationship between the targeted clinical outcome and adherence rates, three studies applied logistic regression and three used survival analysis. Five studies defined adherence thresholds between 46 and 92%. One study confirmed the 80% threshold as valid to distinguish adherent from non-adherent patients. Conclusion: The analyzed studies were highly heterogeneous, predominantly concerning methods of calculating adherence. We could not compare studies quantitatively, mostly because adherence rates could not be standardized. Therefore, we cannot reject or confirm the validity of the historical 80% threshold. Nevertheless, the 80% threshold was clearly questioned as a general standard.",Resveratrol Brain Delivery for Neurological Disorders Prevention and Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524273,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"Resveratrol (RES) is a natural polyphenolic non-flavonoid compound present in grapes, mulberries, peanuts, rhubarb and in several other plants. Numerous health effects have been related with its intake, such as anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and brain protective effects. The neuroprotective effects of RES in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases, are related to the protection of neurons against oxidative damage and toxicity, and to the prevention of apoptotic neuronal death. In brain cancer, RES induces cell apoptotic death and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor invasion. Despite its great potential as therapeutic agent for the treatment of several diseases, RES exhibits some limitations. It has poor water solubility and it is chemically instable, being degraded by isomerization once exposed to high temperatures, pH changes, UV light, or certain types of enzymes. Thus, RES has low bioavailability, limiting its biological and pharmacological benefits. To overcome these limitations, RES can be delivered by nanocarriers. This field of nanomedicine studies how the drug administration, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics are affected by the use of nanosized materials. The role of nanotechnology, in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases, arises from the necessity to mask the physicochemical properties of therapeutic drugs to prolong the half-life and to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This can be achieved by encapsulating the drug in a nanoparticle (NP), which can be made of different kinds of materials. An increasing trend to encapsulate and direct RES to the brain has been observed. RES has been encapsulated in many different types of nanosystems, as liposomes, lipid and polymeric NPs. Furthermore, some of these nanocarriers have been modified with targeting molecules able to recognize the brain areas. Then, this article aims to overview the RES benefits and limitations in the treatment of neurological diseases, as the different nanotechnology strategies to overcome these limitations.",Recent Advances in Herbal Medicines for Digestive System Malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524272,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"Herbal medicines, as an important part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been used to treat digestive system malignancies (DSM) for many years, and have gradually gained recognition worldwide. The role of herbal medicines in the comprehensive treatment of DSM is being improved from adjuvant treatment of the autologous immune function in cancer patients, to the treatment of both the symptoms and disease, direct inhibition of tumor cell growth and proliferation, and induction of tumor cell autophagy and apoptosis. Their specific mechanisms in these treatments are also being explored. The paper reviews the current anti-tumor mechanisms of TCM, including single herbal medicines, Chinese herbal formulations, Chinese medicine preparations and TCM extract, and their application in the comprehensive treatment of digestive system tumors, providing a reference for clinical application of TCM.","Cannabinoid Receptor 2 Signalling Bias Elicited by 2,4,6-Trisubstituted 1,3,5-Triazines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524271,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is predominantly distributed in immune tissues and cells and is a promising therapeutic target for modulating inflammation. In this study we designed and synthesised a series of 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines with piperazinylalkyl or 1,2-diethoxyethane (PEG2) chains as CB2 agonists, all of which were predicted to be considerably more polar than typical cannabinoid ligands. In this series, we found that triazines containing an adamantanyl group were conducive to CB2 binding whereas those with a cyclopentyl group were not. Although the covalent attachment of a PEG2 linker to the adamantyl triazines resulted in a decrease in binding affinity, some of the ligands produced very interesting hCB2 signalling profiles. Six compounds with notable hCB2 orthosteric binding were functionally characterised in three pathways; internalisation, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and ERK phosphorylation (pERK). These were predominantly confirmed to be hCB2 agonists, and upon comparison to a reference ligand (CP 55,940), four compounds exhibited signalling bias. Triazines 14 (UOSD017) and 15 were biased towards internalisation over cAMP and pERK, and 7 was biased away from pERK activation relative to cAMP and internalisation. Intriguingly, the triazine with an amino-PEG2-piperazinyl linker (13 [UOSD008]) was identified to be a mixed agonist/inverse agonist, exhibiting apparent neutral antagonism in the internalisation pathway, transient inverse agonism in the cAMP pathway and weak partial agonism in the pERK pathway. Both the cAMP and pERK signalling were pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive, implying that 13 is acting as both a weak agonist and inverse agonist at CB2 via GÎ±i/o. Compound 10 (UOSD015) acted as a balanced high intrinsic efficacy agonist with the potential to produce greater hCB2-mediated efficacy than reference ligand CP 55,940. As 10 includes a Boc-protected PEG2 moiety it is also a promising candidate for further modification, for example with a secondary reporter or fluorophore. The highest affinity compound in this set of relatively polar hCB2 ligands was compound 16, which acted as a slightly partial balanced agonist in comparison with CP 55,940. The ligands characterised here may therefore exhibit unique functional properties in vivo and have the potential to be valuable in the future development of CB2-directed therapeutics.","Quantifying Dynamic Balance in Young, Elderly and Parkinson's Individuals: A Systematic Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524270,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Introduction: Falling is one of the primary concerns for people with Parkinson's Disease and occurs predominately during dynamic movements, such as walking. Several methods have been proposed to quantify dynamic balance and to assess fall risk. However, no consensus has been reached concerning which method is most appropriate for examining walking balance during unperturbed and perturbed conditions, particularly in Parkinson's Disease individuals. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to assess the current literature on quantifying dynamic balance in healthy young, elderly and Parkinson's individuals during unperturbed and perturbed walking. Methods: The PubMed database was searched by title and abstract for publications quantifying dynamic balance during unperturbed and mechanically perturbed walking conditions in elderly adults and PD. Inclusion criteria required publications to be published in English, be available in full-text, and implement a dynamic balance quantification method. Exclusion criteria included clinical dynamic balance measures, non-mechanical perturbations, pathologies other than PD, and dual-tasking conditions. The initial database search yielded 280 articles, however, only 81 articles were included after title, abstract and full-text screening. Methodological quality and data were extracted from publications included in the final synthesis. Results: The dynamic balance articles included 26 Coefficient of Variation of Spatiotemporal Variability, 10 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, 20 Lyapunov Exponent, 7 Maximum Floquet Multipliers, 17 Extrapolated Center of Mass, 11 Harmonic Ratios, 4 Center of Mass-Center of Pressure Separation, 2 Gait Stability Ratio, 1 Entropy, 3 Spatiotemporal Variables, 2 Center of Gravity and Center of Pressure, and 2 Root Mean Square in the final synthesis. Assessment of methodological quality determined that 58 articles had a low methodological rating, a 22 moderate rating, and 1 having a high rating. Conclusion: Careful consideration must be given when selecting a method to quantify dynamic balance because each method defines balance differently, reflects a unique aspect of neuromuscular stability mechanisms, and is dependent on the walking condition (unperturbed vs. perturbed). Therefore, each method provides distinct information into stability impairment in elderly and PD individuals.",Levels of Cortisol in CSF Are Associated With SNAP-25 and Tau Pathology but Not Amyloid-Î².,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524269,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Objective: Preclinical studies have found both hyperactivity of hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis and synaptic degeneration are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the data on the relationship of activity of HPA axis and synaptic degeneration in humans are limited. Methods: We compared CSF cortisol levels in 310 subjects, including 92 cognitively normal older people, 149 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 69 patients with mild AD. Several linear and logistic regression models were conducted to investigate associations between CSF cortisol and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25, reflecting synaptic degeneration) and other AD-related biomarkers. Results: We found that levels of cortisol in CSF were associated with SNAP-25 levels and tau pathologies but not amyloid-Î² protein. However, there were no significant differences in CSF cortisol levels among the three diagnostic groups. Conclusion: The HPA axis may play a crucial role in synaptic degeneration in AD pathogenesis."

Motor cortex is also engaged when actions are observed or imagined, but the manner in which ensembles of neurons represent these volitional states (VoSs) is unknown. Here we provide direct demonstration that observing, imagining or attempting action activates shared neural ensembles in human motor cortex. Two individuals with tetraplegia (due to brainstem stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS) were verbally instructed to watch, imagine, or attempt reaching actions displayed on a computer screen. Neural activity in the precentral gyrus incorporated information about both cognitive state and movement kinematics; the three conditions presented overlapping but unique, statistically distinct activity patterns. These findings demonstrate that individual neurons in human motor cortex reflect information related to sensory inputs and VoS in addition to movement features, and are a key part of a broader network linking perception and cognition to action.",Artificial Immune System-Negative Selection Classification Algorithm (NSCA) for Four Class Electroencephalogram (EEG) Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524257,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Artificial immune systems (AIS) are intelligent algorithms derived from the principles inspired by the human immune system. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) signals for four distinct motor movements of human limbs are detected and classified using a negative selection classification algorithm (NSCA). For this study, a widely studied open source EEG signal database (BCI IV-Graz dataset 2a, comprising nine subjects) has been used. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are extracted as selected features from recorded EEG signals. Dimensionality reduction of data is carried out by applying two hidden layered stacked auto-encoder. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimized detectors (artificial lymphocytes) are trained using negative selection algorithm (NSA) for detection and classification of four motor movements. The trained detectors consist of four sets of detectors, each set is trained for detection and classification of one of the four movements from the other three movements. The optimized radius of detector is small enough not to mis-detect the sample. Euclidean distance of each detector with every training dataset sample is taken and compared with the optimized radius of the detector as a nonself detector. Our proposed approach achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.39% for limb movements over nine subjects with a maximum individual subject classification accuracy of 97.5% for subject number eight.",Effect of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Training on the Finger Extensor Muscles for the Contralateral Corticospinal Tract in Normal Subjects: A Diffusion Tensor Tractography Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524256,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Objectives: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a popular rehabilitative modality to improve motor function of the extremities and trunk. In this study, we investigated changes of hand function and the contralateral corticospinal tract (CST) with treatment by NMES on the finger extensor muscles for 2 weeks, using serial diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Methods: Thirteen right handed normal subjects were recruited. Treatment was applied to the left hand (the NMES side), and the right hand was the control side. NMES was applied for 30 min/day, 7 days per week, for 2 weeks. Hand motor function was evaluated twice at pre-NMES and post-NMES training using grip strength (GS), Purdue pegboard test (PPT) and tip pinch. The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and tract volume (TV) of the CST in both hemispheres were measured using DTT. Results: On the control side, the clinical scores did not differ significantly between pre- and post-NMES training (p > 0.05). However, on the NMES side, PPT and tip pinch improved significantly (p < 0.05), although GS did not. TV of the right CST increased significantly at post-NMES training (p < 0.05) whereas FA and MD did not differ significantly (p > 0.05). By contrast, FA, MD and TV on the left CST did not change significantly (p > 0.05). Conclusion: We demonstrated facilitation of the contralateral CST with improvement of fine motor activity by 2 weeks of NMES training of peripheral muscles in normal subjects. We think our results can be applied to the normal subjects and patients with brain injury to improve the fine motor function of the hand and facilitate the normal CST or healing of the injured CST.",Synaptic Connectivity in Medium Spiny Neurons of the Nucleus Accumbens: A Sex-Dependent Mechanism Underlying Apathy in the HIV-1 Transgenic Rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524255,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction is commonly associated with apathy, a neuropsychiatric sequelae of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Behavioral and neurochemical indices of apathy in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in frontal-subcortical circuitry, are influenced by the factor of biological sex. Despite evidence of sex differences in HIV-1, the effect of biological sex on medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are central integrators of frontal-subcortical input, has not been systematically evaluated. In the present study, a DiOlistic labeling technique was used to investigate the role of long-term HIV-1 viral protein exposure, the factor of biological sex, and their possible interaction, on synaptic dysfunction in MSNs of the NAc in the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat. HIV-1 Tg rats, independent of biological sex, displayed profound alterations in synaptic connectivity, evidenced by a prominent shift in the distribution of dendritic spines. Female HIV-1 Tg rats, but not male HIV-1 Tg rats, exhibited alterations in dendritic branching and neuronal arbor complexity relative to control animals, supporting an alteration in glutamate neurotransmission. Morphologically, HIV-1 Tg male, but not female HIV-1 Tg rats, displayed a population shift towards decreased dendritic spine volume, suggesting decreased synaptic area, relative to control animals. Synaptic dysfunction accurately identified presence of the HIV-1 transgene, dependent upon biological sex, with at least 80% accuracy (i.e., Male: 80%; Female: 90%). Collectively, these results support a primary alteration in circuit connectivity, the mechanism of which is dependent upon biological sex. Understanding the effect of biological sex on the underlying neural mechanism for HIV-1 associated apathy is vital for the development of sex-based therapeutics and cure strategies.",Neural Basis of Action Observation and Understanding From First- and Third-Person Perspectives: An fMRI Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524253,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Understanding the intentions of others while observing their actions is a fundamental aspect of social behavior. However, the differences in neural and functional mechanisms between observing actions from the first-person perspective (1PP) and third-person perspective (3PP) are poorly understood. The present study had two aims: (1) to delineate the neural basis of action observation and understanding from the 1PP and 3PP; and (2) to identify whether there are different activation patterns during action observation and understanding from 1PP and 3PP. We used a blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental design. Twenty-six right-handed participants observed interactions between the right hand and a cup from 1PP and 3PP. The results indicated that both 1PP and 3PP were associated with similar patterns of activation in key areas of the mirror neuron system underlying action observation and understanding. Importantly, besides of the core network of mirror neuron system, we also found that parts of the basal ganglia and limbic system were involved in action observation in both the 1PP and 3PP tasks, including the putamen, insula and hippocampus, providing a more complete understanding of the neural basis for action observation and understanding. Moreover, compared with the 3PP, the 1PP task caused more extensive and stronger activation. In contrast, the opposite comparison revealed that no regions exhibited significantly more activation in the 3PP compared with the 1PP condition. The current results have important implications for understanding the role of the core network underlying the mirror neuron system, as well as parts of the basal ganglia and limbic system, during action observation and understanding.","Sexually-Relevant Visual and Chemosensory Signals Induce Distinct Behaviors and Neural Activation Patterns in the Social African Cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524252,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Across vertebrates, the use of multimodal (multiple sensory modalities) signals has evolved to convey important information to receivers. Information content of multimodal signals can be the same as or different from information in each unimodal signal, and are classified as redundant or non-redundant, respectively, based on receivers' behavioral responses. Despite the prevalence and importance of multimodal signaling across taxa, relatively little is known about how and where these signals are processed in the brains of receivers. We used the social African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, to investigate how sexually-relevant visual and chemosensory uni- and multimodal signals from gravid (full of eggs) females influence behavior, brain activation patterns, and physiology in dominant males. We presented both visual and chemosensory signals either alone or together and found that males need sexually-relevant visual signals to engage in stereotypical courtship behaviors such as body quivers, waggles, and leads into spawning territories. However, the number of courtship behaviors was greater when males were exposed to multimodal visual-chemosensory signals, compared to either unimodal signal alone. When a female visual signal was absent, males increased swimming and overall activity in response to female-conditioned water compared to control water, suggesting that female-released chemosensory signals may stimulate male searching behavior and motivation. Importantly, we also tested anosmic (olfactory ablated) males to demonstrate that this behavior is primarily mediated by the olfactory system rather than gustation. Using the immediate early gene cfos as a proxy for neural activation, we also demonstrate differential activation in social and olfactory-relevant brain regions of dominant males exposed to unimodal and multimodal visual-chemosensory signals. We found at least one region that is preferentially activated by reception of signals from each sense, as well as regions that exhibit an additive effect on activation with multimodal visual-chemosensory stimulation. These data provide insight on how multimodal signals are processed in the brain and integrated with internal physiology of receivers to produce social behaviors, and lay the groundwork for future studies on the evolution of sensory perception.",Deficits in Behavioral Functions of Intact Barrel Cortex Following Lesions of Homotopic Contralateral Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524251,Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Focal unilateral injuries to the somatosensory whisker barrel cortex have been shown cause long-lasting deficits in the activity and experience-dependent plasticity of neurons in the intact contralateral barrel cortex. However, the long-term effect of these deficits on behavioral functions of the intact contralesional cortex is not clear. In this study, we used the ""Gap-crossing task"" a barrel cortex-dependent, whisker-sensitive, tactile behavior to test the hypothesis that unilateral lesions of the somatosensory cortex would affect behavioral functions of the intact somatosensory cortex and degrade the execution of a bilaterally learnt behavior. Adult rats were trained to perform the Gap-crossing task using whiskers on both sides of the face. The barrel cortex was then lesioned unilaterally by subpial aspiration. As observed in other studies, when rats used whiskers that directly projected to the lesioned hemisphere the performance of Gap-crossing was drastically compromised, perhaps due to direct effect of lesion. Significant and persistent deficits were present when the lesioned rats performed Gap-crossing task using whiskers that projected to the intact cortex. The deficits were specific to performance of the task at the highest levels of sensitivity. Comparable deficits were seen when normal, bilaterally trained, rats performed the Gap-crossing task with only the whiskers on one side of the face or when they used only two rows of whiskers (D row and E row) intact on both side of the face. These findings indicate that the prolonged impairment in execution of the learnt task by rats with unilateral lesions of somatosensory cortex could be because sensory inputs from one set of whiskers to the intact cortex is insufficient to provide adequate sensory information at higher thresholds of detection. Our data suggest that optimal performance of somatosensory behavior requires dynamic activity-driven interhemispheric interactions from the entire somatosensory inputs between homotopic areas of the cerebral cortex. These results imply that focal unilateral cortical injuries, including those in humans, are likely to have widespread bilateral effects on information processing including in intact areas of the cortex.",A Pipeline for Volume Electron Microscopy of the Caenorhabditis elegans Nervous System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524248,Frontiers in neural circuits,2019 04 05,"The ""connectome,"" a comprehensive wiring diagram of synaptic connectivity, is achieved through volume electron microscopy (vEM) analysis of an entire nervous system and all associated non-neuronal tissues.

Recent advances in vEM allow mapping new C. elegans connectomes with increased throughput, and reduced subjectivity. Current vEM studies aim to not only fill the remaining gaps in the original connectome, but also address fundamental questions including how the connectome changes during development, the nature of individuality, sexual dimorphism, and how genetic and environmental factors regulate connectivity. Here we describe our current vEM pipeline and projected improvements for the study of the C. elegans nervous system and beyond.",Vestibular System and Self-Motion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524247,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Detection of the state of self-motion, such as the instantaneous heading direction, the traveled trajectory and traveled distance or time, is critical for efficient spatial navigation. Numerous psychophysical studies have indicated that the vestibular system, originating from the otolith and semicircular canals in our inner ears, provides robust signals for different aspects of self-motion perception. In addition, vestibular signals interact with other sensory signals such as visual optic flow to facilitate natural navigation. These behavioral results are consistent with recent findings in neurophysiological studies. In particular, vestibular activity in response to the translation or rotation of the head/body in darkness is revealed in a growing number of cortical regions, many of which are also sensitive to visual motion stimuli. The temporal dynamics of the vestibular activity in the central nervous system can vary widely, ranging from acceleration-dominant to velocity-dominant. Different temporal dynamic signals may be decoded by higher level areas for different functions. For example, the acceleration signals during the translation of body in the horizontal plane may be used by the brain to estimate the heading directions. Although translation and rotation signals arise from independent peripheral organs, that is, otolith and canals, respectively, they frequently converge onto single neurons in the central nervous system including both the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. The convergent neurons typically exhibit stronger responses during a combined curved motion trajectory which may serve as the neural correlate for complex path perception. During spatial navigation, traveled distance or time may be encoded by different population of neurons in multiple regions including hippocampal-entorhinal system, posterior parietal cortex, or frontal cortex.",Expression of DCX and Transcription Factor Profiling in Photothrombosis-Induced Focal Ischemia in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524246,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Adult neurogenesis is present in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone in mammalian brain under physiological conditions. Recently, adult neurogenesis has also been reported in other brain regions after brain injury. In this study, we established a focal striatal ischemic model in adult mice via photothrombosis (PT) and investigated how focal ischemia elicits neurogenesis in the striatum. We found that astrocytes and microglia increased in early post-ischemic stage, followed by a 1-week late-onset of doublecortin (DCX) expression in the striatum. The number of DCX-positive neurons reached the peak level at day 7, but they were still observed at day 28 post-ischemia. Moreover, Rbp-J (a key effector of Notch signaling) deletion in astrocytes has been reported to promote the neuron regeneration after brain ischemia, and we provided the change of gene expression profile in the striatum of astrocyte-specific Rbp-J knockout (KO) mice glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-CreER:Rbp-Jfl/fl), which may help to clarify detailed potential mechanisms for the post-ischemic neurogenesis in the striatum."

The aim of the present study was to further investigate the underlying mechanisms and whether it could act as a fast-onset antidepressant. In the current study, depressive-like behavior was induced in rats by a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model and assessed with the Sucrose Preference Test (SPT). Treatment with YL-0919 (2.5 mg/kg, i.g.), but not with fluoxetine (Flx; 10 mg/kg, i.g.), caused a fast improvement in the SPT scores. In CUS-exposed rats, YL-0919 treatment for 5 days decreased the immobility time in a forced swimming test (FST), and a 10-day treatment decreased the latency to feed in a Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test (NSFT). In addition to the behavioral tests, the effects of YL-0919 on synaptic protein expression were also evaluated. Western blotting showed that YL-0919 significantly enhanced the expression levels of synaptic proteins such as synapsin I, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), phosphorylated mammalian targeting of rapamycin (pmTOR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. To determine how the mTOR signaling is involved in the fast-onset antidepressant-like effects of YL-0919, the mTOR-specific inhibitor rapamycin was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) together with the YL-0919 treatment. The observed changes in behavioral tests and protein expression could be reversed by rapamycin treatment. This suggests that the fast-onset antidepressant effects of YL-0919 were partially caused by changes in synaptogenesis mediated by activation of mTOR pathways. Our data suggest that YL-0919 may be a powerful/effective antidepressant with fast-onset.",Lithium Treatment Is Safe in Children With Intellectual Disability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524233,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Lithium is a widely used and effective treatment for individuals with psycho-neurological disorders, and it exhibits protective and regenerative properties in multiple brain injury animal models, but the clinical experience in young children is limited due to potential toxicity. As an interim analysis, this paper reports the safety/tolerability profiles of low-dose lithium treatment in children with intellectual disability (ID) and its possible beneficial effects. In a randomized, single-center clinical trial, 124 children with ID were given either oral lithium carbonate 6 mg/kg twice per day or the same dose of calcium carbonate as a placebo (n = 62/group) for 3 months. The safety of low-dose lithium treatment in children, and all the adverse events were monitored. The effects of low-dose lithium on cognition was evaluated by intelligence quotient (IQ), adaptive capacity was assessed by the Infant-Junior Middle School Students Social-Life Abilities Scale (IJMSSSLAS), and overall performance was evaluated according to the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. After 3 months of lithium treatment, 13/61 children (21.3%) presented with mild side effects, including 4 (6.6%) with gastrointestinal symptoms, 4 (6.6%) with neurological symptoms, 2 (3.3%) with polyuria, and 3 (4.9%) with other symptoms-one with hyperhidrosis, one with alopecia, and one with drooling. Four children in the lithium group had elevated blood thyroid stimulating hormone, which normalized spontaneously after lithium discontinuation. Both IQ and IJMSSSAS scores increased following 3 months of lithium treatment (F = 11.03, p = 0.002 and F = 7.80, p = 0.007, respectively), but such increases were not seen in the placebo group. CGI-I scores in the lithium group were 1.25 points lower (better) than in the placebo group (F = 82.66, p < 0.001) after 3 months of treatment. In summary, lithium treatment for 3 months had only mild and reversible side effects and had positive effects on cognition and overall performance in children with ID.

These normal developmental changes in AMPARs are particularly vulnerable to risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), which include loss or mutations of synaptic proteins and environmental insults, such as dietary zinc deficiency. Here, we show how Shank2 and Shank3 mediate a zinc-dependent regulation of AMPAR function and subunit switch from GluA2-lacking to GluA2-containing AMPARs. Over development, we found a concomitant increase in Shank2 and Shank3 with GluA2 at synapses, implicating these molecules as potential players in AMPAR maturation. Since Shank activation and function require zinc, we next studied whether neuronal activity regulated postsynaptic zinc at glutamatergic synapses. Zinc was found to increase transiently and reversibly with neuronal depolarization at synapses, which could affect Shank and AMPAR localization and activity. Elevated zinc induced multiple functional changes in AMPAR, indicative of a subunit switch. Specifically, zinc lengthened the decay time of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents and reduced their inward rectification in young hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, both Shank2 and Shank3 were necessary for the zinc-sensitive enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and act in concert to promote removal of GluA1 while enhancing recruitment of GluA2 at pre-existing Shank puncta. These findings highlight a cooperative local dynamic regulation of AMPAR subunit switch controlled by zinc signaling through Shank2 and Shank3 to shape the biophysical properties of developing glutamatergic synapses. Given the zinc sensitivity of young neurons and its dependence on Shank2 and Shank3, genetic mutations and/or environmental insults during early development could impair synaptic maturation and circuit formation that underlie ASD etiology.",Simulation Study of Intermittent Axonal Block and Desynchronization Effect Induced by High-Frequency Stimulation of Electrical Pulses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524231,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully used in treating neural disorders in brain, such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. However, the precise mechanisms of DBS remain unclear. Regular DBS therapy utilizes high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of electrical pulses. Among all of neuronal elements, axons are mostly inclined to be activated by electrical pulses. Therefore, the response of axons may play an important role in DBS treatment. To study the axonal responses during HFS, we developed a computational model of myelinated axon to simulate sequences of action potentials generated in single and multiple axons (an axon bundle) by stimulations. The stimulations are applied extracellularly by a point source of current pulses with a frequency of 50-200 Hz. Additionally, our model takes into account the accumulation of potassium ions in the peri-axonal spaces. Results show that the increase of extracellular potassium generates intermittent depolarization block in the axons during HFS. Under the state of alternate block and recovery, axons fire action potentials at a rate far lower than the frequency of stimulation pulses. In addition, the degree of axonal block is highly related to the distance between the axons and the stimulation point. The differences in the degree of block for individual axons in a bundle result in desynchronized firing among the axons. Stimulations with higher frequency and/or greater intensity can induce axonal block faster and increase the desynchronization effect on axonal firing. Presumably, the desynchronized axonal activity induced by HFS could generate asynchronous activity in the population of target neurons downstream thereby suppressing over-synchronized firing of neurons in pathological conditions. The desynchronization effect generated by intermittent activation of axons may be crucial for DBS therapy. The present study provides new insights into the mechanisms of DBS, which is significant for advancing the application of DBS.",Low Cost Interconnected Architecture for the Hardware Spiking Neural Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524230,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"A novel low cost interconnected architecture (LCIA) is proposed in this paper, which is an efficient solution for the neuron interconnections for the hardware spiking neural networks (SNNs). It is based on an all-to-all connection that takes each paired input and output nodes of multi-layer SNNs as the source and destination of connections. The aim is to maintain an efficient routing performance under low hardware overhead. A Networks-on-Chip (NoC) router is proposed as the fundamental component of the LCIA, where an effective scheduler is designed to address the traffic challenge due to irregular spikes. The router can find requests rapidly, make the arbitration decision promptly, and provide equal services to different network traffic requests. Experimental results show that the LCIA can manage the intercommunication of the multi-layer neural networks efficiently and have a low hardware overhead which can maintain the scalability of hardware SNNs.",Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis by Non-coding RNAs: Implications for Substance Use Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524229,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 11,"The discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)has been one of the central findings from early genomic sequencing studies. Not only was the presence of these genes unknown previously, it was the staggering disproportionate share of the genome that was predicted to be encoded by ncRNAs that was truly significant in genomic research. Over the years the function of various classes of these ncRNAs has been revealed. One of the first and enduring regulatory programs associated with these factors was development. In the neurosciences, the discovery of adult derived populations of dividing cells within the brain was equally substantial. The brain was hypothesized to be plastic only in its neuronal connectivity, but the discovery of the generation of new neurons was a novel mechanism of neuronal and behavioral plasticity. The process of adult neurogenesis resembles early neuronal development and has been found to share many parallels in the proper stages of specified genetic programs. Adult neurogenesis has also been found to play a role in learning and memory involved in particular hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Substance use disorders (SUDs) are an example of a behavioral condition that is associated with and possibly driven by hippocampal alterations. Our laboratory has determined that hippocampal adult neurogenesis is necessary for a rodent model of methamphetamine relapse. Due to the previous research on ncRNAs in development and in other brain regions involved in SUDs, we posit that ncRNAs may play a role in adult neurogenesis associated with this disorder. This review will cover the regulatory mechanisms of various classes of ncRNAs on the coordinated genetic program associated with adult neurogenesis with a special focus on how these programs could be dysregulated in SUDs.",Hypothalamic Microglial Activation in Obesity: A Mini-Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524228,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 05 08,"Emerging data demonstrate that microglia activation plays a pivotal role in the development of hypothalamic inflammation in obesity. Early after the introduction of a high-fat diet, hypothalamic microglia undergo morphological, and functional changes in response to excessive dietary saturated fats. Initially the resident microglia are affected; however, as diet-induced obesity persists, bone marrow-derived myeloid cells gradually replace resident microglia. Genetic and pharmacological approaches aimed at dampening the inflammatory activity in the hypothalamus of experimental models of obesity have proven beneficial to correct the obese phenotype and improve metabolic abnormalities commonly associated with obesity. These approaches provide an experimental proof-of-concept that hypothalamic inflammation is central to the pathophysiology of obesity; understanding the details of the roles played by microglia in this process may help the development of preventive and therapeutic advances in the field. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms underlying hypothalamic microglial activation in high-fat induced obesity.",Exosomes Derived From miR-133b-Modified Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promote Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524227,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been found in injured spinal cords after spinal cord injury (SCI). Previous studies have shown that miR-133b plays an important role in the differentiation of neurons and the outgrowth of neurites. Recently, exosomes have been used as novel biological vehicles to transfer miRNAs locally or systemically, but little is known about the effect of the delivery of exosome-mediated miRNAs on the treatment of SCI. In the present study, we observed that mesenchymal stem cells, the most common cell types known to produce exosomes, could package miR-133b into secreted exosomes. After SCI, tail vein injection of miR-133b exosomes into rats significantly improved the recovery of hindlimb function when compared to control groups. Additionally, treatment with miR-133b exosomes reduced the volume of the lesion, preserved neuronal cells, and promoted the regeneration of axons after SCI. We next observed that the expression of RhoA, a direct target of miR-133b, was decreased in the miR-133b exosome group. Moreover, we showed that miR-133b exosomes activated ERK1/2, STAT3, and CREB, which are signaling pathway proteins involved in the survival of neurons and the regeneration of axons. In summary, these findings demonstrated that systemically injecting miR-133b exosomes preserved neurons, promoted the regeneration of axons, and improved the recovery of hindlimb locomotor function following SCI, suggesting that the transfer of exosome-mediated miRNAs represents a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of SCI.",The Temporal Dynamic Relationship Between Attention and Crowding: Electrophysiological Evidence From an Event-Related Potential Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524226,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Visual crowding is the difficulty experienced in identifying a target flanked by other objects within the peripheral visual field. Despite extensive research conducted on this topic, the precise relationship between attention and crowding is still debatable. One perspective suggests that crowding is a bottom-up and pre-attentive process, while another suggests that crowding is top-down and attentional. A third perspective proposes that crowding is a combination of bottom-up and top-down processes. To address this debate, the current study manipulated the attention and distance between targets and flankers, while simultaneously measuring event-related potentials, in human participants. Results indicated that, compared to uncrowded targets, crowded targets elicited more negative frontal N1 and P2 activity and a less negative occipital N1 activity, regardless of whether targets were attended or unattended, and a more positive occipital P2 activity when they were attended. Furthermore, the crowded minus uncrowded difference amplitude was more negative over the frontal region and more positive over the occipital region when the targets were attended, compared to when they were unattended during the N1 and P2 stages. This suggests that crowding, a concept that originates from Gestalt grouping, occurs automatically and can be modulated by attention.","Phoenixin Expression Is Regulated by the Fatty Acids Palmitate, Docosahexaenoic Acid and Oleate, and the Endocrine Disrupting Chemical Bisphenol A in Immortalized Hypothalamic Neurons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524225,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Phoenixin (PNX) is a newly identified reproductive peptide required for the estrous cycle. It is most highly expressed in the hypothalamus, where it is a positive regulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and kisspeptin. However, it is unknown what signals lie upstream of Pnx to coordinate its effects on GnRH and kisspeptin. We investigated the effects of the hormones, estrogen and leptin; the fatty acids, palmitate, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), oleate and palmitoleate; and the endocrine disrupting chemical BPA on Pnx mRNA levels. We also examined whether the signaling pathways of nitric oxide, lipopolysaccharide, cAMP and protein kinase C could alter Pnx expression. Immortalized hypothalamic neurons were treated from 2 to 24 h with these compounds and Pnx mRNA levels were measured with RT-qPCR. Unexpectedly, only BPA as well as the fatty acids, palmitate, DHA and oleate, could alter Pnx expression; therefore suggesting that Pnx may fulfill a nutrient-sensing role in the hypothalamus. Our study is the first to delineate potential regulators of this novel neuropeptide, and our findings provide some insight into the functional role of PNX in the hypothalamus."

This is true of the building and construction industry as well. At a strategic level, environmental issues have received more attention with the establishment of roles such as environmental managers and implementation of advanced environmental management systems. However, adoption has been slow in the absence of a holistic approach to environmental challenges, partly reinforced by a perception that giving more than the legally required level of environmental consideration will only add to costs without corresponding financial benefits. This raises the following question that the study aims to answer: What is the most important factor influencing decision makers' in adopting environmental considerations? To this end, it analysed questionnaire data collected from decision makers in the Swedish construction industry along with an in-depth case study of a specific building and construction company. The results show that decision makers perceive informational and institutional constraints on the adoption of environmental considerations. Lack of information is perceived as the biggest obstacle to environmental considerations. If information and knowledge about clients' and end users' financial benefits from adopting environmental considerations need to be exploited, they have to be supported by contractual forms that discard a short-term focus on the investment costs of a building in favour of a focus on long-term operational and maintenance costs and benefits.","Vacancy in shrinking downtowns: a comparative study of QuÃ©bec, Ontario, and New England.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524211,Journal of housing and the built environment : HBE,2018 12 17,"In North America and around the globe, there has been emerging recognition of the size and scope of urban shrinkage, yet little is understood about how decline impacts commercial centers and downtowns.

We seek to test the hypothesis that differences in the process of urban decline in downtown districts vary due to national or historic context. Using statistical analysis and direct observations, we found that while the scale of population decline was greatest in New England, downtowns in both Ontario and QuÃ©bec have seen substantial decline and have appeared to have better weathered the change with respect to physical signs of decline.","Influence of Intimate Terrorism, Situational Couple Violence, and Mutual Violent Control on Male Victims.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524210,Psychology of men & masculinity,2018 12 17,"The goal of the current study is to test - among samples of men - some previous findings relative to Johnson's (2008) typology of partner violence (PV). Among samples of exclusively women, Johnson has found that the frequency and severity of PV - and victims' mental health - are worse for female victims of intimate terrorism (IT) than of situational couple violence (SCV). However, such findings have rarely been tested in male victims of PV. Furthermore, although Johnson posits that mutual violent control (MVC) is relatively rare, other research suggests that it is about as common as IT and may be associated with worse PV and health. We examined the relative frequency and severity of various forms of PV, and the relative health and mental health between men who (a) experienced IT versus SCV, and (b) experienced IT versus MVC. Our two samples were 611 men who sought help for PV victimization and 1,601 men from a population-based sample. Our analyses showed that across samples, men who were victims of IT had significantly worse mental health than men who experienced SCV, and IT victims experienced more severe and frequent PV, including physical, sexual, and non-physical forms of PV. Male victims of IT had worse mental and physical health than either men who perpetrated IT or experienced MVC, but men involved in MVC were involved in relationships with more types of PV than either male IT perpetrators or victims.

Thus, it is important to identify factors that might impact their mental health recovery, such as low adherence to their treatment regimen. Although many studies have examined the issue of psychiatric medication nonadherence, very few studies have focused specifically on justice-involved individuals. The strength of the clinician/patient working alliance has been found to be significantly associated with psychiatric medication adherence in prior research, but this relationship has not been assessed in a parolee population. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if patient-rated working alliance was a significant predictor of low psychiatric medication adherence while taking into account alcohol/illegal drug use, age, and ethnicity in a sample of recently released parolees with mental illness (N=49). Patient-rated working alliance, age, and ethnicity were not significant predictors of low adherence. Alcohol/illegal drug use during the follow-up period was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of meeting the criteria for low medication adherence (OR=8.36; 95% CI=1.60, 43.66).

The GAFG can, in turn, be used for developing groundwater screening levels for VI given target indoor air quality screening levels. In this study, we examine the validity and applicability of the GAFG both for predicting indoor air impacts and for determining groundwater screening levels. This is done using both analysis of published data and screening model calculations. Among the 774 total paired groundwater-indoor air measurements in the USEPA's VI database (which were used by that agency to generate the GAFG) we found that there are 427 pairs for which a single groundwater measurement or interpolated value was applied to multiple buildings. In one case, up to 73 buildings were associated with a single interpolated groundwater value and in another case up to 15 buildings were associated with a single groundwater measurement (i.e, that the indoor air contaminant concentrations in all of the associated buildings were influenced by the concentration determined at a single point). In more than 70% of the cases (390 of 536 paired measurements in which horizontal building-monitoring well distance was recorded) the monitoring wells were located more than 30 meters (and some up to over 200 meters) from the associated buildings. In a few cases, the measurements in the database even improbably implied that soil gas contaminant concentrations increased, rather than decreased, in an upward direction from a contaminant source to a foundation slab. Such observations indicate problematic source characterization within the dataset used to generate the GAFG, and some indicate the possibility of a significant influence of a preferential contaminant pathway. While the inherent value of the USEPA database itself is not being questioned here, the above facts raise the very real possibility that the recommended groundwater attenuation factors are being influenced by variables or conditions that have not thus far been fully accounted for. In addition, the predicted groundwater attenuation factors often fall far beyond the upper limits of predictions from mathematical models of VI, ranging from screening models to detailed computational fluid dynamic models. All these models are based on the same fundamental conceptual site model, involving a vadose zone vapor transport pathway starting at an underlying uniform groundwater source and leading to the foundation of a building of concern. According to the analysis presented here, we believe that for scenarios for which such a ""traditional"" VI pathway is appropriate, 10-4 is a more appropriately conservative generic groundwater to indoor air attenuation factor than is the EPA-recommended 10-3. This is based both on the statistical analysis of USEPA's VI database, as well as the traditional mathematical models of VI. This result has been validated by comparison with results from some well documented field studies."

This paper provides a novel assessment of the emerging approach of developing indices to identify social isolation. It provides an overview of a selection of indices being developed by local authorities across England; considers the validity of such quantitative indices; and explores the extent to which more in-depth qualitative data collected at a neighbourhood level is additionally required. It draws on evidence of a social isolation index for older people created by a northern English local authority, assessing its validity through a qualitative sense check; an innovative approach which has not been attempted elsewhere. The paper contributes important knowledge to the growing literature in this field by further developing understanding around the most effective ways of identifying, measuring, and understanding social isolation at a local level. Our findings indicate that an index, alone, is insufficient to fully capture the multifaceted nature of social isolation as relevant indicators, unique to local spaces, which cannot easily be measured quantitatively, are often excluded. The paper offers a significant and original contribution to the debate for both academics who wish to gain a greater understanding of the role indices can play in identifying those most at risk of social isolation, as well as for policy makers and practitioners who are currently grappling with this challenging concept.",Phosphino-Triazole Ligands for Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524158,Organometallics,2018 12 17,"Twelve 1,5-disubtituted and fourteen 5-substituted 1,2,3-triazole derivatives bearing diaryl or dialkyl phosphines at the 5-position were synthesized and used as ligands for palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions.

The online tool SambVca2.0 was used to assess steric parameters of ligands and preliminary buried volume determination using XRD-obtained data in a small number of cases proved to be informative. Two modeling approaches were compared for the determination of the buried volume of ligands where XRD data was not available. An approach with imposed steric restrictions was found to be superior in leading to buried volume determinations that closely correlate with observed reaction conversions. The online tool LLAMA was used to determine lead-likeness of potential Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling products, from which 10 of the most lead-like were successfully synthesized.

Following the world society tradition of organizational institutionalism, this paper probes the potential limits of the spread of such rationalized concepts among different types of research funders. Our comparative approach is particularly designed to study the role and position of nonprofit research funders (NPF), a comparison that is relevant as NPF could potentially be shielded from such rationalized pressures given their lack of profit gaining motives. By making a qualitative interview-based investigation we are able to describe how research funders rationalize their contributions to society at large, as well as their obligations to the researchers they fund. Four types of research funders are compared-independently wealthy philanthropists, fundraising dependent nonprofits, public agencies, and industry. We find that NPF, and especially philanthropists, are the least commercially geared type of funder, but that philanthropists also express least obligations to researchers funded. This is in sharp contrast to public research funders who, even more than industry, employ commercially geared rationalizations. We also find that both public and corporate funders express obligations to the researchers they fund. Our results indicate that there are limits to the spread of commercially tinted rationalizations among NPF, but that this does not necessarily mean an increased sense of obligations to the researchers funded, and by extension to the integrity of scientific pursuit.",Alternating Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (AROMP) of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Monomers Provides Oligomers with Side-Chain Sequence Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524145,Macromolecules,2019 05 15,"We report the formation of oligomers with side-chain sequence control using ruthenium-catalyzed alternating ring-opening metathesis polymerization (AROMP).

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 01 09,"The charge transport through GaAs nanowires, partially p-doped and partially intrinsic, is analyzed by four-point resistance profiling along freestanding nanowires using a multip-STM. The charge transport channel in the undoped segment is assigned to the surface conductivity, while the interior of the nanowire is the conductance channel in the p-doped segment. The convoluted interplay between conduction through the interior of the nanowire and surface state conduction is studied in detail. Measurements of the I-V curves along the nanowires provide the experimental basis for the proposed charge transport model for the transition of the conduction from the interior to the surface of the nanowire. A voltage drop along the surface state conduction channel leads to an upward shift of the band edges at the surface. This results, for higher applied voltages, in the removal of the depletion layer and an opening of a conductance channel between the interior of the nanowire and the surface states.","Atomic ordering, magnetic properties, and electronic structure of Mn2CoGa Heusler alloy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524115,Journal of physics.

In this context, a program devoted to perform in vivo phase-contrast synchrotron radiation breast computed tomography is ongoing at the Elettra facility (Trieste, Italy). The used phase-contrast technique is the propagation-based configuration, which requires a spatially coherent source and a sufficient object-to-detector distance. In this work the effect of this distance on image quality is quantitatively investigated scanning a large breast surgical specimen at three object-to-detector distances (1.6, 3, 9 m) and comparing the images both before and after applying the phase-retrieval procedure. The sample is imaged at 30 keV with a [Formula: see text] pixel pitch CdTe single-photon-counting detector, positioned at a fixed distance of 31.6 m from the source. The detector fluence is kept constant for all acquisitions. The study shows that, at the largest distance, a 20-fold SNR increase can be obtained by applying the phase-retrieval procedure. Moreover, it is shown that, for phase-retrieved images, changing the object-to-detector distance does not affect spatial resolution while boosting SNR (four-fold increase going from the shortest to the largest distance). The experimental results are supported by a theoretical model proposed by other authors, whose salient results are presented in this paper.",Observation of dynamic charge stripes in Tm0.19Yb0.81B12 at the metal-insulator transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524111,Journal of physics.

It is suggested that cooperative Jahn-Teller effect in the boron sublattice is a cause of the large-amplitude rattling modes of the Tm and Yb ions responsible for the 'modulation' of the conduction band along one of the [Formula: see text] directions through the variation of 5d-2p hybridization of electron states.,Homogeneous hydroxyapatite/alginate composite hydrogel promotes calcified cartilage matrix deposition with potential for three-dimensional bioprinting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524110,Biofabrication,2019 02 13,"Calcified cartilage regeneration plays an important role in successful osteochondral repair, since it provides a biological and mechanical transition from the unmineralized cartilage at the articulating surface to the underlying mineralized bone. To biomimic native calcified cartilage in engineered constructs, here we test the hypothesis that hydroxyapatite (HAP) stimulates chondrocytes to secrete the characteristic matrix of calcified cartilage. Sodium citrate (SC) was added as a dispersant of HAP within alginate (ALG), and homogeneous dispersal of HAP within ALG hydrogel was confirmed using sedimentation tests, electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. To examine the biological performance of ALG/HAP composites, chondrocyte survival and proliferation, extracellular matrix production, and mineralization potential were evaluated in the presence or absence of the HAP phase. Chondrocytes in ALG/HAP constructs survived well and proliferated, but also expressed higher levels of calcified cartilage markers compared to controls, including Collagen type X secretion, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mineral deposition. Compared to controls, ALG/HAP constructs also showed an elevated level of mineralized matrix in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in mice. The printability of ALG/HAP composite hydrogel precursors was verified by 3D printing of ALG/HAP hydrogel scaffolds with a porous structure. In summary, these results confirm the hypothesis that HAP in ALG hydrogel stimulates chondrocytes to secrete calcified matrix in vitro and in vivo and reveal that ALG/HAP composites have the potential for 3D bioprinting and osteochondral regeneration.",Tracking feature-based attention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524109,Journal of neural engineering,2019 01 14,"Feature-based attention (FBA) helps one detect objects with a particular color, motion, or orientation.

This global property of FBA lets one use stimuli presented in the peripheral visual field to track attention in a task presented centrally. The present study explores the use of SSVEPs, generated by flicker presented peripherally, to track attention in a visual search task presented centrally. We evaluate whether this use of EEG to track FBA is robust enough to track attention when performing visual search within a dynamic 3D environment presented with a head-mounted display (HMD).",Phonon thermal conduction in a graphene-C3N heterobilayer using molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524108,Nanotechnology,2018 12 26,"Two-dimensional (2D) graphene (GRA) and polyaniline (C3N) monolayers are attracting growing research interest due to their excellent electrical and thermal properties. In this work, in-plane and out-of-plane phonon thermal conduction of GRA-C3N heterobilayer are systematically investigated by using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Effects of system size, temperature and interlayer coupling strength on the in-plane thermal conductivity (k) and out-of-plane interfacial thermal resistance (R) are evaluated. Firstly, a monotonic increasing trend of k with increasing system size is observed, while a negative correlation between thermal conductivity and temperature is revealed. The interlayer coupling strength is found to have a weak effect on the in-plane thermal conductivity of the heterobilayer. Secondly, at TÂ =Â 300 K and ÏÂ =Â 1, the predicted R of GRAÂ âÂ C3N and C3NÂ âÂ GRA are 1.29Â ÃÂ 10-7 K m2 W-1 and 1.35Â ÃÂ 10-7 K m2 W-1, respectively, which indicates that there is no significant thermal rectification phenomenon. It can also be observed that R decreases monotonically with increasing temperature and coupling strength due to the enhanced Umklapp phonon scattering and the phonon transmission probability across the interface. Phonon density of states, phonon dispersions and participation ratios are evaluated to reveal the mechanism of heat conduction in the heterobilayer. This work contributes the valuable thermal information to modulate the phonon behaviors in 2D heterobilayer based nanoelectronics.",Facet-selective group-III incorporation in InGaAs template assisted selective epitaxy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524107,Nanotechnology,2019 01 02,"InGaAs is a potential candidate for Si replacement in upcoming advanced technological nodes because of its excellent electron transport properties and relatively low interface defect density in dielectric gate stacks. Therefore, integrating InGaAs devices with the established Si platforms is highly important. Using template-assisted selective epitaxy (TASE), InGaAs nanowires can be monolithically integrated with high crystal quality, although the mechanisms of group III incorporation in this ternary material have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we present a detailed study of the compositional variations of InGaAs nanostructures epitaxially grown on Si(111) and Silicon-on-insulator substrates by TASE. We present a combination of XRD data and detailed EELS maps and find that the final Ga/In chemical composition depends strongly on both growth parameters and the growth facet type, leading to complex compositional sub-structures throughout the crystals. We can further conclude that the composition is governed by the facet-dependent chemical reaction rates at low temperature and low V/III ratio, while at higher temperature and V/III ratio, the incorporation is transport limited. In this case we see indications that the transport is a competition between Knudsen flow and surface diffusion."

Spatially variant PSFs were measured on a HRRT for fluorine-18, carbon-11 and gallium-68 using an array of printed point sources. For gallium-68, this required modification of the original design to handle its longer positron range. Using the fluorine-18 measurements and previously published data from Monte-Carlo simulations of positron range, estimated PSFs for carbon-11 and gallium-68 were calculated and compared with experimental data. A double 3D Gaussian function was fitted to the estimated and measured data and used to model the spatially varying PSFs over the scanner field of view (FOV). Differences between the measured and estimated PSFs were quantified using the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and full-width-at-tenth-maximum (FWTM) in the tangential, radial and axial directions. While estimated PSFs were generally in agreement with the measured PSFs over the entire FOV better agreement was observed (FWHM and FWTM differences of less than 10%) when using one of the two sets of positron range simulations, especially for gallium-68 and for the FWTM. Spatially variant radioisotope specific PSFs can be accurately estimated from fluorine-18 measurements and published positron range data.

Furthermore, we observed a conductivity enhancement of the perovskite film by introducing the CdSe TP layer. The combination of both effects induced by the TPs leads to enhancement in the carrier extraction as well as decreased recombination losses in the perovskite solar cells.

I(V) measurements performed on single nanowires have shown a diode-like behaviour corresponding to the radial p.i.n junction inside the Al0.2Ga0.8As shell. Moreover, a current generation under the electron beam was evidenced over the entire radial junction along the nanowires by means of electron beam induced current (EBIC) microscopy.

In this paper, a new method is proposed to combine the advantages of two classifications, which are pulmonary nodule benign-malignant classification and pulmonary nodule image attributes classification, into a deep learning network to improve the accuracy of pulmonary nodule classification. For this purpose, a unique 3D CNN is built to learn image attribute and benign-malignant classification simultaneously. A novel loss function is designed to balance the influence of two different kinds of classifications. The CNN is trained by a publicly available lung image database consortium (LIDC) dataset and is tested by a cross-validation method to predict the risk of a pulmonary nodule being malignant. This proposed method generates the accuracy of 91.47%, which is better than many existing models. Experimental findings show that if the CNN is built properly, the nodule attributes classification and benign-malignant classification can benefit from each other.

Density functional theory as many-body theory provides a principal opportunity for calculating one-electron energies including correlation and relaxation effects, i.e. the true energies of electronic polarons.

Our aim was to evaluate the 3DVH-reconstructed dose systematically building up from simple to complex cases. Therefore, the influence of different field sizes without and with blocking the isocenter was tested. The dose distributions of different radiation techniques, error-free and error-induced VMAT-plans were verified by measuring with films and other detectors in the phantom. It was checked how the inclusion of the dose measured separately in the ArcCHECK-isocenter affects the reconstruction. Thus it was also investigated which detector should be used for the dosimetry in the isocenter. Without including the isocentrically measured dose, the reconstruction for the smallest field (2ââÃââ2 cmÂ²) was 5% (6 MV) and 3.7% (10 MV) higher than measured with an ionization chamber. With increasing field size, the deviation decreased. For fields with blocked isocenters, the reconstructed dose was betweenââ-10.6% andââ-24% lower than determined with a microDiamond. Measurements with the Semiflex of the spinal plan resulted in higher doses than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS) and measured with the film and the other detectors. Through the inclusion of the isocentric dose in the reconstruction its accordance with the film increased mostly. With exception of an error-induced head and neck plan, the induced errors in the reconstructed dose volume histogram became visible, but were underestimated. With the 3DVH-algorithm not every induced-error was detected. The 3DVH underestimated the dose in blocked areas. To protect organs at risk (OAR), these are often blocked. Consequently, there is a risk that a clinical decision is based on a 3DVH that underestimated the dose for the OAR. We recommend including the isocentric dose in the reconstruction. The detector used for the isocentric measurements should be carefully chosen."

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2018 12 07,"We study the effect of impurities on the two types of spin-dimers in the hybrid chain/ladder spin 1/2 quantum magnet Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Four different impurities were used, namely, the non-magnetic Zn (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Al (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu), and magnetic Ni (0.0025 and 0.01 per Cu) and Co (0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1 per Cu). These impurities were doped in high-quality single-crystals synthesized by the floating zone method. The magnetic susceptibility of pristine Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ is analyzed rigorously to confirm that at low temperatures (T $&lt;$ 5 K), the ""free"" spins in the chains undergo a long-distance dimerization as proposed in a recent study [Sahling et al. Nature Phys., \textbf{11}, 255 (2015)]. The effect of impurity on these dimers is analyzed by measuring the specific heat down to T = 0.06 K. We found that even at the lower impurity concentration, the long-distance dimers are significantly severed, but the quantum entangled spin dimerized state of the chains persists. On the other hand, the other type of spin dimers that forms at relatively higher temperatures via an intervening Zhang-Rice singlet are found to be practically unaffected at the lower impurity concentration; but at 1\% doping, even these are found to be considerably severed. The effect of Co impurity turned out to be most unusual displaying a strongly anisotropic response, and with a dimerization gap that suppresses faster along the chain/ladder direction than perpendicular to it as a function of increasing Co concentration.",SnO2-rGO nanocomposite as an efficient electron transport layer for stable perovskite solar cells on AZO substrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524051,Nanotechnology,2018 12 26,"Electron transport layer (ETL) plays an important role in realizing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There are continuous efforts in developing new types of low cost ETLs with improved conductivity and compatibility with perovskite and the conducting electrode. Here, in order to obtain high efficient and stable PSCs on ZnO:Al (AZO) substrate, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is incorporated into SnO2 nanoparticles to form composite ETL. For planar PSC on AZO substrates, SnO2-rGO with a low incorporation ratio of 3 wt% rGO significantly enhances the device short circuit current density (J sc) and the fill factor when compared to the device with pristine SnO2 ETL, leading to an overall power conversion efficiency of 16.8% with negligible hysteresis. The effectiveness of the excited charge transfer process of SnO2-rGO ETL is revealed by time-resolved photoluminescence decay, and by electrochemical impedance spectrum measurements. Furthermore, the solar cell stability is also enhanced due to the incorporation of rGO in the ETL. This work provides a low cost and effective ETL modification strategy for achieving high performance planar PSCs.",Network proteomics of human dermal wound healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524050,Physiological measurement,2019 05 08,The healing of wounds is critical in protecting the human body against environmental factors.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2018 12 14,"Understanding organic-organic interfaces is rather challenging due to their large complexity regarding morphology, molecular orientation at the interface, interdiffusion, and energetics. One additional important but often neglected aspect are chemical reactions occuring at such interfaces. For solid interfaces between pentacene and Buckminster-Fullerene (C60) recently very efficient Diels-Alder (D-A) adduct formation has been reported. Considering the importance of pentacene/C60 as prototypical donor-acceptor combination to study fundamental processes in organic photovoltaics, understanding this effect is essential. In this work, we provide detailed NEXAFS-based investigations with respect to the temperature-dependence and reaction zone depth of this effect. Moreover, we widely vary the interface morphology and observe that the D-A adduct formation is most efficient for bulk heterojunctions of pentacene and C60. By also investigating further material combinations such as PEN/C60-PCBM and interfaces between C60 and functionalized acenes, we observe trends for the occurrence of the D-A adduct formation correlated with the different chemical properties of the involved compounds.",MEH-PPV photophysics: insights from the influence of a nearby 2D quencher.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524048,Nanotechnology,2018 12 17,"The effect of 2D quenching on single chain photophysics was investigated by spin coating 13 nm thick films of polystyrene lightly doped with MEH-PPV onto CVD grown graphene and observing the changes in several photoluminescent (PL) observables. With 99% of the PL quenched, we found a 60% drop in the PL lifetime, along with a significant blue-shift of the PL emission due to the preferential quenching of emission at longer wavelengths. During photo-bleaching, the blue spectral shift observed for isolated polymers was eliminated in the presence of the quencher up until 70% of the polymer was photo-bleached. Results were interpreted using a static disorder induced conjugation length distribution model. The quencher, by opening up a new non-radiative decay channel, ensures that excitons do not have sufficient time to migrate to nearby lower energy chromophores. The reduction of energy transfer into the lowest-energy chromophores thus reduces their rate of photo-bleaching. Finally, the difference between the quenched and non-quenched spectra allows the rate of energy transfer along the polymer backbone to be estimated at â¼2 ns-1.",Improved Hubbard-I approximation impurity solver for quantum impurity models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524047,Journal of physics.

This solver inherits the advantages of both algorithms. In order to demonstrate the power and usefulness of this solver, we use it to study the magnetic phase transitions of single-band and two-band Hubbard models in the framework of single-site dynamical mean-field theory. The calculated results agree well with those obtained by hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver. It is suggested that this solver is very suitable to solve the multi-orbital quantum impurity models efficiently and can be used to study more realistic systems with magnetic long-range order in the future.",Temporal cooperativity of motor proteins under constant force: insights from Kramers' escape problem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524046,Physical biology,2019 02 15,"The microtubule-bound motors kinesin and dynein differ in many respects, a striking difference being that while kinesin is known to function mostly alone, dynein operates in large groups, much like myosinV in actin. Optical tweezer experiments in vitro have shown that the mean detachment time of a bead attached to [Formula: see text] kinesins under stall conditions is a slowly decreasing function of [Formula: see text], while for dyneins, the time increases almost linearly with [Formula: see text]. This makes dynein a team worker, capable of producing and sustaining a large collective force without detaching. We characterize this phenomenon as 'temporal cooperativity' under load. In general, it is unclear which biophysical properties of a single motor determine whether it behaves cooperatively or not in a group. Our theoretical analysis shows that this is determined by two dimensionless parameters: (i) the ratio of single molecule, load-independent detachment and attachment rates and (ii) the ratio of the applied force per motor to the detachment force of a single motor. We show that the attachment-detachment dynamics of a motor assembly may be mapped to the motion of a hypothetical, overdamped Brownian particle in an effective potential, the form of which depends on the load-dependence of binding and unbinding rate of the motor. In this picture, the total number [Formula: see text] of motors is proportional to the inverse temperature and cooperative behaviour arises from the trapping of the particle in the minima of the potential, when present. In the latter case, application of results from Kramers' theory predicts that the mean time of escape of the particle, equivalent to the mean detachment time of the bead under stall, increases exponentially with the number of motors, indicating cooperative behaviour. If the potential does not have minima, the detachment time depends only weakly on [Formula: see text], which suggests non-cooperative behaviour. In the large [Formula: see text] limit, the emergence of cooperative behaviour is shown to be similar to a continuous phase transition.",Decoding motor neuron activity from epimysial thin-film electrode recordings following targeted muscle reinnervation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524045,Journal of neural engineering,2019 01 14,"Surface electromyography (EMG) is currently used as a control signal for active prostheses in amputees who underwent targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) surgery.

We calculate the GSFE in both [Formula: see text]-Fe and Fe-C alloys using the exact muffin-tin orbitals method and the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. Our results show that the GSFE is increased by the presence of interstitial C, and the universal scaling law is used to verify the accuracy of the obtained stacking fault energies. The C-driven change of the GSFE is discussed considering the magnetic contributions. The effective energy barriers for stacking fault, twinning and slip formation are employed to disclose the C effect on the deformation modes, and we also demonstrate that the magnetic structures as a function of volume explain the effect of paramagnetism on the C-driven changes of the stacking fault energies as compared to the hypothetical non-magnetic case."

Collagen-type IV (Col-IV), the major scaffolding component of Basement Membranes (BM), a specialized ECM with multiple biological functions, has the propensity to form networks by self-assembly and supports adhesion of cells such as endothelial cells or stem cells. The preparation of biomimetic Col-IV network-like layers to direct cell responses is difficult. We hypothesize that the morphology of the layer, and especially the density of the available adhesion sites, regulates the cellular adhesion to the layer. The Langmuir monolayer technique allows for preparation of thin layers with precisely controlled packing density at the air-water (A-W) interface. Transferring these layers onto cell culture substrates using the Langmuir-SchÃ¤fer (LS) technique should therefore provide a pathway for preparation of BM mimicking layers with controlled cell adherence properties. In situ characterization using ellipsometry and polarization modulation-infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy of Col-IV layer during compression at the A-W interface reveal that there is linear increase of surface molecule concentration with negligible orientational changes up to a surface pressure of 25 mN m-1. Smooth and homogeneous Col-IV network-like layers are successfully transferred by LS method at 15 mN m-1 onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which is a common substrate for cell culture. In contrast, the organization of Col-IV on PET prepared by the traditionally employed solution deposition method results in rather inhomogeneous layers with the appearance of aggregates and multilayers. Progressive increase in the number of early adherent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) after 24 h by controlling the areal Col-IV density by LS transfer at 10, 15 and 20 mN m-1 on PET is shown. The LS method offers the possibility to control protein characteristics on biomaterial surfaces such as molecular density and thereby, modulate cell responses.",Uncertainties associated with assessing Ontario uranium miners' exposure to radon daughters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524032,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,2019 02 22,"The Ontario uranium miners study is a large (nÂ =Â 28 546) cohort with low levels of radon exposure relative to other uranium miner cohorts. Multiple methods were used over time to estimate annual occupational exposure to radon daughters including: mine-specific extrapolations by mining engineers, area sampling in limited areas of the mines combined with approximate working time and lastly, consistent exposure sampling in different locations of the mine combined with workers' time cards. Nonetheless, estimating exposures involves assumptions that lead to some uncertainty in occupational exposure characterisation arising from the assessment approach and variability within workplace, over time and by individual. An evaluation of the total uncertainty associated with radon daughter exposure estimation in Ontario miners over time has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to identify the contributing sources and assess the total uncertainty associated with estimating occupational radon daughter exposure among underground Ontario uranium miners over the course of uranium mining. The five sources of radon daughter exposure uncertainty evaluated were: natural variations in radon concentration, estimation of working time, precision of the radon measurement method, unintended errors during sampling, and record keeping and transcription of exposure data. These sources were examined separately for the period 1958 to 1967 and then 1968 onward due to changes in radon daughter concentration measurement practices between these periods. The magnitude of uncertainty associated with each of these sources over time were determined by reviewing historical literature on uranium mining in Ontario as well as through expert advice. Using the root sum square method, the total radon daughter exposure uncertainty was found to be 53 to 67% in the earlier period of uranium mining from 1958 to 1967. This decreased to 31 to 39% for the period 1968 to 1996 with natural variations of radon daughter concentrations in mines accounting for the largest percentage of uncertainty. This assessment provides an initial step in understanding the effect of exposure uncertainty on risk estimates. The impact of this uncertainty on the dose-response relationship between radon exposure and cancer risk will be assessed in future work.",Maneuvering and stabilization control of a bipedal robot with a universal-spatial robotic tail.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524031,Bioinspiration & biomimetics,2019 04 08,"This paper analyzes control methodologies to implement maneuvering and stabilization behaviors in a bipedal robot using a bioinspired robotic tail. Looking to nature, numerous animals augment their legs' functionality using a tail nature, numerous animals augment their legs' functionality using a tail to assist with both maneuvering and stabilization; looking to the robotics literature, previous research primarily focuses on single-mass, pendulum-like tails designed to perform a specific task. The overarching goal of this research is to study how bioinspired tail designs may be used in conjunction with low-complexity leg designs to achieve high-performance behaviors. In pursuit of this goal, this paper connects the serpentine universal-spatial robotic tail (USRT) with a biped consisting of a pair of Robotic Modular Legs to study the outer- and inner-loop control considerations necessary to achieve yaw-angle turning and stable leg lifting. The design and modeling of the tail and leg subsystems are presented, along with considerations for sensing the USRT's configuration in real-time. In addition, two inner-loop controllers that map desired tail trajectories into actuation commands are presented: a prescribed velocity approach that only utilizes motor feedback, and a prescribed torque approach that incorporates both feedforward consideration of the tail dynamics and feedback consideration from the tail sensing. Two outer-loop controllers-one for yaw-angle steering (maneuvering), and one for roll-angle disturbance rejection when lifting a foot (stabilization)-are also defined. Case studies including simulation and experimental results are used to validate the outer-loop control approaches.",Tuning the electronic structure of single-walled carbon nanotube by high-pressure H<sub>2</sub> exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524030,Nanotechnology,2018 12 07,"We report on an electronic structure change of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) due to electron doping via high-pressure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure.

Our aim is to investigate whether this difference could result from the different degrees of heterogeneity in sphere distribution between the two medical devices. The 90Y TOF-PET based equivalent uniform doses (EUD) was used for this purpose. 58 consecutive HCC radioembolizations were retrospectively analyzed. Absorbed doses D and Jones-Hoban EUD in lesions were computed. Radioembolization efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. In order to match together the glass and resin spheres survival curves using a 40 Gy-threshold, an efficacy factor of 0.73 and 0.36 has to be applied on their absorbed dose, respectively. Using EUD, a nice matching between glass and resin survival curves was obtained with a better separation of the responding and not responding survival curves. The results clearly support the fact that the activity heterogeneity observed in 90Y TOF-PET post radioembolization does not only result from statistical noise, but also reflects the actual heterogeneity of the spheres distribution.

This work presents a learning-based method to derive patient-specific computed tomography (CT) maps from routine T1-weighted MRI in their native space for attenuation correction of brain PET. We developed a machine-learning-based method using a sequence of alternating random forests under the framework of an iterative refinement model. Anatomical feature selection is included in both training and predication stages to achieve optimal performance. To evaluate its accuracy, we retrospectively investigated 17 patients, each of which has been scanned by PET/CT and MR for brain. The PET images were corrected for attenuation on CT images as ground truth, as well as on pseudo CT (PCT) images generated from MR images. The PCT images showed mean average error of 66.1ââÂ±ââ8.5 HU, average correlation coefficient of 0.974ââÂ±ââ0.018 and average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) larger than 0.85 for air, bone and soft tissue.

Leveraging multi-modality medical images can be highly beneficial for automated tumor segmentation as they provide complementary information that could make the segmentation of tumors more accurate. This paper investigates CNN-based methods for automated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) segmentation using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Specially, a multi-modality convolutional neural network (M-CNN) is designed to jointly learn a multi-modal similarity metric and segmentation of paired CT-MR images. By jointly optimizing the similarity learning error and the segmentation error, the feature learning processes of both modalities are mutually guided. In doing so, the segmentation sub-networks are able to take advantage of the other modality's information. Considering that each modality possesses certain distinctive characteristics, we combine the higher-layer features extracted by a single-modality CNN (S-CNN) and M-CNN to form a combined CNN (C-CNN) for each modality, which is able to further utilize the complementary information of different modalities and improve the segmentation performance. The proposed M-CNN and C-CNN were evaluated on 90 CT-MR images of NPC patients. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods achieve improved segmentation performance compared to their counterparts without multi-modal information fusion and the existing CNN-based multi-modality segmentation methods.",Efficient metallic nanowire welding using the Eddy current method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524023,Nanotechnology,2018 12 17,"In this study, metallic nanowires (M-NWs) such as silver nanowires (AgNWs) and copper nanowires (CuNWs) were welded only at junctions resistively by a novel method using an indirect Eddy current through an inductive power transfer.

For AgNWs, after the welding a decrease of surface roughness could also be observed from 44.5 nm to 26.3 nm, which is similar to the height of a single layer AgNW (22.2 nm) for a bilayer junction. For AgNWs coated on a transparent flexible substrate, after the cyclic bending of 10 000 times, no change of resistance (ÎR/R0) of the AgNWs after the welding was observed and the welded AgNWs were not easily peeled off from the substrate.

Recently, k Q factors for two Farmer-type ionization chambers have been determined experimentally in the entrance channel of 429 MeV/u carbon ions, achieving about a threefold reduction of the uncertainty.

Part A: recording.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524005,Journal of neural engineering,2019 03 13,"Advancement in prosthetic limb technology requires corresponding improvements in the capability of the amputee to naturally control the device via original motor pathways while simultaneously receiving haptic feedback via sensory pathways. Recording efferent axonal activity using a peripheral neural interface (PNI) allows a good tradeoff between invasiveness and selectivity while possibly preserving the phenomenology of controlling the original limb. One such PNI, the thin-film transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (tfTIME), has been shown to be successful in controlling powered prosthetics. However, the tfTIME is highly susceptible to stimulation artifact; thus, using such a PNI to both record efferent motor signals while concurrently stimulating afferent sensory axons in the same nerve is problematic. The micro-channel sieve electrode could also provide a stable, selective, neural interface with larger signal-to-noise levels that are less susceptible to concurrent stimulation artifact or other external noise effects.",Preferentially oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays on non-native substrates and their improved performance as electron transporting layer in halide perovskite solar cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524004,Nanotechnology,2019 03 14,"Anodically formed TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) constitute an optoelectronic platform that is being studied for use as a photoanode in photoelectrocatalytic cells, as an electron transport layer (ETL) in solar cells and photodetectors, and as an active layer for chemiresistive and microwave sensors. For optimal transport of charge carriers in these one-dimensional polycrystalline ordered structures, it is desirable to introduce a preferential texture with the grains constituting the nanotube walls aligned along the transport direction. Through x-ray diffraction analysis, we demonstrate that choosing the right water content in the anodization electrolyte and the use of a post-anodization zinc ion treatment can introduce a preferential texture in sub-micron length transparent TNTAs formed on non-native substrates. The incorporation of 1.5 atom% of Zn in TiO2 nanotubes prior to annealing, was found to consistently result in the strongest preferential orientation along the [001] direction. [001] oriented TNTAs exhibited a responsivity of 523 A W-1 at a bias of 2 V for 365 nm photons, which is among the highest reported performance values for ultraviolet photodetection using titania nanotubes. Furthermore, the textured nanotubes without a Zn2+ treatment showed a significantly enhanced performance in halide perovskite solar cells that used TNTAs as the ETL.",Quantized dislocations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524003,Journal of physics.

However, unlike the phonon which has been quantized for decades, the dislocation has long remained classical. This article is a comprehensive review of the recent progress on quantized dislocations, aka the 'dislon' theory. Since the dislon utilizes quantum field theory to solve materials defects problems, we adopt a pedagogical approach to facilitate understanding for both materials science and condensed matter communities. After introducing a few preliminary concepts of dislocations, we focus on the necessity and pathways of dislocation's quantization in great detail, followed by the interaction mechanism between the dislon and materials electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. We emphasize the formality, the new phenomena, and the predictive power. Imagine the leap from classical lattice wave to quantized phonon; the dislon theory may open up vast opportunities to compute dislocated materials at a full quantum many-body level.",A simple method to monitor the dose rate of secondary cosmic radiation at altitude.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524002,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,2019 02 22,"Monitoring the ambient dose equivalent rate at aviation altitudes is an ambitious task, which requires sophisticated dosemeter systems and the possibility to carry out such measurements on board aircraft.

Here we introduce n-butyl amine (BA) to modulate the growth of perovskite films as well as improve the performance of PeLEDs, and investigate in detail the effects of BA incorporation on the structural, optical, and electrical characteristics of perovskite films. The results indicate that BA would terminate the grain surface and inhibit crystal growth, leading to increased radiative recombination. However, BA overload would make the films loose and recreate shunt paths. The electrical detriment of BA overload outweighs its optical benefit. As a result, optimal PeLEDs can be obtained only with moderate BA incorporation."

Conductive nanofillers, such as graphene nanoplatelets, are characterized by small size, extraordinary surface area to volume ratio, high aspect-ratio and extremely low electrical resistivity. In this work, the dielectric behaviors and the corresponding energy storage capabilities of high aspect-ratio carbon nanofiller/polymer composites were reviewed. At the electrical percolation point, a conductive composite exhibits a sudden and remarkable enhancement in dielectric constant and dielectric loss. The challenge is to maintain the increase in dielectric constant while preventing the increase in dielectric loss. Various physical and chemical methodologies have been followed to overcome this challenge including surface chemistry modifications, physical alignment of nanofillers and utilizing of hybrid mixtures. Promising results were reported to minimize the energy loss due to the conductive network formation. Nanocomposites with a dielectric constant of 103 and dielectric loss of only 0.08 were successfully fabricated.

A discrepancy between thermal measurement and simulation, though, led us to further investigate the TMM properties. We found that the 2-parameter analytic fit commonly used to represent the attenuation of the TMM in the computer modeling was not adequate over the entire frequency range of interest, 1 MHz to 8 MHz in this study, indicating that we and others may have not been characterizing TMMs, and possibly tissue, optimally. By comparing measurements and simulations, we found that a 3-parameter analytic fit for attenuation gave a more accurate value for attenuation at 1 MHz and 2 MHz, and using that fit the temperature rise measurements in the TMM that agreed more closely with the simulation results.",Role of tetrahedrally coordinated dopants in palladium hydrides on their superconductivity and inverse isotope effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523986,Journal of physics.

The urinary excretion from individuals involved in one of the incidents increased steadily with time, peaking around two to three years before decreasing. This pattern is described in Part 4 of the OIR series using the '238PuO2, ceramic' model. This non-monotonic behaviour, explained as being due to fragmentation and dissolution, was not specific to the incident, but observed in other incidents. The urinary excretion data collected from individuals involved in another incident showed dissolution behaviour between Type M and Type S. Finally, the bioassay data from yet another incident showed a pattern that appears to represent behaviour more insoluble than Type S, which is possibly a result of self-heating due to the decay heat from 238Pu.

The 2H phase is found to have increasingly higher energy than the 1T phase at a smaller ribbon width, and the width for favoring the 1T phase reaches up to 2.50 nm for WSe2. The phase crossover is due to higher coordination of edge M atoms in 1T phase than in 2H phase and an interesting electronic reconstruction of 1T lattice in the ribbon interior. The edge configuration of 1T phase diminishes the edge dangling bonds and thereby enhances the stability of MX2 nanoribbons.

Such a dramatic effect results from the high stability of the substituting Mn2+ ion (3d 5) in its high-spin state, which opposes any variation to its electronic state (configuration), perturbing thereby interactions within the Fe sub-lattice between the Fe ions surrounding the substituent. Several investigations ascertained that the structural transformation in LnFeAsO compounds (Ln: lanthanide) cannot be ascribed to lattice degrees of freedom, but rather to electronic or spin ones. In this context, even an extremely low concentration of Mn2+ ions diluted in the Fe sub-lattice produces a reduction of the electronic degree of freedom of the system, thus hindering the structural transformation and the magnetic transition.",Tumor co-segmentation in PET/CT using multi-modality fully convolutional neural network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523964,Physics in medicine and biology,2018 12 21,"Automatic tumor segmentation from medical images is an important step for computer-aided cancer diagnosis and treatment.

PET/CT scanner is nowadays widely used in the clinic, and is able to provide both metabolic information and anatomical information through integrating PET and CT into the same utility. In this study, we proposed a novel multi-modality segmentation method based on a 3D fully convolutional neural network (FCN), which is capable of taking account of both PET and CT information simultaneously for tumor segmentation. The network started with a multi-task training module, in which two parallel sub-segmentation architectures constructed using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were designed to automatically extract feature maps from PET and CT respectively. A feature fusion module was subsequently designed based on cascaded convolutional blocks, which re-extracted features from PET/CT feature maps using a weighted cross entropy minimization strategy. The tumor mask was obtained as the output at the end of the network using a softmax function. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on a clinic PET/CT dataset of 84 patients with lung cancer.

Earthworms are characterized by segmented body structures, known as metameres, composed of longitudinal and circular muscles which during locomotion are contracted and relaxed periodically in order to generate a peristaltic wave that propagates backwards with respect to the worm's traveling direction; simultaneously, microscopic bristle-like structures (setae) on each metamere coordinately protrude or retract to provide varying traction with the ground, thus enabling the worm to burrow or crawl. The proposed soft robot replicates the muscle functionalities and setae mechanisms of earthworms employing pneumatically-driven actuators and 3D-printed casings. Using the notion of controllable subspace, we show that friction plays an indispensable role in the generation and control of locomotion in robots of this type.

An established approach is the expansion of the target volume to account for the motion. An alternative approach is couch-tracking, in which the patient is continually moved to compensate the intrafractional motion. However, couch-tracking itself might induce uncertainty of the patient's body position, because the body is non-rigid. One hundred healthy volunteers were positioned supine on a robotic couch. Optical markers were placed on the torso of the volunteers as well as on the couch, and their positions were tracked with an optical surface measurement system. Using these markers, the uncertainty of the body position relative to the couch position was estimated while the couch was static or moving. Over the included 83 healthy volunteers, the median of the uncertainty increased by 0.8âmm (SI), 0.4âmm (LR) and 0.4âmm (AP) when the couch moved. Couch motion was found to increase the uncertainty of the body position relative to the couch. However, this uncertainty is one order of magnitude smaller than the intrafractional tumor motion amplitudes to be compensated.

The relationship between the thermal conductivity and the vibrational density-of-states of the nanotubes was also investigated.",A new method for modelling the tongue-and-groove in treatment planning systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523940,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 06 06,"Commercial TPSs typically model the tongue-and-groove (TG) by extending the projections of the leaf sides by a certain constant width. However, this model may produce discrepancies of as much as 7%-10% in the calculated average doses, especially for the High Definition multi-leaf collimator (MLC) (Hernandez et al 2017 Phys. Med. Biol. 62 6688-707). The purpose of the present study is to introduce and validate a new method for modelling the TG that uses a non constant TG width. We provide the theoretical background and a detailed methodology to determine the optimal shape of this TG width from measurements and we fit an empirical function to the TG width that depended on two parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Parameter [Formula: see text] represents the TG width and [Formula: see text] introduces a curvature correction in the width near the leaf tip end. The new TG model was implemented in MATLAB and when the curvature correction was zero ([Formula: see text]) it caused the same discrepancies as the constant width model used by the Eclipse TPS. On the other hand, when the experimentally determined [Formula: see text] was used the new model's calculations were in close agreement with measurements, with all differences in average doses [Formula: see text]1%. Additionally, film dosimetry was used to successfully validate the potential of the new TG model to recreate the fine spatial details associated to TG effects. We also showed that the parameters [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] depend solely on the MLC design by evaluating three different linear accelerators for each MLC model considered, namely Varian's High Definition and Millennium120 MLCs. In conclusion, a new method was presented that greatly improves the TG modelling. The present method can be easily implemented in commercial TPSs and has the potential to further increase their accuracy, especially for MLCs with rounded leaf ends.",Chemistry in confined space through the eyes of surface science-2D porous materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523939,Journal of physics.

These effects have been observed recently under two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials such as a graphene and boron nitride and for the case of supported 2D-porous oxides, including silicates, aluminosilicates and zeolite nanosheets. This review summarizes the current state of the art in this area of research and how confinement effects in 2D systems relate to those found in 3D porous and layered materials.

Thus, the effect of plasma exposure times (0, 1, 3, and 5 min) was investigated on the morphology, loading efficiency, release profile, and osteogenesis activity. The successful loading of RSV on the SF nanofibers was proved by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, Differential scanning calorimetry, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated that the RSV release was prolonged over a period of 21 d for plasma treated mats, while the non-plasma treated samples released the whole drug after 72 h. Moreover, the dose of RSV was controlled by the plasma exposure times, in which the highest amount of the released RSV was achieved after 3 min exposing to plasma. As suggested by MTT assay, the released amounts of RSV had no toxicity on the seeded human adipose tissue-derived stem cells and enhanced their proliferation. Moreover, using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and alizarin red staining proved that RSV-immobilized SF mats stimulate both early and late osteogenic gene differentiation in comparison with pure SF nanofibers. However, the highest differentiation was observed on the SF nanofibers treated with argon plasma for 3 min. The results support the potential of plasma treatment on sustained release of the RSV from SF nanofibers for osteogenesis enhancement.","Mode confinement, interface mass-smudging, and sample length effects on phonon transport in thin nanocomposite superlattices.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523937,Journal of physics.

This paper proposes a scheme to detect the magnetoelectric effect by anomalous, equal-spin Andreev tunneling in NCS/ferromagnet contacts. The proposal relies on the ability to generate spin-polarized triplet pairing by passing an electric current through an NCS. Such an induced triplet pairing bears a similarity to the paradigmatic nonunitary pairing in triplet superfluids with a complex vector order parameter [Formula: see text]. The qualitative difference is that the induced nonunitary state can be realised in NCSs with a purely real [Formula: see text] by breaking the time-reversal symmetry in current-biased setups.

After reaction with H2S, the azido moiety is reduced to amine group, and the probe releases the self-immolative linker and regenerates the fluorophore with internal charge transfer effect. SN-N3 is responsive to H2S in a ratiometric mode, exhibiting excellent sensitivity and high selectivity. The probe is demonstrated to be localized in lysosomes with high specificity. More importantly, SN-N3 is successfully demonstrated to image lysosomal H2S in a ratiometric manner.

To integrate the powder MOFs-derived carbon into feasible engineered materials, a facile strategy to fabricate integrated flexible film is developed by growing MOFs nanoparticles on polyimide electrospun nanofibers, followed by calcination, to fabricate freestanding carbon nanofiber membranes decorated with porous carbon. Then vertically polyaniline nanowire arrays are uniformly deposited on the hierarchical porous carbon substrates by in situ polymerization. Thanks to the good distribution of MOFs-derived porous carbon on carbon nanofibers and the compact configuration interwoven by conducting polymers, the designed hybrid electrode could be used directly as a freestanding electrode for supercapacitors, which displayed a high specific capacitance of 1268 F g-1.

The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives.

The faster photoresponse speed and a broader response wavelength (from UV to visible range) have been achieved by constructing a type-II ZnO/rubrene heterointerface. Performance enhancement is believed to arise from the well-matching band alignment and highly efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the heterointerface.

On one hand, direct conversion detectors inherently offer better resolution characteristics in terms of a higher modulation transfer function (MTF), in comparison to the indirect CsI:Tl PPS x-ray imager. On the other hand, especially at lower doses, this superior performance of the direct imager is seldom retained in its detective quantum efficiency (DQE) curves. It is well known that a-Se PPS x-ray imagers suffer from high additive electronic noise originating from the from the amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film transistor (TFT) array that is being used in the current back-plane technology. This degrades the noise power spectrum (NPS) and subsequently the overall DQE. To address this deficiency, we propose to replace the PPS back-plane by active pixel sensor (APS) back-plane technology, which has the potential to reduce the back-plane electronic noise by amplifying the input signal, especially at low doses. The proposed APS is based on amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) TFT technology, which can offer high mobility (5-20âcm2 V-1 s-1), low leakage current (<10-13 A) and low flicker noise (Hooge's parameter Î± H ~ 1.5 [Formula: see text] 10-3), leading to better imager noise performance. To test our hypothesis, we used linear cascaded systems analysis to model the imaging performance (MTF, NPS and DQE) of the PPS and APS a-Se direct imagers. This model was first validated using experimentally measured data obtained for a 85 Âµm pixel pitch a-Se/a-Si TFT PPS imager. Using this model, we analyzed the noise performance of the direct a-Se and indirect CsI:Tl x-ray a-IGZO APS imagers at different dose and electronic noise levels. Obtained results clearly showed that lowering back-plane electronic noise can significantly improve the performance of the a-Se/a-IGZO TFT APS imager. Our simulated results showed that a higher DQE at lower radiation doses (maximum DQE of 0.6 can be achieved at an exposure level of 1 ÂµGy) can be achieved with the a-Se detector, thereby making this combination a promising candidate for low dose applications like DBT.",Energy-modulated x-ray fluorescence and luminescence emissions from therapeutic nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523915,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 08,"In this study, we have investigated the possibility of modulating x-ray fluorescence (XF) and x-ray luminescence (XL) emissions from therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) by fine-tuning the energy of incident x-rays from benchtop x-ray sources. We have carried out detailed experimental studies to determine the strength of XF and XL emissions from Y2O3:Eu3+ and LaF3:Tb3+ NPs being irradiated with x-rays from benchtop x-ray sources operated with different tube-voltages and coupled to various filter configurations. These studies demonstrated that low-energy x-rays with average energy at around 10-15âkeV are the most efficient to stimulate XL emission from the Y2O3:Eu3+ and LaF3:Tb3+ NPs. The efficiency falls quickly when x-ray energies go above or below the optimum energy range. As one would expect, x-rays with average energy just above the corresponding absorption edge of the target metal would be the most efficient in inducing XF emission. In this study, we have also demonstrated that one could fine-tune the incident x-ray energy to modulate the XL and XF emissions, such as (a) selectively inducing either XL or XF emission from the same type of NPs, (b) inducing preferential XL activation of Y2O3:Eu3+ over LaF3:Eu3+ or controlling the ratio of XL activation of these two types of NPs, and (c) introducing preferential XF emission from one type of NPs over the other. As a potential application, one could optimize the energy-characteristics of the incident x-rays to facilitate multiplexed combinatorial delivery of photodynamic therapy (X-PDT), where different agents could be administrated and then selectively activated in user-defined spatial and temporal patterns to fulfill combinatorial therapeutic effects. The understanding gained through this study could prove critical for enhancing the therapeutic delivery in X-PDT, and for attaining high-quality x-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT) and x-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) images while minimizing the x-ray dose to the sample.",Numerical investigation of low-noise airfoils inspired by the down coat of owls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523914,Bioinspiration & biomimetics,2019 04 08,"Numerical analysis of airfoil geometries inspired by the down coat of the night owl is presented. The bioinspired geometry consists of an array of 'finlet fences', which is placed near the trailing edge of the baseline (NACA 0012) airfoil. Two fences with maximum nondimensional heights, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are investigated, where [Formula: see text] is the displacement thickness at 2.9% chord upstream of the airfoil trailing edge. Wall-resolved large eddy simulations are performed at chord-based Reynolds number, [Formula: see text], flow Mach number, [Formula: see text], and angle of attack, [Formula: see text]. The simulation results show significant reductions in unsteady surface pressure and farfield radiated noise with the fences, in agreement with the measurements available in the literature. Analysis of the results reveals that the fences increase the distance between the boundary layer turbulence (source) and the airfoil trailing (scattering) edge, which is identified to be the mechanism behind high-frequency noise reduction. These reductions are larger for the taller fence as the source-scattering edge separation is greater. Two-point correlations show that the fences reduce the spanwise coherence at low frequencies for separation distances greater than a fence pitch (distance between two adjacent fences) and increase the coherence for smaller distances, the increase being higher for the taller fence. This increase in coherence and the reduced obliqueness of the leading edge of the fence are hypothesized to be responsible for the small increase in farfield noise at low frequencies observed in the simulations with the taller fence.",In situ durability of various carbon supports against carbon corrosion during fuel starvation in a PEM fuel cell cathode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523913,Nanotechnology,2019 01 02,"In this study, the degradation of different cathode carbon supports is investigated in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

During the startup and shutdown of PEMFCs, the individual electrode potential can be measured in situ using a dynamic hydrogen electrode. The cathode potential increases instantaneously to 1.4 V in one attempt, when H2/air boundaries are developed on the anode side during the fuel starvation, leading to significant carbon corrosion. The corrosion rates of various carbon supports are calculated from the concentration of gases, such as CO2, CO and SO2, emitted from the cathode outlet, measured directly in situ by Fourier transform infrared gas analysis.

When a protective apron is worn the scattered field that reaches the dosemeter is different from the case where no protection is used; this study analyses the changes in the response of seven passive and eight active personal dosemeters (APDs) when they are placed above a lead or lead equivalent garment for S-Cs and x-ray diagnostic qualities. Monte Carlo simulations are used to support the experimental results. It is found that for passive dosemeters, the influence on the dosemeter's response to the lead or lead equivalent was within the range 15%-38% for the x-ray qualities.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2018 12 17,"Recently it was shown that under oscillatory shear at zero temperature an amorphous solid transitions from asymptotically periodic to asymptotically diffusive steady-state at a critical maximal strain amplitude. Current understanding of the physics behind this transition is lacking. Here we show, using computer simulations, evidence that the diffusivity of the vector of coordinates of the particles comprising an amorphous solid, when subject to oscillatory shear, undergoes a second order phase transition at the reversibility-irreversibility transition point. We explain how such a transition is consistent with dissipative forced dynamics on a complex energy landscape, such as is known to exist in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that as the forcing increases, more and more state-space volume becomes accessible to the system, making it less probable for the state-space trajectory of the system to self-intersect and form a limit-cycle, which explains the slowing-down observed at the transition.",Approximate and explicit expression of optical forces and pull-in instability of a silicon nano-optomechanical device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523891,Nanotechnology,2019 01 02,"Nano-optomechanical systems actuated by optical forces enable many interesting scientific and technological applications. They are vulnerable to the effects of surface stress and Casimir forces. Therefore, calculation of optical forces is essential for the reliability applications of these advanced devices. In this paper, an approximate and explicit expression is developed for the evaluation of the optical force existing between a waveguide and a substrate through the effective refractive index. The influences of surface stress and Casimir forces on the pull-in instability of a silicon nano-optomechanical device actuated by optical forces are investigated. It is found that if neglecting the effect of surface stress, the maximum size, which indicates the device can be safely fabricated, will be over-predicted. The surface stress reduces the critical optical power and its effect is more significant for a slender waveguide."

The studied NWs show a sharp plasma resonance at a photon energy of about 125 meV in the case of continuous wave excitation by a CO2 laser. Probing the same NWs with the pulsed free-electron laser with peak electric field strengths up to several 10 kV cm-1 reveals a power-dependent redshift to about 95 meV and broadening of the plasmonic resonance.

It must be designed in such a way that it can produce proper augmented control moments modulated by a closed-loop attitude controller for active stabilization. We propose a tailless FW-MAV with a wing stroke plane modulation mechanism, namely NUS-Roboticbird, which maneuvers by only using its flapping wings for both propulsion and attitude control. The flying vehicle has four wings comprised by two pairs, and each pair of wings and its stroke plane are driven by a motor and a servo, respectively. Attitude control moments of roll, pitch and yaw are generated by vectoring a pair of thrusts, which result from changing the flapping frequency (or motor speed) and wing stroke plane of the two pairs of wings. Free-flight tests show that the vehicle can climb and descend vertically (throttle control), fly sideways left and right (roll control), fly forwards and backwards (pitch control), rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise (yaw control), hover in mid-air (active self-stabilization), and maneuver in the figure-of-8 and fast forward/backward flight. These abilities are especially important for surveillance and autonomous flight in terms of obstacle avoidance in an indoor environment. Flight test data show that an effective mechanical control mechanism and control gains for attitude-controlled flights for roll, pitch and yaw are achieved, in particular, yaw control. Currently, the vehicle weighing 31âg and having a wingspan of 22âcm can perform fast forward flight at a speed of about 5 m s-1 (18 km h-1) and endure 3.5âmin in flight with a useful payload of a 4.5âg onboard camera for surveillance.",Physics and design for 20% and 25% efficiency nanowire array solar cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523878,Nanotechnology,2018 12 26,"Bottom-up fabricated single-junction III-V nanowire array solar cells have shown efficiency up to 15.3%, which is approximately half of the conventional Shockley-Queisser detailed balance efficiency limit of 33.6%.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2018 12 14,"Solar thermal fuels (STFs) are an unconventional paradigm for solar energy conversion and storage which is attracting renewed attention. In this concept, a material absorbs sunlight and stores the energy chemically via an induced structural change, which can later be reversed to release the energy as heat. An example is the azobenzene molecule which has a cis-trans photoisomerization with these properties, and can be tuned by chemical substitution and attachment to templates such as carbon nanotubes, small molecules, or polymers. By analogy to the Shockley-Queisser limit for photovoltaics, we analyze the maximum attainable efficiency for STFs from fundamental thermodynamic considerations. Microscopic reversibility provides a bound on the quantum yield of photoisomerization due to fluorescence, regardless of details of photochemistry. We emphasize the importance of analyzing the free energy, not just enthalpy, of the metastable molecules, and find an efficiency limit for conversion to stored chemical energy equal to the Shockley-Queisser limit. STF candidates from a recent high-throughput search are analyzed in light of the efficiency limit.",Magnetic properties of oxygen doped samarium clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523876,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 01 09,"Here we present the results of experimental study of magnetic properties of samarium clusters doped with a single oxygen atom. In a recent theoretical study it was observed that for pure Sm clusters a transition from fully non-magnetic to weakly magnetic occurs due to a valence change occurring at a size of eight atoms. Here we found, first, that pure Sm clusters could not be synthesized due to the strong oxidation tendency of Sm and the inability to sufficiently remove oxygen from the setup. Therefore, we studied Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters. Since the oxygen contributes to the binding, the valence transition for Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters may be expected to occur for a smaller cluster size than for pure Sm clusters. Indeed from our experiments the valence transition is indicated to occur for [Formula: see text] Sm atoms instead of [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, the observed magnetic moment as function of cluster size for Sm[Formula: see text]O clusters shows a strong dependency of the magnetic moment on the cluster size. A large total magnetic moment is observed for Sm[Formula: see text]O, Sm[Formula: see text]O, Sm[Formula: see text]O and Sm[Formula: see text]O compared to the smaller moment for Sm[Formula: see text]O to Sm[Formula: see text]O and Sm[Formula: see text]O to Sm[Formula: see text]O.",Compressed sensing reconstruction of synthetic transmit aperture dataset for volumetric diverging wave imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523875,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 01 10,"A high volume rate and high performance ultrasound imaging method based on a matrix array is proposed by using compressed sensing (CS) to reconstruct the complete dataset of synthetic transmit aperture (STA) from three-dimensional (3D) diverging wave transmissions (i.e. 3D CS-STA). Hereto, a series of apodized 3D diverging waves are transmitted from a fixed virtual source, with the ith row of a Hadamard matrix taken as the apodization coefficients in the ith transmit event. Then CS is used to reconstruct the complete dataset, based on the linear relationship between the backscattered echoes and the complete dataset of 3D STA. Finally, standard STA beamforming is applied on the reconstructed complete dataset to obtain the volumetric image. Four layouts of element numbering for apodizations and transmit numbers of 16, 32 and 64 are investigated through computer simulations and phantom experiments. Furthermore, the proposed 3D CS-STA setups are compared with 3D single-line-transmit (SLT) and 3D diverging wave compounding (DWC). The results show that, (i) 3D CS-STA has competitive lateral resolutions to 3D STA, and their contrast ratios (CRs) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) approach to those of 3D STA as the number of transmit events increases in noise-free condition. (ii) the tested 3D CS-STA setups show good robustness in complete dataset reconstruction in the presence of different levels of noise. (iii) 3D CS-STA outperforms 3D SLT and 3D DWC. More specifically, the 3D CS-STA setup with 64 transmit events and the Random layout achieves ~31% improvement in lateral resolution, ~14% improvement in ratio of the estimated-to-true cystic areas, a higher volume rate, and competitive CR/CNR when compared with 3D DWC.

When a TA module is encoded on a plasmid, the short lifetime of antitoxin sRNA compared to toxin mRNAs mediates post-segregational killing (PSK) that contribute the plasmid maintenance, while some of the chromosomal encoded TA loci have been reported to contribute to persister formation in response to a specific upstream signal. Some of the well studied type-I TA systems such as hok/sok are known to have a rather complex regulatory mechanism. Transcribed full-length toxin mRNAs fold such that the ribosome binding site is not accessible and hence cannot be translated. The mRNAs are slowly processed by RNases, and the truncated mRNAs can be either translated or bound by antitoxin sRNA to be quickly degraded. We analyze the role of this extra processing by a mathematical model. We first consider the PSK scenario, and demonstrate that the extra processing compatibly ensures the high toxin expression upon complete plasmid loss, without inducing toxin expression upon acquisition of a plasmid or decrease of plasmid number to a non-zero number. We further show that the extra processing help filtering the transcription noise, avoiding random activation of toxins in transcriptionally regulated TA systems as seen in chromosomal ones. The present model highlights impacts of the slow processing reaction, offering insights on why the slow processing reactions are commonly identified in multiple type-I TA systems.",Temperature dependent Young's modulus of ZnO nanowires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523872,Nanotechnology,2018 12 17,"A thermal resonant method was developed to accurately determine the temperature-dependent Young's moduli of nanowires.

In the present paper it is shown that in the finite crystal this behavior is observed only until a certain period of time when a sharp increase of the oscillation amplitude is realized. This phenomenon, further referred to as the thermal echo, occurs periodically, with the period proportional to the crystal length. The amplitude for each subsequent echo is lower than for the previous one. It is obtained analytically that the time-dependence of the kinetic temperature can be described by an infinite sum of the Bessel functions with multiple indices. It is also shown that the thermal echo in the thermodynamic limit is described by the Airy function."

Despite possessing fascinating structural and mechanical properties C3N monolayers weakly bind H2 molecules. However, our van der Waals corrected simulations revealed that the binding properties of H2 on C3N could be enhanced considerably by suitable Sc and Ti doping. The stabilities of Sc and Ti dopants on a C3N surface has been verified by means of reaction barrier calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Upon doping with C3N, the existence of partial positive charges on both Sc and Ti causes multiple H2 molecules to bind to the dopants through electrostatic interactions with adsorption energies that are within an ideal range. A drastically high H2 storage capacity of 9.0 wt% could be achieved with two-sided Sc/Ti doping that ensures the promise of C3N as a high-capacity H2 storage material.",Local insight into the La-induced structural phase transition in multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics by x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523853,Journal of physics.

The hybridization modifies the energy-momentum dispersions of the IPS on PbPc films as observed by angle-resolved two-photon photoemission. On the PbPc 1 monolayer film, the IPS band forms a band gap and back-folding appears at the first Brillouin zone boundary due to the periodic potential by the adsorbate lattice. The modification of the dispersion is accompanied by the intensity enhancement of the IPS. We attributed the origin of the modified dispersion and intensity enhancement to a hybridization of the IPS with a molecule-derived unoccupied level. From the photon energy-dependent measurement on multilayer films, we have found the diffuse unoccupied molecular level in the vicinity of the IPS. The tail part of the IPS wave function in the substrate is enhanced by the hybridization with the unoccupied state, and thus strengthens the transition from the occupied substrate band to the hybridized IPS.",Achieving short high-quality gate-all-around structures for horizontal nanowire field-effect transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523834,Nanotechnology,2018 12 17,"We introduce a fabrication method for gate-all-around nanowire field-effect transistors. Single nanowires were aligned perpendicular to underlying bottom gates using a resist-trench alignment technique. Top gates were then defined aligned to the bottom gates to form gate-all-around structures. This approach overcomes significant limitations in minimal obtainable gate length and gate-length control in previous horizontal wrap-gated nanowire transistors that arise because the gate is defined by wet-etching. In the method presented here gate-length control is limited by the resolution of the electron-beam-lithography process. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by fabricating a device with an independent bottom gate, top gate, and gate-all-around structure as well as a device with three independent gate-all-around structures with 300, 200, and 150 nm gate length. Our method enables us to achieve subthreshold swings as low as 38 mV dec-1 at 77 K for a 150 nm gate length.",Multiscale modeling and decoding algorithms for spike-field activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523833,Journal of neural engineering,2019 01 14,"Behavior is encoded across multiple spatiotemporal scales of brain activity. Modern technology can simultaneously record various scales, from spiking of individual neurons to large neural populations measured with field activity.

Using a two-orbital model on the emergent honeycomb lattice, we find that the resonance states are dramatically different for [Formula: see text]-wave pairing and topological nontrivial pairings. When the magnetic impurity is located at one site of the emergent honeycomb lattice, i.e. the center of the AB spot of the moirÃ© pattern, the spacial distributions of the resonance states will break both the threefold and twofold rotation symmetries of [Formula: see text] point group for pairing symmetries which belong to the irreducible representations of this point group.

Thick-shell ZnCdS:Mn/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique advantages in UV signal sensitisation due to their long PL lifetime, as well as stable emission matched with CCD's response. Herein, a single-channel UV panoramic detection system based on these Mn-doped QDs has been proposed. The QDs@PMMA film was attached on a Si-based CCD camera versus a tapered fibre, and an optical chopper was mounted before the QDs@PMMA film. The long lifetime fluorescence originating from UV signal could be still collected by the CCD camera when the chopper is in the 'off' state, hence the UV/vis signal ratio is significantly enhanced.",PDE-constrained LDDMM via geodesic shooting and inexact Gauss-Newton-Krylov optimization using the incremental adjoint Jacobi equations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523830,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 01 07,"The class of non-rigid registration methods proposed in the framework of PDE-constrained large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping is a particularly interesting family of physically meaningful diffeomorphic registration methods. Inexact Gauss-Newton-Krylov optimization has shown an excellent numerical accuracy and an extraordinarily fast convergence rate in this framework. However, the Galerkin representation of the non-stationary velocity fields does not provide proper geodesic paths. In this work, we propose a method for PDE-constrained LDDMM parameterized in the space of initial velocity fields under the EPDiff equation. The derivation of the gradient and the Hessian-vector products are performed on the final velocity field and transported backward using the adjoint and the incremental adjoint Jacobi equations. This way, we avoid the complex dependence on the initial velocity field in the computations. We also avoid the computation of the adjoint equation and its incremental counterpart that has been recently identified as a subtle problem in PDE-constrained LDDMM. The proposed method provides geodesics in the framework of PDE-constrained LDDMM, and it shows performance competing with benchmark PDE-constrained LDDMM and EPDiff-LDDMM methods.",Flexibility defines structure in crystals of amphiphilic DNA nanostars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523829,Journal of physics.

We have recently introduced a novel platform for the one-pot preparation of crystalline DNA frameworks supported by a combination of Watson-Crick base pairing and hydrophobic forces (Brady et al 2017 Nano Lett. 17 3276-81). Here we use small angle x-ray scattering and coarse-grained molecular simulations to demonstrate that, as opposed to available all-DNA approaches, amphiphilic motifs do not rely on structural rigidity to support long-range order. Instead, the flexibility of amphiphilic DNA building-blocks is a crucial feature for successful crystallisation."

A 2D linear array or scanning mechanism is typically required for 3D quasi-static elastography, requiring expensive and specifically designed hardware. In this study, we propose a novel method based on a commercial electromagnetic tracking system for freehand 3D quasi-static elastography with 1D linear array. Phantom experiments are performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. During data acquisition, the probe contacts the surface of an elasticity phantom and moves in the elevational direction, while applying sinusoidal-like axial compression to the phantom. For each frame of ultrasound data, the 3D coordinates and orientations of the probe are obtained from an electromagnetic tracking system. A correlation-based algorithm is adopted to obtain a series of axial strain images. Volumetric strain data are reconstructed by using the recorded 3D coordinates and orientations of the probe corresponding to each strain image. The diameters of inclusions are then obtained from the slice plots of the volumetric strain data. The volumes of inclusions are estimated from the isosurface plots. The experimental result shows that the volume estimation of the inclusions has good accuracy, with errors within 2%, while the diameters of the inclusions estimated from three orthogonal planes have larger errors up to 18%. In conclusion, the present framework would promise a reliable and effective solution for freehand 3D quasi-static elastography with 1D linear array.",A feasibility study of spatiotemporally integrated radiotherapy using the LQ model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523816,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 06 06,"This paper investigates the feasibility of spatiotemporally modulated radiotherapy (STMRT)-integrated model with explicit constraints on the tumor dose heterogeneity. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of the tumor dose heterogeneity on the tumor biologically effective dose (BED) achievable and optimal fractionation. We propose an STMRT model that simultaneously optimizes the dose distributions and fractionation schedule for each individual case with the maximum and minimum constraints on the tumor BED to explicitly control the level of tumor dose heterogeneity. Sixteen thoracic phantom cases were planned using (1) STMRT and (2) standard fractionation (60 Gy in 30 fractions fixed) IMRT. Constraints on the organs-at-risk (OAR) BED were identical for both plans. BEDs were calculated using the [Formula: see text] ratio of 10 Gy for the tumor and 3 Gy for all OARs. The maximum tumor BED for STMRT plans was constrained to be less than 100%-150% of the maximum tumor BED resulted from the standard fractionation plans. The mean tumor BED from STMRT plans was up to 110.7%, 128.3%, 135.0% and 148.0% of that from the standard fractionation plans when the maximum tumor BED was constrained to be less than 100%, 120%, 130% and 150% of the maximum BED achieved using the standard plans. The optimal number of fractions varied widely for different phantom geometries for the same radiobiological parameter values. The increase in the tumor BED and the range of optimal fractionation was larger with a larger tumor dose heterogeneity allowed. The results have shown the feasibility of personalizing fractionation schedule using an STMRT integrated model to deliver a maximum feasible BED to the tumor for a fixed OAR BED. The potential increase in the tumor BED was positively correlated to the tumor dose heterogeneity allowed.",Prediction of finger kinematics from discharge timings of motor units: implications for intuitive control of myoelectric prostheses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523815,Journal of neural engineering,2019 03 13,The aim of the study was to characterize the accuracy in the identification of motor unit discharges during natural movements using high-density electromyography (EMG) signals and to investigate their correlation with finger kinematics.,Engulfment control of platinum nanoparticles into oxidized silicon substrates for fabrication of dense solid-state nanopore arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523814,Nanotechnology,2018 12 17,"We found that platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, upon annealing at high temperature of 1000 Â°C, are engulfed into amorphous fused-silica or thermal oxide silicon substrates. The same phenomenon was previously published for gold (Au) nanoparticles. Similar to the Au nanoparticles, the engulfed Pt nanoparticles connect to the surface of the substrates through conical nanopores, and the size of the Pt nanoparticles decreases with increasing depth of the nanopores. We explain the phenomena as driven by the formation of platinum oxide by reaction of the platinum with atmospheric oxygen, with platinum oxide evaporating to the environment. We found that the use of Pt provides much better controllability than the use of Au. Due to the high vapor pressure of platinum oxide, the engulfment of the Pt nanoparticles into oxidized silicon (SiO2) substrates is faster than of Au nanoparticles. At high temperature annealing we also find that the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles on the substrate surface is insignificant. As a result, the Pt nanoparticles are uniformly engulfed into the substrates, leading to an opportunity for patterning dense nanopore arrays. Moreover, the use of oxidized Si substrates enables us to precisely control the depth of the nanopores since the engulfment of Pt nanoparticles stops at a short distance above the SiO x /Si interface. After subsequent etching steps, a membrane with dense nanopore through-holes with diameters down to sub-30 nm is obtained. With its simple operation and high controllability, this fabrication method provides an alternative for rapid patterning of dense arrays of solid-state nanopores at low-cost.",Inter-subject analysis of transfer function coherence in studies of dynamic cerebral autoregulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523813,Physiological measurement,2019 05 08,"The gain and phase of the arterial blood pressure (BP)-cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) relationship, assessed by transfer function analysis (TFA), are widely used dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA) metrics, but their reliability depend on the statistical significance of the magnitude squared coherence (MSC) function.

At present, it is difficult to directly measure the distribution of the electric current delivered by electrodes inside tissues. By applying low-frequency ([Formula: see text]1âkHz) external electrical brain stimulation (EBS), the low-frequency conductivity around the cells is uneven due to asymmetric cellular structures. We propose a method of electrical property imaging using the measured one component magnetic flux density by EBS and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The low-frequency electrical anisotropic conductivity tensor can be decomposed into the ion concentration and the mobility tensor of charge carriers. By analyzing the role of the diffusion tensor, we reconstruct the apparent anisotropic tensor by EBS using the [Formula: see text]-component of measured magnetic flux density data and the estimated diffusion tensor. Using only the measured [Formula: see text]-component of magnetic flux density, the orthotropic conductivity tensor can be approximately recovered. The orthotropic conductivity tensor is not exact, but only reflects the extracellular space (ECS) effects. By comparing the components of orthotropic tensor and diffusion tensor, we stably determine a scale factor which primarily reflects the concentration of total ions in the extracellular space (ECS). Animal experiments verify that the proposed method recovers the anisotropic conductivity tensor which can visualize electrical properties during EBS of the brain. A direct reconstruction method for the apparent anisotropic conductivity tensor imaging during EBS was proposed to analyze unknown effects to brain tissue.","First-principles study of thermal expansion and thermomechanics of group-V monolayers: blue phosphorene, arsenene, and antimonene.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523811,Journal of physics.

In such a state, both electric and chiral superconducting currents are absent. This is in contrast to the superconducting states with the spins of Cooper pairs normal to the field, which support a nonzero chiral current and are inhibited by the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field.

The most severe artifacts-the gradient artifact and the pulse artifact-are repetitive. Average artifact subtraction (AAS) technique exploits the repetitiveness and is presumably the most often used artifact reduction technique. In this method artifact templates are calculated by averaging over adjacent artifact epochs and subsequently the templates are subtracted to reduce the artifacts. Although the AAS technique is one of the best performing methods, artifact residuals are usually present in the resulting EEG after applying the AAS technique.

The expression of Notch2 and Sox2 during extensive-passage, low-oxygen culture and differentiation conditions were analyzed to confirm that the presence of these signature proteins directly correlates with the ability of NSCs to form new neurospheres and differentiate into multiple cell types. Using expression of Notch1, Notch2 and Sox2 as a reference, we then used flow cytometry to identify a specific morphological profile for undifferentiated murine and human NSCs.

We show that ablation of the transcription factor Foxp1 in the mammary gland profoundly impairs ductal morphogenesis, resulting in a rudimentary tree throughout life. Foxp1-deficient glands were highly enriched for quiescent Tspan8hi MaSCs, which failed to become activated even in competitive transplantation assays, thus highlighting a cell-intrinsic defect. Foxp1 deletion also resulted in aberrant expression of basal genes in luminal cells, inferring a role in cell-fate decisions. Notably, Foxp1 was uncovered as a direct repressor of Tspan8 in basal cells, and deletion of Tspan8 rescued the defects in ductal morphogenesis elicited by Foxp1 loss. Thus, a single transcriptional regulator Foxp1 can control the exit of MaSCs from dormancy to orchestrate differentiation and development.",The Hippo Pathway Prevents YAP/TAZ-Driven Hypertranscription and Controls Neural Progenitor Number.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523785,Developmental cell,2019 03 21,"The Hippo pathway controls the activity of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators through a kinase cascade. Despite the critical role of this pathway in tissue growth and tumorigenesis, it remains unclear how YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription drives proliferation. By analyzing the effects of inactivating LATS1/2 kinases, the direct upstream inhibitors of YAP/TAZ, on mouse brain development and applying cell-number-normalized transcriptome analyses, we discovered that YAP/TAZ activation causes a global increase inÂ transcription activity, known as hypertranscription,Â and upregulates many genes associated with cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, conventionalÂ read-depth-normalized RNA-sequencing analysis failed to detect the scope of the transcriptome shift and missed most relevant gene ontologies. Following a transient increase in proliferation, however, hypertranscription in neural progenitors triggers replication stress, DNA damage, and p53 activation, resulting in massive apoptosis. Our findings reveal a significant impact of YAP/TAZ activation on global transcription activity and have important implications for understanding YAP/TAZ function.",Evolution of symptoms and quality of life during Zika virus infection: A 1-year prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523784,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,2018 12 07,"Although the complications of Zika virus infection have been well described, the clinical pattern has not been reported in enough detail to differentiate this infection from those with other arboviroses, and no longitudinal study has yet been published on the persistence of symptoms and quality of life.",The role of the otolaryngologist in the evaluation and management of headaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523783,American journal of otolaryngology,2019 04 03,"Headaches are commonly evaluated in otolaryngology and often represent a diagnostic dilemma.

We previously demonstrated that Tomato leaf curl Yunnan virus (TLCYnV) C4 induces plant developmental abnormalities at least partically by decreasing the accumulation of NbSKÎ·, an ortholog of Arabidopsis BIN2 kinase involved in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway, in the nucleus through directing it to the plasma membrane. However, the molecular mechanism by which the membrane-associated C4 modifies the localization of NbSKÎ· in the host cell remains unclear. Here, we show that TLCYnV C4 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein, and that C4 shuttling is accompanied by nuclear export of NbSKÎ·. TLCYnV C4 is phosphorylated by NbSKÎ· in the nucleus, which promotes myristoylation of the viral protein. Myristoylation of phosphorylated C4 favors its interaction with exportin-Î± (XPO I), which in turn facilitates nuclear export of the C4/NbSKÎ· complex. Supporting this model, chemical inhibition of N-myristoyltransferasesÂ or exportin-Î± enhanced nuclear retention of C4, and mutations of the putative phosphorylation or myristoylation sites in C4 resulted in increased nuclear retention of C4 and thus decreased severity of C4-induced developmental abnormalities. The impact of C4 on development is also lessened when a nuclear localization signalÂ or a nuclear export signalÂ is added to its C-terminus, restricting it to a specific cellular niche and therefore impairing nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Taken together, our results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TLCYnV C4, enabled by phosphorylation by NbSKÎ·, myristoylation, and interaction with exportin-Î±, is critical for its function as a pathogenicity factor.",Sae2/CtIP prevents R-loop accumulation in eukaryotic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523780,eLife,2019 05 21,"The Sae2/CtIP protein is required for efficient processing of DNA double-strand breaks that initiate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Sae2/CtIP is also important for survival of single-stranded Top1-induced lesions and CtIP is known to associate directly with transcription-associated complexes in mammalian cells. Here we investigate the role of Sae2/CtIP at single-strand lesions in budding yeast and in human cells and find that depletion of Sae2/CtIP promotes the accumulation of stalled RNA polymerase and RNA-DNA hybrids at sites of highly expressed genes. Overexpression of the RNA-DNA helicase Senataxin suppresses DNA damage sensitivity and R-loop accumulation in Sae2/CtIP-deficient cells, and a catalytic mutant of CtIP fails to complement this sensitivity, indicating a role for CtIP nuclease activity in the repair process. Based on this evidence, we propose that R-loop processing by 5' flap endonucleases is a necessary step in the stabilization and removal of nascent R-loop initiating structures in eukaryotic cells.",DNA sequence encodes the position of DNA supercoils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523779,eLife,2019 05 24,"The three-dimensional organization of DNA is increasingly understood to play a decisive role in vital cellular processes.

Here, we visualize plectonemes (extended intertwined DNA structures formed upon supercoiling) on individual DNA molecules. Remarkably, our experiments show that the DNA sequence directly encodes the structure of supercoiled DNA by pinning plectonemes at specific sequences. We develop a physical model that predicts that sequence-dependent intrinsic curvature is the key determinant of pinning strength and demonstrate this simple model provides very good agreement with the data. Analysis of several prokaryotic genomes indicates that plectonemes localize directly upstream of promoters, which we experimentally confirm for selected promotor sequences. Our findings reveal a hidden code in the genome that helps to spatially organize the chromosomal DNA."

Therefore, strategies to predict at the early phases of antibody development the risk of late-stage failure of antibody candidates are highly valuable. In this work, we employ the in silico solubility predictor CamSol to design a library of 17 variants of a humanized mAb predicted to span a broad range of solubility values, and we examine their developability potential with a battery of commonly used in vitro and in silico assays. Our results demonstrate the ability of CamSol to rationally enhance mAb developability, and provide a quantitative comparison of in vitro developability measurements with each other and with more resource-intensive solubility measurements, as well as with in silico predictors that offer a potentially faster and cheaper alternative. We observed a strong correlation between predicted and experimentally determined solubility values, as well as with measurements obtained using a panel of in vitro developability assays that probe non-specific interactions. These results indicate that computational methods have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need of carrying out laborious in vitro quality controls for large numbers of lead candidates. Overall, our study provides support to the emerging view that the implementation of in silico tools in antibody discovery campaigns can ensure rapid and early selection of antibodies with optimal developability potential.",TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) activation suppresses autophagy through inhibition of FOXO3 and impairs phagocytic capacity of microglia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523761,Autophagy,2019 06 10,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is a lysosome-dependent catabolic process for the turnover of proteins and organelles in eukaryotes. Autophagy plays an important role in immunity and inflammation, as well as metabolism and cell survival. Diverse immune and inflammatory signals induce autophagy in macrophages through pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, the physiological role of autophagy and its signaling mechanisms in microglia remain poorly understood. Microglia are phagocytic immune cells that are resident in the central nervous system and share many characteristics with macrophages. Here, we show that autophagic flux and expression of autophagy-related (Atg) genes in microglia are significantly suppressed upon TLR4 activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in contrast to their stimulation by LPS in macrophages. Metabolomics analysis of the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and its 3-phosphorylated form, PtdIns3P, in combination with bioinformatics prediction, revealed an LPS-induced reduction in the synthesis of PtdIns and PtdIns3P in microglia but not macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K, but not MTOR or MAPK1/3, restored autophagic flux with concomitant dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3. A constitutively active form of FOXO3 also induced autophagy, suggesting FOXO3 as a downstream target of the PI3K pathway for autophagy inhibition. LPS treatment impaired phagocytic capacity of microglia, including MAP1LC3B/LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and amyloid Î² (AÎ²) clearance. PI3K inhibition restored LAP and degradation capacity of microglia against AÎ². These findings suggest a unique mechanism for the regulation of microglial autophagy and point to the PI3K-FOXO3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target to regulate microglial function in brain disorders.

In this study, the expressions of the macrophage marker CD68 and transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) in CRC tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of miR-34a, TGF-Î²1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CRC tumor tissues and peripheral blood macrophages were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. TGF-Î²1 levels in culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. The cell proliferation and invasion of human CRC cell lines CL187 and HCT116 were determined by MTT assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The results showed that the expression of miR-34a was downregulated whereas TGF-Î²1 and VEGF were upregulated in CRC tumor tissues and peripheral blood macrophages. TGF-Î²1 secreted by TAMs promoted the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. TGF-Î²1-mediated miR-34a downregulation contributed to the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells via upregulating VEGF. MiR-34a in vivo exerted anti-tumor effect in CRC via inhibiting VEGF expression. In conclusion, TGF-Î²1 secreted by TAMs promoted CRC proliferation and invasion through regulating miR-34a/VEGF axis."

Both the diagnosis of TBE as well as the conduction of surveillance studies are based on the demonstration of specific antibodies. For reasons of simplicity, automatization, and quick availability of test results, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are the method of choice for anti-TBE virus antibody detection. In this study, we evaluated four commercial IgG-ELISAs using 876 epidemiological plasma samples: the Enzygnost Anti-TBE/FSME Virus IgG assay (Siemens; assay 1), the Anti-FSME/TBE Virus ELISA (IgG) assay (Euroimmun; assay 2), the Anti-FSME/TBE Virus ELISA ""Vienna"" (IgG) assay (Euroimmun; assay 3), and the RIDASCREENÂ® FSME/TBE IgG EIA assay (R-Biopharm; assay 4). In total, discrepant results were observed for 37.2% of all samples. The evaluated assays significantly differed in qualitative data (pâ<â0.0001, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) and showed Spearman's rank correlation coefficients ranging between 0.88 and 0.97 for quantitative data. The degree of disagreement between the different assays was exceptionally high for samples originating from blood donors with vaccination against TBE virus. For this sample group, the proportion of positive results was considerably higher for assay 3 (52.7%) and assay 4 (57%) than for assay 1 (7.5%) and assay 2 (6.4%), respectively, indicating that assays 1 and 2 are less suitable for the detection of vaccination antibodies than assays 3 and 4. Indirect immunofluorescence testing data available for a subset of samples (nâ=â238) mostly originating from nonflavivirus-vaccinated blood donors (nâ=â234) revealed problems in both sensitivity and specificity of the evaluated assays; whereas sensitivity issues were most prominent for the Euroimmun assay, specificity concerns were most pronounced for the Euroimmun Vienna and the RIDASCREEN assays.",The impact of external facial features on the construction of facial composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523739,Ergonomics,2019 05 17,"Witnesses may construct a composite face of a perpetrator using a computerised interface. Police practitioners guide witnesses through this unusual process, the goal being to produce an identifiable image. However, any changes a perpetrator makes to their external facial-features may interfere with this process. In Experiment 1, participants constructed a composite using a holistic interface one day after target encoding. Target faces were unaltered, or had altered external-features: (i) changed hair, (ii) external-features removed or (iii) naturally-concealed external-features (hair, ears, face-shape occluded by a hooded top). These manipulations produced composites with more error-prone internal-features: participants' familiar with a target's unaltered appearance less often provided a correct name. Experiment 2 applied external-feature alterations to composites of unaltered targets; although whole-face composites contained less error-prone internal-features, identification was impaired. Experiment 3 replicated negative effects of changing target hair on construction and tested a practical solution: selectively concealing hair and eyes improved identification. Practitioner Summary: The research indicates that when a target identity disguises or changes hair, this can lead to a witness (or victim) constructing a composite that is less readily identified. We assess a practical method to overcome this forensic issue.

Background:
 Currently, the equivalence and the substitutability of two inhaled medications are mainly driven by comparability of doses, in vitro performance, therapeutic equivalence and sameness, and handling of the inhalers. The packaging configuration is usually not considered as a factor. 
Methods:
 Two capsule-based inhaled tiotropium-containing products that differ by their primary packaging configurations (blister versus bottle) were compared in terms of potential handling and resulting storage errors due to unintentional misuse. Use error scenarios were identified and investigated for both the blister-packaged tiotropium and the bottled tiotropium capsules. The impact of the air exposure resulting from the packaging interaction errors was evaluated in vitro using fine particle dose (FPD) and delivered dose. 
Results:
 Numbers of potential errors and criticality in terms of the potential effect impact on the FPD were larger for the bottled product (between 40% and 90% loss on FPD related to initial dose). The loss of FPD could significantly impact the amount of medication that can actually reach the patient's lungs. 
Conclusion:
 When considering prescribing an inhaled medication, the specifics of the packaging and the patient's abilities and situation shall be taken into account to minimize possible handling and subsequent dosing errors.",Double-Hit Gene Expression Signature Defines a Distinct Subgroup of Germinal Center B-Cell-Like Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523716,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2019 06 14,High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH) has a poor outcome after standard chemoimmunotherapy.

We previously showed that TREM2 deficiency worsened outcomes from experimental stroke and impeded phagocytosis. However, myeloid cells participating in stroke pathology include both brain resident microglia and circulating macrophages. We now clarify whether TREM2 on brain microglia or circulating macrophages contribute to its beneficial role in ischemic stroke by generating bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice. BM chimera mice from TREM2 knockout (KO) or wild type (Wt) mice were used as donor and recipient mice. Mice were subjected to experimental stroke, and neurological function and infarct volume were assessed. Mice with intact TREM2 in brain microglia showed better neurological recovery and reduced infarct volumes, compared with mice lacking microglial TREM2. Myeloid cell activation and numbers of phagocytes were decreased in mice lacking brain TREM2, compared with mice with intact brain TREM2. These results suggest that TREM2 expression is important for post-stroke recovery, and that TREM2 expression on brain resident microglia is more essential to this recovery, than that of circulating macrophages. These findings might suggest a new therapeutic target for cerebrovascular diseases.",Addressing Antimicrobial Resistance through New Medicinal and Synthetic Chemistry Strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523713,SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,2019 03 20,"Over the past century, a multitude of derivatives of structural scaffolds with established antimicrobial potential have been prepared and tested, and a variety of new scaffolds have emerged.

The prevalence of drug resistance, both in clinical and community settings, is a consequence of bacterial ingenuity in altering pathways and/or cell morphology, making it a persistent threat to human health. The fundamental ability of pathogens to survive in a multitude of habitats can be triggered by recognition of chemical signals that warn organisms of exposure to a potentially harmful environment. Host immune defenses, including reactive oxygen intermediates and antibacterial substances, are among the multitude of chemical signals that can subsequently trigger expression of phenotypes better adapted for survival in that hostile environment. Thus, resistance development appears to be unavoidable, which leads to the conclusion that developing an alternative perspective for treatment options is vital.

This approach facilitated a robust high-concentration screening of fragment compounds and the identification of a fragment that inhibits the activity of Arg II. We further confirmed binding of the fragment to the potential allosteric site of Arg II using a surface plasmon resonance assay. We concluded that the identified fragment is a promising compound that may lead to novel drugs to treat PAD, and our method for detecting the activity of Arg II can be applied to large-scale high-throughput screening to identify other structural types of Arg II inhibitors.","OCTN: A Small Transporter Subfamily with Great Relevance to Human Pathophysiology, Drug Discovery, and Diagnostics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523710,SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,2019 02 22,"OCTN is a small subfamily of membrane transport proteins that belongs to the larger SLC22 family. Two of the three members of the subfamily, namely, OCTN2 and OCTN1, are present in humans. OCTN2 plays a crucial role in the absorption of carnitine from diet and in its distribution to tissues, as demonstrated by the occurrence of severe pathologies caused by malfunctioning or altered expression of this transporter. These findings suggest avoiding a strict vegetarian diet during pregnancy and in childhood. Other roles of OCTN2 are related to the traffic of carnitine derivatives in many tissues. The role of OCTN1 is still unclear, despite the identification of some substrates such as ergothioneine, acetylcholine, and choline. Plausibly, the transporter acts on the control of inflammation and oxidative stress, even though knockout mice do not display phenotypes. A clear role of both transporters has been revealed in drug interaction and delivery. The polyspecificity of the OCTNs is at the base of the interactions with drugs. Interestingly, OCTN2 has been recently exploited in the prodrug approach and in diagnostics. A promising application derives from the localization of OCTN2 in exosomes that represent a noninvasive diagnostic tool."

These molecules exhibit strong absorption covering the region of 600-850 nm. The incorporation of the halogen atoms onto the terminal units adjusted the energy levels and light-harvesting ability of these materials. We employed the conjugated polymers J51 and PBDB-T, having middle optical energy gaps as donor together with these ArSi derivativesÂ as acceptor to study the blend film morphology and the corresponding organic photovoltaic (OPV) performances. After optimization with device engineering works, aÂ PBDB-T:ArSiID-F-based device with a power conversion efficiency up to 9.4% was achieved.

Collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra of O-fucosylated peptides cannot be sequenced by standard tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequence database search engines because O-linked glycans are highly labile in the gas phase and are effectively absent from the CID peptide fragment spectra, resulting in a large mass error. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD) preserves O-linked glycans on peptide fragments, but only a subset of tryptic peptides with low m/ z can be reliably sequenced from ETD spectra compared to CID. Accordingly, studies to date that have used MS to identify O-fucosylated TSRs have required manual interpretation of CID mass spectra even when ETD was also employed. In order to facilitate high-throughput, automatic identification of O-fucosylated peptides from CID spectra, we re-engineered the MS/MS sequence database search engine Comet and the MS data analysis suite Trans-Proteomic Pipeline to enable automated sequencing of peptides exhibiting the neutral losses characteristic of labile O-linked glycans. We used our approach to reanalyze published proteomics data from Plasmodium parasites and identified multiple glycoforms of TSR-containing proteins.",Identification of Hydroxypyrazine O-Methyltransferase Genes in Coffea arabica: A Potential Source of Methoxypyrazines That Cause Potato Taste Defect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523690,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 06,"The goal of this study is to identify Coffea arabica O-methyltransferase (OMT) genes involved in the biosynthesis of methoxypyrazines. High levels of 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) in coffee beans are associated with the potato taste defect (PTD). Among the 34 putative O-methyltransferase genes identified in the published genome of C. canephora, three genes are highly homologous to known hydroxypyrazine OMT genes. Genes of interest were amplified and sequenced from genomic DNA of single C. arabica beans grown in eight different locations, including regions with endemic PTD. Although C. arabica OMT target sequences were almost identical regardless of source location, individual beans shared numerous polymorphisms in each of the target genes. Two of the predicted C. arabica OMT enzymes were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and one enzyme shows slow yet measurable turnover of both 3-isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP) and 3-isopropyl-2- hydroxypyrazine (IPHP), supporting a possible role of the coffee plant in PTD.",Geometry Distortion and Small Polaron Binding Energy Changes with Ionic Substitution in Halide Perovskites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523689,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 04 24,"Halide perovskites have demonstrated remarkable performance in optoelectronic applications. Despite extraordinary progress, questions remain about device stability. We report an in-depth computational study of small polaron formation, electronic structure, charge density, and reorganization energies of several experimentally relevant halide perovskites using isolated clusters. Local lattice symmetry, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling are interrelated in polaron formation in these materials. To illustrate this, first-principles calculations are performed on (MA/Cs/FA)Pb(I/Br)3 and MASnI3. Across the materials studied, electron small polaron formation is manifested by Jahn-Teller-like distortions in the central octahedron, with apical PbI bonds expanding significantly more than the equatorial bonds. In contrast, hole polarons cause the central octahedron to uniformly contract. This difference in manifestation of electron and hole polaron formation can be a tool to determine what is taking place in individual systems to systematically control performance.

Therefore, a novel therapeutic method for eradicating multidrug-resistant bacteria is developed based on the light-activated alkyl free-radical generation (that is oxygen independent). According to the polydopamine-coated carboxyl graphene (PDA@CG), an initiator-loaded and pH-sensitive heat-producible hybrid of bactericides was synthesized. According to fluorescence/thermal imaging, under the low pH of the bacterial infection sites, this platform turned positively charged, which allows their accumulation in local infection site. The plasmonic heating effects of PDA@CG can make the initiator decomposed to generate alkyl radical (Râ¢) under the followed near-infrared light irradiation. As a result, oxidative stress can be elevated, DNA damages in bacteria can be caused, and finally even multidrug-resistance death can be caused under different oxygen tensions. Moreover, our bactericidal could promote wound healing in vivo and negligible toxicity in vivo and in vitro and eliminate abscess. Accordingly, this study proves that combination of oxygen-independent free-radical-based therapy along with a stimulus-responsiveness moiety not only can be used as an effective treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria infection, but also creates a use of a variety of free radicals for treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria infection wounds.",Block Junction-Functionalized All-Conjugated Donor-Acceptor Block Copolymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523687,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Junction-functionalized donor-acceptor (D-A) block copolymers (BCPs) enable spatial and electronic control over interfacial charge dynamics in excitonic devices such as solar cells. Here, we present the design, synthesis, morphology, and electronic characterization of block junction-functionalized, all-conjugated, all-crystalline D-A BCPs. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a single thienylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (Th xDPPTh x, x = 1 or 2) unit, and poly{[ N, N'-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]- alt-5,5'-(2,2'-bithiophene)} (PNDIT2) are used as donor, interfacial unit, and acceptor, respectively. Almost all C-C coupling steps are accomplished by virtue of C-H activation. Synthesis of the macroreagent H-P3HT-Th xDPPTh x, with x determining its C-H reactivity, is key to the synthesis of various BCPs of type H-P3HT-Th xDPPTh x- block-PNDIT2. Morphology is determined from a combination of calorimetry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thin-film scattering. Block copolymer crystallinity of P3HT and PNDIT2 is reduced, indicating frustrated crystallization. A long period lp is invisible from TEM, but shows up in resonant soft X-ray scattering experiments at a length scale of lp â¼ 60 nm. Photoluminescence of H-P3HT-Th xDPPTh x indicates efficient transfer of the excitation energy to the DPP chain end, but is quenched in BCP films. Transient absorption and pump-push photocurrent spectroscopies reveal geminate recombination (GR) as the main loss channel in as-prepared BCP films independent of junction functionalization. Melt annealing increases GR as a result of the low degree of crystallinity and poorly defined interfaces and additionally changes backbone orientation of PNDIT2 from face-on to edge-on. These morphological effects dominate solar cell performance and cause an insensitivity to the presence of the block junction.",DeltaMass: Automated Detection and Visualization of Mass Shifts in Proteomic Open-Search Results.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523686,Journal of proteome research,2019 02 01,"Routine identification of thousands of proteins in a single LC-MS experiment has long become the norm.

The extraction of statistical information about the modification from peptide search results requires additional effort and data processing, such as recalibration of masses and accurate detection of precursors in MS1 signals. Here we present a software tool, DeltaMass, which performs kernel-density-based estimation of observed mass shifts and allows for the detection of poorly resolved mass deltas. The software also maps observed mass shifts to known modifications from public databases such as UniMod and augments them with additionally generated possible chemical changes to the molecule. Its interactive graphical interface provides an effective option for the visual interrogation of the data and the identification of potentially interesting mass shifts or unusual artifacts for subsequent analysis.

Herein, a series of doped Mn xZr1- xO2 catalysts with oxygen vacancy were prepared by partially substituting Zr4+ in a zirconia with low-valent manganese (Mn2+). Compared with the corresponding mechanically mixed samples (MB-x) without oxygen vacancy, Mn xZr1- xO2 catalysts exhibited better toluene conversion and specific reaction rate, where the differential values were calculated to estimate the contribution of oxygen vacancy on catalytic performance. The increase in oxygen vacancy concentrations in Mn xZr1- xO2 catalysts can boost the differential values, implying the enhancement of oxygen vacancy contribution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed the contribution of oxygen vacancy, and molecular oxygen is strongly absorbed and activated on a defective Mn-doped c-ZrO2 (111) surface with oxygen vacancy rather than a perfect m-ZrO2 (-111) surface or a perfect Mn-doped c-ZrO2 (111) surface, thus resulting in the significant improvement in catalytic activity for toluene oxidation. In situ DRIFTS spectra revealed that the oxygen vacancy can alter the toluene degradation pathway and accelerate the intermediates to convert into CO2 and H2O, thus leading to a low activation energy and high specific reaction rate."

Cation exchange membranes (CEMs) and anion exchange membranes (AEMs), the two principal types of IEM, have both been employed in VRFBs. The performance of these IEMs can be influenced by the absorption of species from the electrolyte. In this study, a typical commercial CEM (Nafion 117) and AEM (FAP 450), were examined with respect to vanadium uptake, after exposure to electrolyte at different states of charge. The two types of membrane were found to behave very differently, with the AEM showing very high selectivity for VV , which resulted in a significant increase in area-specific resistivity. In contrast, the CEM absorbed VII more strongly than vanadium in other oxidation states.

This results in depression, memory loss and even death of the brain cells. Our recently developed novel optical technique, partial wave spectroscopic microscopy has nanoscale sensitivity, and hence, can detect nanoscale changes in brain tissues due to stress. In this study, we applied this technique to quantify the stress related structural changes in the corticosterone-treated mouse model of stress. Our results show that brains from corticosterone-treated mice showed higher nanoscale structural disorder in the hippocampal region as compared to the brain from normal (vehicle) mice. The increase in structural alteration correlates with the duration of the stress. We further quantified the relative changes and the spatial localization of these changes in this mouse model and found out that the maximum changes occurred nearly symmetrically in both regions of the hippocampus. The mRNA for stress-related genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor were also significantly reduced in the hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice compared to that in control mice. These results indicate that chronic corticosterone treatment induces nanoscale structural alterations in mouse brain that corresponds to changes in stress-related gene expression.","Initiation of advance care planning in newly admitted nursing home residents in Flanders, Belgium: A prospective cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523667,Geriatrics & gerontology international,2019 06 14,"To describe (i) the timing of initiation of advance care planning (ACP) after nursing home admission; (ii) the association of dementia and physical health with ACP initiation; and (iii) if and how analgesic use and use of lipid modifying agents is related to ACP, in a cohort of newly admitted residents.",Narrative review of therapies for chronic enteropathies in dogs and cats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523666,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,2019 02 15,"The optimal medical treatment for chronic enteropathy (CE) in dogs and cats is controversial.

It displays high diversity and endemism, many peculiar absences, and far-flung biogeographic affinities. For example, New Caledonia is the only place on Earth with both main clades of flowering plants - the endemic Amborella and 'all the rest', and it also has the highest concentration of diversity in conifers. The discovery of Amborella's phylogenetic position led to a surge of interest in New Caledonian biogeography, and new studies are appearing at a rapid rate. This paper reviews work on the topic (mainly molecular studies) published since 2013. One current debate is focused on whether any biota survived the marine transgressions of the Paleocene and Eocene. Total submersion would imply that the entire fauna was derived by long-distance dispersal from continental areas since the Eocene, but only if no other islands (now submerged) were emergent. A review of the literature suggests there is little actual evidence in geology for complete submersion. An alternative explanation for New Caledonia's diversity is that the archipelago acted as a refugium, and that the biota avoided the extinctions that occurred in Australia. However, this is contradicted by the many groups that are anomalously absent or depauperate in New Caledonia, although represented there by a sister group. The anomalous absences, together with the unusual levels of endemism, can both be explained by vicariance at breaks in and around New Caledonia. New Caledonia has always been situated at or near a plate boundary, and its complex geological history includes the addition of new terranes (by accretion), orogeny, and rifting. New Caledonia comprises 'basement' terranes that were part of Gondwana, as well as island arc and forearc terranes that accreted to the basement after it separated from Gondwana. The regional tectonic history helps explain the regional biogeography, as well as distribution patterns within New Caledonia. These include endemics on the basement terranes (for example, the basal angiosperm, Amborella), disjunctions at the West Caledonian fault zone, and great biotic differences between Grande Terre and the Loyalty Islands."

For comparison, testicular tissue from neonatal Western crossbreed male piglets was used (WC group). Sixty days after xenografting (day 0Â =Â grafting), MS grafts had already developed seminiferous tubules containing sperm, whereas in the WC grafts, sperm first appeared on day 120.

The Mucin 1 (MUC1) heterodimeric protein has been confirmed that is overexpressed in ESCC and induced adverse outcomes. However, the detailed mechanism(s) remained challenging. So, we investigated the relationship between MUC1-C and metabolism in ESCC cells. In the results, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) was overexpressed and correlative with MUC1-C positively in ESCC tissue. Targeting MUC1-C inhibits AKT-mTORC-S6K1 signaling and blocks TIGAR translation. We found that the inhibitory effect of GO-203 on TIGAR was mediated by inhibition of AKT-mTOR-S6K1 pathway. The findings also demonstrated that the suppressive effect of GO-203 on TIGAR is related to the decrease ofÂ glutathione level, the increase of reactive oxygen species and the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane membrane potential. In xenograft tissues, GO-203 inhibited the growth of ESCC cells and lead to the low expression ofÂ transmembrane C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) and TIGAR. This evidence supports the contention that MUC1-C is significant for metabolism in ESCC and indicated that MUC1-C is a potential target for the treatment of ESCC.",International survey on the impact of parasitic infections: frequency of transmission and current mitigation strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523642,Vox sanguinis,2019 03 21,"Globally, blood safety interventions have been successful in mitigating risk of the major transfusion-transmitted (TT) viruses.

In heterobaric leaves, bundle sheath extensions (BSEs) increase photosynthetic performance (light-saturated rates of photosynthesis, Amax ) and water transport capacity (leaf hydraulic conductance, Kleaf ). However, it is not clear how BSEs affect these and other leaf developmental and physiological parameters in response to environmental conditions. The obscuravenosa (obv) mutation, found in many commercial tomato varieties, leads to absence of BSEs. We examined structural and physiological traits of tomato heterobaric and homobaric (obv) near-isogenic lines grown at two different irradiance levels. Kleaf , minor vein density, and stomatal pore area index decreased with shading in heterobaric but not in homobaric leaves, which show similarly lower values in both conditions. Homobaric plants, on the other hand, showed increased Amax , leaf intercellular air spaces, and mesophyll surface area exposed to intercellular airspace (Smes ) in comparison with heterobaric plants when both were grown in the shade.

Due to their shared transmission routes, dual infection by HIV and HBV or HIV and HCV, and triple infection by all three viruses are fairly common and affect millions of people worldwide. Whereas the immunodeficiency caused by HIV enhances the likelihood of HBV and HCV persistence, hepatotoxicity associated with anti-HIV therapy can worsen the liver diseases associated with HBV or HCV persistence. Evidence suggests HIV infection increases the risk of HBV- or HCV-associated HCC risk although the precise mechanisms of enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis remain to be fully elucidated.

The majority of MCC cases are associated with the recently discovered Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), while the remaining are caused by ultraviolet (UV) light-induced mutations from excessive sunlight exposure. The risk of developing MCC is much higher in the white population relative to all other races. Approximately 10% of all patients with MCC have some form of immunosuppression including HIV-1/AIDS, chronic inflammatory conditions, solid organ transplantation, or hematological malignancies. The age of onset of MCC is lower and the mortality is higher in immunosuppressed individuals than in immune-competent patients. It is plausible that HIV-1/AIDS predisposes to virus-positive MCC, but it should be noted that HIV-1/AIDS increases the risk for developing of UV-induced skin cancers such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma and therefore may also increase the risk for virus-negative MCC. Surgical management is considered standard of care for localized Merkel cell carcinoma with current recommendations advising a wide local excision of the lesion. Most international guidelines support the use of local adjuvant radiotherapy coupled with tumor staging to improve the frequency of cure. For advanced, metastatic, and recurrent MCC, checkpoint blockade inhibitors targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 have shown remarkable activity including durable long-term.

Although the wide use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the immune function and the longevity of HIV+ women, the incidence of cervical cancer in HIV+ women has not declined. For HIV+ women who follow routine cervical cancer screenings, their incidence of cervical cancer is comparable to that in HIV-negative women. Thus, adherence to the recommended cervical cancer screening is still critical for HIV+ women to prevent cervical cancer.

EBV latency infection proteins can mimic suppression cytokines or upregulate PD-1 on B cells to repress the cytotoxic T cells response. Many malignancies, including Hodgkin Lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas occur at a much higher frequency in EBV positive individuals than in EBV negative people during the development of HIV infection.

HAART has significantly impacted the incidence, management, and prognosis of AIDS-related malignancies. In addition to changing the natural history of HIV infection in regard to incidence and survival, HAART has dramatically decreased the incidence of certain virally mediated HIV-associated malignancies such as KS and primary CNS lymphoma. The beneficial effects of HAART on these tumors are attributed to drug-mediated HIV suppression and immune reconstitution. However, HAART has had a less favorable impact on EBV- and HPV-related malignancies.

The cell-free extract (CFE) of the strain F-10 was shown to inhibit the growth of all pathogens tested, while no inhibition was observed when CFE was neutralized. The strain displayed no hemolysis and exhibited a strong auto-aggregating phenotype (51.48âÂ±â1.45%, 5Â h) as well as co-aggregation. Antibiotic resistance profile was found to be safe according to the European Food Safety Authority. Biofilm formation was measured by crystal violet assay and visualized with scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. One hundred percent reduction in biofilm formation of all pathogens tested was obtained by sub-MIC value (12.5Â mg/ml) of CFE following 24-h co-incubation. Inhibition of quorum sensing-controlled virulence factors (motility, protease and elastase activity, production of pyocyanin and rhamnolipid) of P. aeruginosa strains was also observed.

However, the molecular mechanism of miR-374a in osteosarcoma (OS) cells remains unclear. The aim of our research was to investigate the role of miR-374a in OS cells migration and clarify the potential mechanisms. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis were applied to evaluate the expression of miR-374a and Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1). Bioinformatical methods and luciferase reporter assay were carried out to predict and confirm the combination of miR-374a and WIF-1. Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to detect the migration capacity of OS cells. Lithium chloride (LiCl) was used to investigate the role of LiCl-activated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway in regulating cell migration. Our studies revealed that miR-374a was up-regulated whereas WIF-1 was down-regulated in OS cells. Besides, WIF-1 was the target of miR-374a by performing luciferase reporter assay. By transfection of miR-374a inhibitor and/or WIF-1 siRNA to OS cells, we found that miR-374a promoted the migration of OS cells. In addition, the inhibition of WIF-1 abolished the miR-374a inhibitor-induced migration suppression of OS cells. LiCl experiment revealed that miR-374a promoted OS cells migration by regulating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.

Anatomically arterioles are surrounded by a monolayer of spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells (myocytes), while terminal branches of precapillary arterioles, capillaries and all sections of postcapillary venules are surrounded by a monolayer of morphologically different perivascular cells (pericytes). Pericytes are essential components of the microvascular vessel wall. Wrapped around endothelial cells, they occupy a strategic position at the interface between the circulating blood and the interstitial space. There are physiological differences in the responses of pericytes and myocytes to vasoactive molecules, which suggest that these two types of vascular cells could have different functional roles in the regulation of local blood flow within the same microvascular bed. Also, pericytes may play different roles in different microcirculatory beds to meet the characteristics of individual organs. Contractile activity of pericytes and myocytes is controlled by changes of cytosolic free Ca2+concentration. In this chapter, we attempt to summarize the results in the field of Ca2+ signalling in pericytes especially in light of their contractile roles in different tissues and organs. We investigate the literature and describe our results regarding sources of Ca2+, relative importance and mechanisms of Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry in control of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the Ca2+ signals in pericytes, where possible Ca2+ signalling and contractile responses in pericytes are compared to those of myocytes."

To do so, we microinjected saline solution or QUIN in the striatum of wild-type (nNOS +/+), heterozygote (nNOS+/-), and knock-out (nNOS-/-) mice, and measured circling behavior, GABA content levels, oxidative stress, and NOS expression and activity. We found that the absence of nNOS provides a protection against striatal oxidative damage induced by QUIN, resulting in decreased circling behavior, oxidative stress, and a partial protection reflected in GABA depletion. We have shown that nNOS-derived NO is involved in neurological damage induced by oxidative stress in a QUIN-excitotoxic model.",Diabetes and Alzheimer's Disease: A Link not as Simple as it Seems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523576,Neurochemical research,2019 06 13,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk to develop Alzheimer disease, however, the underlying mechanisms for this association are still unclear.

Moreover, the intensity of infection of mesenteric lymph nodes was compared based on gross appearance and the morphological changes in these nodes. In addition, the effects of age, sex, and season on the prevalence of Linguatula serrata were assessed. In this study, mesenteric lymph nodes (nâ=â16,284) were randomly collected from 2132 goats slaughtered in the abattoir of Tabriz, Iran, from September 2013 to September 2017. The samples were categorized based on their gross appearance (color and consistency) and then were cut into small pieces and immersed in normal saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and left for 5 to 6Â h to allow nymphs to come out from the tissue. The results showed that 1241 out of total 2132 (58. 2%) goats and 9282 out of total 16,284 mesenteric lymph nodes (57%) were infested with the nymphal stage of Linguatula serrata. It was also revealed that the infestation rate was age-dependent: as the goats grow older, the infestation increases. Further, the prevalence of Linguatula serrata nymphs in the mesenteric lymph nodes in various seasons was not significant (Pâ>â0.05). The prevalence of infestation rate in female goats was significantly higher than of male goats (Pâ<â0.05). Besides, the infestation rate in the black-colored lymph nodes (75.88%) was significantly (Pâ<â0.05) higher than those of hemorrhagic nodes (54.94%) and normal-colored nodes (22.65%). Moreover, the infestation rate of nymphs in the soft lymph nodes (83.91%) was significantly (Pâ<â0.05) higher than those in normal (21.85%) and hard (32.43%) lymph nodes. Given the fact that the Linguatula serrata is a zoonotic parasite; thus, the inspection process should be meticulously done in an abattoir, especially in areas where residents consume raw or under-cooked liver and/or visceral organs of herbivores.",Contingency awareness as a prerequisite for differential contextual fear conditioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523574,"Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",2018 12 07,"Contingency awareness during conditioning describes the phenomenon of becoming consciously aware of the association between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US). Despite the fact that contingency awareness is necessary for associative learning in some conditioning paradigms, its role in contextual fear conditioning, a variant that uses a context-CS (CTX) instead of a cue, has not been characterized thus far. We investigated if contingency awareness is a prerequisite for contextual fear conditioning and if subjects classified as aware differ from unaware subjects on a hemodynamic, autonomic, and behavioral level. We used a computer-generated picture context as CTX and slightly painful electric stimulation as US while we recorded brain responses by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and obtained skin conductance responses (SCR) and verbal ratings of emotional valence and arousal. SCR analyses revealed that only aware subjects became conditioned to the US-associated CTX (CTX+). Brain activity related to the CTX+ was more strongly pronounced in fear-associated areas like the insula in the aware relative to the unaware group. Finally, the hippocampus was functionally connected to the cingulate cortex and posterior medial frontal gyrus in aware subjects relative to unaware subjects. These task-related differential connectivity patterns suggest that information exchange between the hippocampus and regions involved in the expression of conditioned fear and decision uncertainty is crucial for the acquisition of contingency knowledge. This study demonstrates the importance of contingency awareness for contextual fear conditioning and points to the hippocampus as a potential mediator for contingency learning in contextual learning.",The Effect of Mercury Chloride and Boric Acid on Rat Erythrocyte Enzymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523573,Biological trace element research,2018 12 07,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mercury chloride and boric acid on rat (Wistar albino) erythrocyte: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphoglucona-te dehydrogenase (6PGD), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes in vivo, and the rat erythrocyte G6PD enzyme in vitro. In the in vivo study, 24 male rats were divated into three different groups: control (C), mercury chloride (M), and mercury chlorideâ+âboric acid (Mâ+âBA). At the completion of this study, a significant degree of inhibition for both G6PD and GST enzyme activity was observed in the M groups when compared to the C group (pâ<â0.05), and no significant effect was observed in the 6PGD enzyme. However, there was significantly increased TrxR and GR enzyme activity of both the M and Mâ+âBA groups (pâ<â0.05). In the in vitro study, the G6PD enzyme from rat erythrocytes was purified with 2',5'-ADP Sepharose-4B affinity chromatography, and the effect of both mercury chloride and boric acid on the enzyme activity was investigated. The results showed that boric acid increased the G6PD enzyme activity while the mercury ions that inhibited the enzyme activity (IC50 values of 346Â Î¼M and Ki values of 387Â Î¼M) were noncompetitive.",Selenium Attenuates Staphylococcus aureus Mastitis in Mice by Inhibiting the Activation of the NALP3 Inflammasome and NF-ÎºB/MAPK Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523572,Biological trace element research,2018 12 07,"Mastitis is one of the most important diseases affecting the dairy industry in the world, and it also poses a great threat to human food safety. In this study, we explored whether selenium can inhibit the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome and NF-ÎºB/MAPK pathway to achieve anti-inflammatory effects. Sixty BALB/c female mice were randomly divided into three groups according to diets of different selenium concentrations (high, normal, and low). After 90Â days, mice fed the same selenium concentration were randomly divided into two smaller groups, one of which was inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and the other injected with saline as a control. Through histopathologic examination staining, western blot, qPCR, and ELISA, the results showed that with increasing selenium concentrations, the expression levels of IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, NALP3, caspase-1, and ASC were decreased in mouse mammary tissue. Therefore, this study revealed that selenium can attenuate S. aureus mastitis by inhibiting the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome and NF-ÎºB/MAPK pathway.",An Antagonism Joint Action of Lead and Di-2-Ethylhexyl Phthalate Explains an Improved Ability of Learning and Memory after Combined Exposure in Weaning Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523571,Biological trace element research,2018 12 07,"Lead and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) are widely distributed in the environment, and their neurotoxicity has caused a widespread concern. The complexity of environmental exposure provides the possibility of their combined exposure. The present study aims to describe a joint neurotoxicity and clarify the potential mechanism after combined exposure to lead and DEHP. A 2âÃâ3 factorial design was used to analyze either single effects or their interaction by a subchronic lead and DEHP exposure model of the male weaning rats. Similar to the previous study, lead or DEHP single exposure showed an increased neurotoxicity. Interestingly, our neurobehavioral test showed the rats in the combined exposure groups had a better ability of learning and memory compared with the single-exposure ones. It seemed to reflect an antagonism joint action in neurotoxicity after combined exposure. The content of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in serum and the mRNA level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in the hippocampus showed a similar trend to the ability of learning and memory. However, there was insufficient evidence to support the joint action on some indexes of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde (MDA), the ratio of reduced glutathione(GSH) to oxidized glutathione(GSSG), Î³glutamylcysteine synthetase (Î³-GCS), glutathione-s transferase (GST), and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA expression in the hippocampus. In a word, our current study reminded a unique antagonism joint action of neurotoxicity after combined exposure to lead and DEHP, which may contribute to understanding some shallow mechanism of the joint toxicity due to the complexity of environmental pollutant exposure.","Gas-Phase Dynamics of Collision Induced Unfolding, Collision Induced Dissociation, and Electron Transfer Dissociation-Activated Polymer Ions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523570,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,2019 04 06,"Polymer characterizations are often performed using mass spectrometry (MS). Aside from MS and different tandem MS (MS/MS) techniques, ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has been recently added to the inventory of characterization technique. However, only few studies have focused on the reproducibility and robustness of polymer IM-MS analyses. Here, we perform collisional and electron-mediated activation of polymer ions before measuring IM drift times, collision cross-sections (CCS), or reduced ion mobilities (K0). The resulting IM behavior of different activated product ions is then compared to non-activated native intact polymer ions. First, we analyzed collision induced unfolding (CIU) of precursor ions to test the robustness of polymer ion shapes. Then, we focused on fragmentation product ions to test for shape retentions from the precursor ions: cation ejection species (CES) and product ions with m/z and charge state values identical to native intact polymer ions. The CES species are formed using both collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD, formally ETnoD) experiments. Only small drift time, CCS, or K0 deviations between the activated/formed ions are observed compared to the native intact polymer ions. The polymer ion shapes seem to depend solely on their mass and charge state. The experiments were performed on three synthetic homopolymers: poly(ethoxy phosphate) (PEtP), poly(2-n-propyl-2-oxazoline) (Pn-PrOx), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). These results confirm the robustness of polymer ion CCSs for IM calibration, especially singly charged polymer ions. The results are also discussed in the context of polymer analyses, CCS predictions, and probing ion-drift gas interaction potentials. Graphical Abstract."

The experimental mice were randomly divided into control, model, omeprazole (20Â mg/kg, orally) and ARA (10, 20 and 40Â mg/kg, orally). Gastric ulcer in mice was induced by intragastric administration of 80% ethanol (10Â mL/kg) containing 15Â mg/mL aspirin 4Â h after drug administration on day 7. The results indicated that ARA could significantly raise gastric juice volume and acidity; ameliorate gastric mucosal blood flow, gastric binding mucus volume, ulcer index and ulcer inhibition rate; suppress H+/K+-ATPase activity, which was confirmed by computer-aided docking simulations; inhibit the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm; inhibit caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities and down-regulate mRNA expression levels; down-regulate the mRNA and protein expressions of apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 and protein expression of cleaved poly(ADP ribose) polymerase-1; and up-regulate Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expressions and down-regulate Bax mRNA and protein expressions, thus elevating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in a dose-dependent manner.

This is based on a commonly accepted hypothesis which state that non-Newtonian effects can be neglected in intracranial blood flow. This study aims to examine the validity of such hypothesis to guide future CFD studies of intracranial hemodynamics. Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) measurements of systolic and diastolic vessel diameter and blood velocity were conducted on 16 subjects (mean age 50.6). The measurements were conducted on the internal carotid (ICA), middle cerebral (MCA), and anterior communicating (AComA) arteries. Systolic and diastolic wall shear stress (WSS) values were calculated via the Hagen-Poiseuille exact solution using Newtonian and three different non-Newtonian models: namely Carreau, power-law and Herschel-Bulkley models. The Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch correction for blood shear-thinning viscosity was applied to the non-Newtonian models. The error percentage between the two sets of models was calculated and discussed. The Newtonian hypothesis was tested statistically and discussed using paired t tests. Significant differences (Pâ<â0.0001) were found between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian WSS in ICA. In MCA and AComA, similar differences were found except in the systole and diastole for the Herschel-Bulkley and power-law models (Pâ=â0.0669, Pâ=â0.7298), respectively. The error between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian models ranged from -Â 27 to 30% (0.2 to 2.2Â Pa). These values could affect the physical interpretation of IA CFD studies.

Very little information is available on recycling and reutilization of construction and demolition waste used as the pore foaming agent in manufacturing lightweight brick. In this research, the mineral swelling agent was gypsum board recycled from construction and demolition waste. The mineral swelling agent effect on the characteristics of green lightweight building materials sintered from drinking water purification (DWP) sludge was investigated. Green lightweight building materials were contained up to 50% (wt%) mineral swelling agent and fired at a temperature ranged between 950Â Â°C and 1050 Â°C. The experimental results indicated that lightweight building materials have successfully sintered between 1000 Â°C and 1020 Â°C and added up to 40% (wt%) recycled gypsum board. The sintered building materials have the characteristics of relatively high compressive strength, low bulk density, and thermal conductivity that were in compliance with relevant Taiwan criteria for application in lightweight building materials. To further consider the eco-friendly and environmental safety of lightweight building materials, the recycled gypsum board can act as a good mineral swelling agent, but can also enhance the chemical stabilization and reduce the metals leachability of lightweight materials based on acidic neutralization capacity (ANC) analysis results. To estimate the carbon dioxide emission in manufacturing and transportation of lightweight materials that sintered this experimental conditions, the estimated carbon dioxide reduction rates were approximately 28.6% and 16.7%, respectively, as a result of the energy saving. Experimental results have confirmed that the feasibility of recycled gypsum board used as a swelling agent and good potential for construction works in green lightweight building materials.",Bisphenol S exposure affects gene expression related to intestinal glucose absorption and glucose metabolism in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523531,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 25,"Bisphenol S, an industrial chemical, has raised concerns for both human and ecosystem health. Yet, health hazards posed by bisphenol S (BPS) exposure remain poorly studied. Compared to all tissues, the intestine and the liver are among the most affected by environmental endocrine disruptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular effect of BPS on gene expression implicated in the control of glucose metabolism in the intestine (apelin and its receptor APJ, SGLT1, GLUT2) and in the liver (glycogenolysis and/or gluconeogenesis key enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)) and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-Î± and IL-1Î²)). BPS at 25, 50, and 100Â Î¼g/kg was administered to mice in water drink for 10Â weeks. In the duodenum, BPS exposure reduces significantly mRNA expression of sodium glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), apelin, and APJ mRNA. In the liver, BPS exposure increases the expression of G6Pase and PEPCK, but does not affect pro-inflammatory markers. These data suggest that alteration of apelinergic system and glucose transporters expression could contribute to a disruption of intestinal glucose absorption, and that BPS stimulates glycogenolysis and/or gluconeogenesis in the liver. Collectively, we reveal that BPS heightens the risk of metabolic syndrome.","Concentrations and chemical fractions of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb at ten metallurgical sites in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523530,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 25,"Metal pollution in urban soils due to smelting and electroplating has become a severe problem in China. In this study, the concentration, chemical fraction, and leaching behavior of typical metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) in soil samples from ten metallurgical sites were studied. The results show that some of the soils were polluted with Cu and most were heavily polluted with multiple metals, especially Zn, Cd, and Pb. The average concentration of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb was 498, 4145, 89, and 5091Â mg/kg, respectively. Chemical fractionation revealed that Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb were mainly present in the acid-soluble fraction in polluted soils, but predominated in the residual fraction in unpolluted soils, demonstrating that allogenic metals in the soils were mostly present in the more labile fractions. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure results were in agreement with the chemical fractionation study, indicating that the higher the total metal content, the higher the leachability, mobility, bioavailability, and potential toxicity to the environment, especially groundwater. Use of chemical fractionation results instead of total metal concentrations would provide better insight into the distribution and binding forms of metals for better assessment of their mobility and bioavailability. The study would provide much more important information for developing better remediation strategies for contaminated sites.",Application of carotenoid to alleviate the oxidative stress caused by phenanthrene in wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523529,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 25,"It is reported that the accumulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can cause wheat leaf chlorosis, and we identified that carotenoid (Car) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are the two most active factors in antioxidant system in the previous study. Herein, we applied Car as an exogenous chemical added to alleviate the toxicity triggered by phenanthrene (a model PAH) in wheat seedlings. In the exogenous Car addition groups, we found that the leaf number would grow three, and the relative biomass and the relative root length of 20Â mg L-1 Car added would take positive changes that increased by 171.35% and 108.08% of the phenanthrene-treated group at day 9, respectively. Under the subcellular structure, vacuole would be clear and clean, chloroplast and mitochondria shapes turned normal in the exogenous Car addition groups, and their osmophilic particle densities were much lower than the phenanthrene-treated group. Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll concentrations also recovered after Car was added in the phenanthrene treatments for 9Â days. The activity of SOD, another active factor, also decreased when Car was added, and the values dropped to 16.54 and 24.61Â UÂ g-1 for the 10 and 20 mg L-1 Car addition groups, respectively. Like the SOD activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations of the two Car addition groups decreased to 26.50% and 26.87% of the phenanthrene treatment. The relative concentrations of 5 kinds of amino acids (valine, alanine, proline, aspartic acid, and lysine) recovered significantly, and the principal component analysis suggested that amino acid concentrations were in recovery progress when Car was added in phenanthrene treatments. Therefore, it is concluded that Car is an effective PAH toxicity relief. Our result offers a new way to improve the plant resistance to PAH pollution in the environment.

Threshold analyses were employed to investigate the nonlinear relationships based on the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) framework using a balanced panel dataset of 29 provinces of China over the period of 1998-2014. The common correlated effects mean group estimator (CCEMG) was used to address time-series cross-section (TSCS) issues. The results confirmed the existence of the nonlinear relationship between urbanization and REC in China. The impact of urbanization on REC varied at different economic development levels and urbanization levels. Specifically, urbanization decreased REC at the stage that per capita disposable income of urban residents (PDI) less than 2615 USD, while it increased REC at the stage that PDI higher than 2615 USD. Similarly, urbanization decreased REC at the stage that urbanization rate lower than 55.31% and increased REC after urbanization rate exceeded 55.31%. This study did not find evidence to support the urban environmental transition theory, indicating there was still no region in China had stepped into the win-win stage of urbanization and energy consumption. Furthermore, the nonlinear impact of urban density on REC was estimated and the results indicated that urban density exerted a positive effect on REC when urban density was lower than 808 inhabitants per square kilometer, while it was no longer relevant to REC after that threshold point. Based on these results, the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions to achieve low-carbon urbanization were put forward.",The protective effects of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) scale collagen hydrolysate against oxidative stress induced by tributyltin in HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523527,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 25,"Oxidative stress is regarded as one of the most important factors associated with many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and diabetes. Various chemicals are released into the environment, causing environmental pollution. Importantly, many of them may cause damage to organisms through oxidative stress. In this work, we investigated the possible protective effects of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) scale collagen hydrolysate (TSCH) (molecular weight approximately 4Â kDa) against tributyltin (TBT)-induced oxidative stress in vitro. The results showed that pretreatment with TSCH protected against decreases in cell viability and changes in cell morphology in HepG2 cells exposed to TBT. Treatment with TSCH reduced the TBT-induced elevation in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with TSCH increased glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, TSCH decreased the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, reducing apoptosis. These results suggest that the protective mechanism of TSCH may be associated with its ability to scavenge MDA, increase antioxidant enzyme activity and downregulate the expression of Bax.",Synthesis and applications of nano-TiO2: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523526,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 18,"TiO2-based nanomaterials have attracted prodigious attention as a photocatalysts in numerous fields of applications. In this thematic issue, the mechanism behind the photocatalytic activity of nano-TiO2 as well as the critical properties have been reviewed in details. The synthesis routes and the variables that affect the size and crystallinity of nano-TiO2 have also been discussed in detail. Moreover, a newly emerged class of color TiO2, TiO2 in aerogel form, nanotubes form, doped and undoped form, and other forms of TiO2 have been discussed in details. Photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications and the type of nano-TiO2 that is more suitable for these applications have been discussed in this review.","Comparative toxicity of a food additive TiO2, a bulk TiO2, and a nano-sized P25 to a model organism the nematode C. elegans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523524,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 18,"To help fill the knowledge gap regarding the potential human health impacts of food pigment TiO2, a comparative toxicity study was performed on a food-grade TiO2 (f-TiO2), a bulk TiO2 (b-TiO2), and a nano-sized TiO2 (Degussa P25), and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Acute phototoxicity and chronic toxicity effects including reproduction, lifespan, and vulval integrity were evaluated. The f-TiO2, b-TiO2, and P25 had a primary particle size (size range) of 149 (53-308) nm, 129 (64-259) nm, and 26 (11-52) nm, respectively. P25 showed the greatest phototoxicity with a 24-h LC50 of 6.0Â mg/L (95% CI 5.95, 6.3), followed by the f-TiO2 (LC50â=â6.55Â mg/L (95% CI 6.35, 6.75)), and b-TiO2 was the least toxic. All three TiO2 (1-10Â mg/L) induced concentration-dependent effects on the worm's reproduction, with a reduction in brood size by 8.5 to 34%. They all caused a reduction of worm lifespan, accompanied by an increased frequency of age-associated vulval integrity defects (Avid). The impact on lifespan and Avid phenotype was more notable for P25 than the f-TiO2 or b-TiO2. Ingestion and accumulation of TiO2 particles in the worm intestine was observed for all three materials by light microscopy. These findings demonstrate that the food pigment TiO2 induces toxicity effects in the worm and further studies are needed to elucidate the human health implication of such toxicities.",Progress in Developing Pharmacologic Agents to Treat Bulimia Nervosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523523,CNS drugs,2019 01 22,"This paper reviews past and current progress in developing pharmacologic agents for the treatment of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN). We searched the literature and clinical trial registries for compounds studied in BN, the related condition, binge eating disorder (BED), and preclinical models of binge-eating behavior. Drug classes evaluated included antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, stimulants and other medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, opioid antagonists, and weight loss agents, among others. The only available drugs with established efficacy in BN at this time include antidepressants (especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) and the antiepileptic topiramate, though the efficacy of these compounds is modest at best. The only medications we found currently receiving empirical study in people with BN were fluoxetine, other serotonergic antidepressants, intranasal naloxone, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, phentermine-topiramate combination, the antiandrogenic oral contraceptive ethinyl estradiol plus drospirenone, and prazosin. Preclinical models suggest that nociceptin receptor antagonists, the selective serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonist lorcaserin, monoamine stabilizers, and selective orexin-1 receptor antagonists might be helpful. We found no evidence of a drug developed specifically for the treatment of individuals with BN. Future areas for research in the pharmacotherapy of BN are suggested. Importantly, until drugs are developed specifically for eating disorders, drugs developed for other conditions that are centrally acting and associated with beneficial psychotropic effects and/or reduced appetite or weight loss might be considered for repurposing in BN."

Imatinib, a potent inhibitor of mutated KIT, has revolutionized the clinical management of advanced, metastatic GIST. However, secondary resistance develops mainly through acquired mutations in KIT exons 13/14 or exons 17/18. Second-line sunitinib potently inhibits KIT exon 13/14 mutants but is ineffective against exon 17 mutations. In our study, PLX9486 demonstrated in vitro nanomolar potency in inhibiting the growth and KIT phosphorylation of engineered BaF3 cells transformed with KIT exon 17 mutations (p.D816V) and with the double KIT exon 11/17 mutations (p.V560G/D816V). The in vivo efficacy of PLX9486 was evaluated using two imatinib-resistant GIST patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. In UZLX-GIST9 (KIT: p.P577del;W557LfsX5;D820G), PLX9486 100Â mg/kg/day resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed a pronounced reduction in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and other downstream effects of the KIT signaling pathway but no significant effect on KIT Y703 and Y719 phosphorylation. Similarly, in MRL-GIST1 (KIT: p.W557_K558del;Y823D) PLX9486 treatment led to significant tumor regression and strong inhibition of MAPK activation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect on MAPK activation was evident even after a single dose of PLX9486. In conclusion, PLX9486 showed anti-tumor efficacy in patient-derived imatinib-resistant GIST xenograft models, mainly through inhibition of KIT signaling. These preclinical efficacy data encourage further testing of PLX9486 in the clinical setting.",Lost in Datafication? - A Typology of (Emotion) Data Contextualization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523506,Integrative psychological & behavioral science,2018 12 07,"This article elaborates on the meaning of ""context"" for data created in interdisciplinary research on emotions. Particularly with regard to the potential reuse of scientific data, the elicitation of contexts can contribute to a better assessment of emotion data. Beyond a discussion of social scientific conceptualizations of ""context"" focusing on the situational and cultural contexts and their respective interrelations, this article presents the findings of an empirical study on datafication processes in interdisciplinary emotion research. Based on 123 survey responses and 15 in-depth interviews, a multitude of contextual dimensions will be reviewed. The typology of contexts, ranging from method-specific aspects and researchers' subjectivities to the contextual embeddedness of the research objects, provides a schema suitable for various epistemological approaches. The proposed typology can serve as a framework for emotion researchers to reflect on their research practice and interactions with research participants. The empirical findings also show the limitations of contextualization pertaining to tacit knowledge, implicit knowledge, embodied emotions and ethical considerations. The article concludes with suggestions for further research, pointing to intercultural settings, the integration of contexts and particular scenarios for data reuse.",Propagation of Extrinsic Fluctuations in Biochemical Birth-Death Processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523505,Bulletin of mathematical biology,2019 02 06,"Biochemical reactions are often subject to a complex fluctuating environment, which means that the corresponding reaction rates may themselves be time-varying and stochastic. If the environmental noise is common to a population of downstream processes, then the resulting rate fluctuations will induce statistical correlations between them. In this paper we investigate how such correlations depend on the form of environmental noise by considering a simple birth-death process with dynamical disorder in the birth rate. In particular, we derive expressions for the second-order statistics of two birth-death processes evolving in the same noisy environment. We find that these statistics not only depend on the second-order statistics of the environment, but the full generator of the process describing it, thus providing useful information about the environment. We illustrate our theory by considering applications to stochastic gene transcription and cell sensing.",Do ultraviolet photos increase sun safe behavior expectations via fear? A randomized controlled trial in a sample of U.S. adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523504,Journal of behavioral medicine,2019 05 21,"Ultraviolet (UV) photos reveal the world in a different light spectrum, including damage that is caused by UV light. In the context of skin cancer control, UV photos have the potential to communicate fear because they reveal underlying skin damage. U.S. adults (Nâ=â2219) were assigned to a 5 (visual: UV skin damage, sun exposure, sunburn, photoaging, and mole removal)âÃâ3 (replication: three examples of each visual condition)âÃâ4 (efficacy: no efficacy, text only, visual, visualâ+âtext) randomized controlled trial. Compared to all other visual conditions combined, UV skin damage visuals generated greater fear which triggered increased sun safe behavior expectations. Compared with other visual conditions separately, only mole removal visuals produced equivalent fear as UV skin damage visuals. Visual efficacy conditions appeared to nullify rather than magnify the indirect path through fear. The results suggest one way UV images impact sun safe behavioral expectations is via fear and that researchers should continue to examine the position of fear in fear appeal theories.",Social support buffers the negative effects of stress in cardiac patients: a cross-sectional study with acute coronary syndrome patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523503,Journal of behavioral medicine,2019 06 10,"Cardiac patients who have social support generally have better prognosis than patients who lack social support. Several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this protective effect, including the capacity of social support to buffer the negative effects of stress. We tested this buffering effect in a study of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Spain. Several days after the cardiac event patients answered a questionnaire measuring stressful events during their lifetime, perceived social support around the time of the cardiac event, and depression symptoms in the past week. Results showed that stressful life events were related to depressive symptoms and worse renal function post-ACS only among patients with low perceived social support. Among patients who reported enough social support, lifetime stress was not related to depressive symptoms. No similar effects were observed on other prognostic indicators such as troponin levels or the number of obstructed arteries. These results suggest that social support can buffer the negative effects of stress on the mental and physical well-being of cardiac patients.",Robot-assisted stereotactic brainstem biopsy in children: prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523502,Journal of robotic surgery,2018 12 07,"Tumours located within the brainstem comprise approximately a tenth of all paediatric brain tumours. Surgical biopsy of these tumours is technically challenging and has historically been associated with considerable risk. To this end, robot-assisted surgery theoretically allows for increased accuracy and precision. In this study we report our experience using the Neuromate robot (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, UK) to perform robot-assisted stereotactic biopsy in children with tumours located within the brainstem. An uncontrolled prospective cohort study was performed (phase II) according to the IDEAL model for safe surgical innovation. All cases were recorded on a prospectively maintained database. The database was searched over a 2-year period between the 1st December 2015 and the 31st November 2017 to identify all children with brainstem tumours that underwent robot-assisted stereotactic brain biopsy. When accessible, the post-operative MRI scans and pre-operative plans were compared to assess the target point localisation error (TPLE). Adverse events were recorded prospectively according to whether they resulted in increased hospital stay, caused neurological injury, or lead to death. In all, 11 consecutive children were identified with brain tumours located within the brainstem. In 10/11 cases specimens were diagnostic; in the remaining case a further biopsy was successful. The most frequent pathology was DIPG (7/15). Seven patients underwent an early post-operative volumetric MRI; the calculated median TPLE was 2.7Â mm (range 0.5-4.2Â mm). There were no surgical complications noted. Robot-assisted stereotactic biopsy in children appears to be feasible and safe. Research databases and comparative studies are warranted to further assess the technique.",Expression of Insulinoma-Associated Protein 1 (INSM1) and Orthopedia Homeobox (OTP) in Tumors with Neuroendocrine Differentiation at Rare Sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523500,Endocrine pathology,2019 03 29,"Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) and orthopedia homeobox (OTP) are transcription factors that play a critical role in neuroendocrine (NE) and neuroepithelial cell development. INSM1 has been identified in multiple tumors of NE or neuroepithelial origin, whereas OTP expression has been mainly studied in NE tumors of pulmonary origin. Expression of OTP appears to correlate with poorer prognosis in pulmonary carcinoids; however, its expression patterns in other NE/neuroepithelial tumors need further investigation. Here, we assessed the diagnostic utility of INSM1 and OTP in tumors with NE differentiation at relatively uncommon sites including prostate, breast, and tumors of gynecologic origin. Thirty-two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cases were used to construct a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry for INSM1 and OTP was performed and scored semi-quantitatively. INSM1 was diffusely expressed in 60% of gynecologic tumors, 71.4% of mammary carcinoma, and 25% of prostate adenocarcinoma with NE differentiation. Diffuse expression of OTP was detected in 50% of prostate adenocarcinoma with NE differentiation and 100% neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary. Immunostain for achaete-scute homolog 1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 supported the NE and/or neuroepithelial differentiation of the tumors. In summary, INSM1 is expressed in most of the tumors with NE and neuroepithelial differentiation in this study, confirming the diagnostic utility of INSM1 as a novel and sensitive marker of NE/neuroepithelial differentiation. The expression of OTP in some NE tumors outside of lung expands the spectrum of tumors that may express this biomarker and should be considered when working up a NE tumor of unknown primary site.",Potential value of the PixelShine deep learning algorithm for increasing quality of 70 kVp+ASiR-V reconstruction pelvic arterial phase CT images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523499,Japanese journal of radiology,2019 04 09,"To investigate the effect of a deep learning-based denoising algorithm, PixelShine (PS), on the quality of 70 kVp pelvic arterial phase CT images.",Cobalt Administration Causes Reduced Contractility with Parallel Increases in TRPC6 and TRPM7 Transporter Protein Expression in Adult Rat Hearts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523498,Cardiovascular toxicology,2019 06 10,"Exposure to circulating cobalt (Co2+) in patients with metal-on-metal orthopaedic hip implants has been linked to cardiotoxicity but the underlying mechanism(s) remain undefined. The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of Co2+ on the heart in vivo and specifically on cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. Adult male rats were treated with CoCl2 (1Â mg/kg) for either 7Â days or 28Â days. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure Co2+ uptake into various organs of the body. Co2+ accumulated in the heart over time with significant levels evident after only 7Â days of treatment. There was no evidence of cardiac remodelling following Co2+ treatment as assessed by heart weight:body weight and left ventricular weight:body weight. However, a decrease in fractional shortening, as measured using echocardiography, was observed after 28Â days of Co2+ treatment. This was accompanied by increased protein expression of the ion transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPC6 and TRPM7 as assessed by quantitative immunoblotting of whole cardiac homogenates. Uptake of Co2+ specifically into rat cardiac fibroblasts was measured over 72Â h and was shown to dramatically increase with increasing concentrations of applied CoCl2. Expression levels of TRPC6 and TRPM7 proteins were both significantly elevated in these cells following Co2+ treatment. In conclusion, Co2+ rapidly accumulates to significant levels in the heart causing compromised contractility in the absence of any overt cardiac remodelling. TRPC6 and TRPM7 expression levels are significantly altered in the heart following Co2+ treatment and this may contribute to the Co2+-induced cardiotoxicity observed over time."

The 4 P's Plus screener includes questions on perceived problematic substance use in parents and partner that are not considered in risk stratification. Objectives This research examined the: (1) prevalence of self-reported problematic parental and partner substance use and associations with biochemically-verified prenatal substance use; (2) utility of self-reported perceptions of parent/partner substance use as proxies for prenatal substance use; and (3) degree to which the sensitivity of the 4P's Plus can be augmented with consideration of parent/partner questions in risk stratification. Methods A convenience sample of 500 pregnant women was recruited between January 2017 and January 2018. Participants completed the 4P's Plus and provided urine for drug testing. Diagnostic utility of problematic parent/partner substance use questions was assessed, then compared to the 4P's Plus used as designed, and to the 4P's Plus used with these 2 questions included in risk stratification. Results Half (51%) of respondents reported either partner or parental problematic substance use. When partner or parent problematic substance use were considered as proxies for prenatal substance use, sensitivity was 65% and specificity was 55%. When used as intended, sensitivity was 94% and specificity was 29%. Including partner/parent questions increased sensitivity to 96% but lowered specificity (19%). Partner substance use and combined partner/parent use were associated with prenatal substance use [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.0 (1.2, 2.4; pâ=â0.006); aORâ=â1.6 (1.1, 2.5, pâ=â0.04)].

Carboxymethylation was used to introduce a carboxymethyl group into a starch compound. The carboxymethyl sago starch (CMSS) was used to prepare smart hydrogel by adding acetic acid into the CMSS powder as the crosslinking agent. The degree of substitution of the CMSS obtained was 0.6410. The optimization was based on the gel content and degree of swelling of the hydrogel. In this research, four parameters were studied in order to optimize the formation of CMSS-acid hydrogel. The parameters were; CMSS concentration, acetic acid concentration, reaction time and reaction temperature. From the data analyzed, 76.69% of optimum gel content was obtained with 33.77Â g/g of degree of swelling. Other than that, the swelling properties of CMSS-acid hydrogel in different media such as salt solution, different pH of phosphate buffer saline solution as well as acidic and alkaline solution were also investigated. The results showed that the CMSS-acid hydrogel swelled in both alkaline and salt solution, while in acidic or low pH solution, it tended to shrink and deswell. The production of the hydrogel as a smart material offers a lot of auspicious benefits in the future especially related to swelling behaviour and properties of the hydrogel in different types of media.",A Comparison of Evoked and Non-evoked Functional Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523480,Brain topography,2019 05 15,"The growing interest in brain networks to study the brain's function in cognition and diseases has produced an increase in methods to extract these networks. Typically, each method yields a different network. Therefore, one may ask what the resulting networks represent. To address this issue we consider electrocorticography (ECoG) data where we compare three methods. We derive networks from on-going ECoG data using two traditional methods: cross-correlation (CC) and Granger causality (GC). Next, connectivity is probed actively using single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES). We compare the overlap in connectivity between these three methods as well as their ability to reveal well-known anatomical connections in the language circuit. We find that strong connections in the CC network form more or less a subset of the SPES network. GC and SPES are related more weakly, although GC connections coincide more frequently with SPES connections compared to non-existing SPES connections. Connectivity between the two major hubs in the language circuit, Broca's and Wernicke's area, is only found in SPES networks. Our results are of interest for the use of patient-specific networks obtained from ECoG. In epilepsy research, such networks form the basis for methods that predict the effect of epilepsy surgery. For this application SPES networks are interesting as they disclose more physiological connections compared to CC and GC networks.",Atypicalities of Gesture Form and Function in Autistic Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523479,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 29,"While well-represented on clinical measures, co-speech gesture production has never been formally studied in autistic adults. Twenty-one verbally fluent autistic adults and 21 typically developing controls engaged in a controlled conversational task. Group differences were observed in both semantic/pragmatic and motoric features of spontaneously produced co-speech gestures. Autistic adults prioritized different functions of co-speech gesture. Specifically, they used gesture more than controls to facilitate conversational turn-taking, demonstrating a novel nonverbal strategy for regulating conversational dynamics. Autistic adults were more likely to gesture unilaterally than bilaterally, a motoric feature of gesture that was individually associated with autism symptoms. Co-speech gestures may provide a link between nonverbal communication symptoms and known differences in motor performance in autism.",Economic production and biocontrol efficiency of lipopeptide biosurfactants from Bacillus mojavenis A21.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523478,Biodegradation,2018 12 07,"In the wake of an increased attention on the eco-friendly biopesticidal products and the rising market requirements for organic agents, lipopeptides compounds have been described as biological control agents which improve the overall health growth and development of plants.

Test-retest reliability was assessed through intraclass correlation (ICC). Measurement error was assessed through smallest detectable change (SDC). Construct validity was assessed through six a priori hypotheses through correlation of the CD-RISC10 score with other patient-reported outcome measures. Structural validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Fit indices evaluated were root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TFI), and standardized root-mean-squared residual (SRMR). Ten patients completed the CDIs and face validity was supported. Among 108 patients (median age: 37(21-77), 81.5% males, 93.5% Chinese), the CD-RISC10 demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alphaâ=â0.94), and excellent test-retest reliability [ICCâ=â0.964 (95% CI 0.937-0.980)]. SDC was calculated as 1.88. Construct validity was established by meeting five out of the six a priori hypotheses. Structural validity was supported as CFA confirmed a one-factor model, with adequate fit statistics after adding three covariances (RMSEAâ=â0.077; CFIâ=â0.975; TLIâ=â0.964; SRMRâ=â0.036). This study supports the CD-RISC10 as a valid and reliable measure of resilience for use in patients with axSpA.",Cognitive and Emotional Profiles of CU Traits and Disruptive Behavior in Adolescence: a Prospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523475,Journal of abnormal child psychology,2019 05 12,"In this study we followed 82-90 adolescents, 50% boys, from 15 to 16Â years, investigating CU traits and disruptive behaviors as predictors of cognitive skills and arousal to emotional pictures. At age 15, CU traits were rated by adolescents and disruptive (aggregated ADHD-ODD-delinquent) behaviors were rated by parents and adolescents. At age 16, executive function, reaction time variability (RTV), IQ and arousal to negative pictures were assessed. The results showed that, with control for disruptive behaviors, CU traits predicted lower RTV, higher IQ and lower arousal to negative pictures. With control for CU traits, disruptive behaviors predicted lower spatial working memory, lower interference control and higher RTV. Our findings are of theoretical and clinical relevance as they point to highly diverging cognitive and emotional profiles of CU traits and disruptive behaviors.",Multicenter retrospective analysis of the safety and efficacy of regorafenib after progression on sorafenib in Korean patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523474,Investigational new drugs,2019 06 10,"Background The pivotal RESORCE trial showed that regorafenib was effective as second-line therapy for patients with advanced HCC who progressed on first-line sorafenib. Real-world data are needed to assess clinical outcomes and adverse events in the setting of daily practice. Methods Between April 2017 and August 2017, the Named Patient Program (NPP) was activated to provide controlled, pre-approval access of regorafenib in Korea. This analysis is a multicenter retrospective study of patients who received regorafenib under the NPP. Results A total of 49 patients entered into this NPP, and 40 patients received regorafenib in five Korean institutions. All but one patient received regorafenib as second-line therapy after progression on sorafenib, and 36 (90%) and 34 (85%) patients were classified as Child-Pugh A and BCLC stage C, respectively. The response rate was 10% (nÂ =â4). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.7Â months (95% CI, 2.5-4.9Â months), and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached. The 1Â year OS rate was 54.6%. The time-to-progression (TTP) on prior sorafenib was significantly associated with PFS and OS. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were hand-foot skin reaction (nÂ =â3, 8%), hypertension (nÂ =â2, 5%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (nÂ =â2, 5%). Conclusion Regorafenib was well-tolerated and effective in patients with advanced HCC who progressed on first-line sorafenib, with efficacy and safety outcomes consistent with those of the previous RESORCE trial. TTP on first-line sorafenib may predict the efficacy of subsequent regorafenib.",Outcomes in Peritoneal Dissemination from Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma of the Appendix Treated with Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523470,Annals of surgical oncology,2019 05 17,"Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) is standard treatment for peritoneal dissemination from appendiceal cancer (AC); however, its role in high-grade histopathologic subtypes (high-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei [HGMCP] and HGMCP with signet ring cells [HGMCP-S]) is controversial due to their aggressive behavior.

However, the high-yield preparation of recombinant MTHase has not yet been reported. In this study, a codon-optimized synthetic gene encoding Sulfolobus acidocaldarius MTHase was expressed in Escherichia coli. In initial expression experiments conducted using pET-24a (+) and E. coli BL21 (DE3), the MTHase activity was 10.4Â U/mL and a large amount of the expression product formed inclusion bodies. The familiar strategies, including addition of additives, co-expression with molecular chaperones, and expression with a fusion partner, failed to enhance soluble MTHase expression. Considering the intermolecular disulfide bond of MTHase, expression was investigated using a system comprising plasmid pET-32a (+) and host E. coli Origami (DE3), which is conducive to cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation. The MTHase activity increased to 55.0Â U/mL, a 5.3-fold increase. Optimization of the induction conditions in a 3-L fermentor showed that when the lactose was fed at 0.2Â g/L/h beginning at an OD600 of 40 and the induction temperature was maintained at 30Â Â°C, the MTHase activity reached a maximum of 204.6Â U/mL. This is the first report describing a systematic effort to obtain high-efficiency MTHase production. The high yield obtained using this process provides the basis for the industrial-scale production of trehalose. This report is also expected to be valuable in the production of other enzymes containing disulfide bonds."

It is generally accepted that members of every microbial taxon are susceptible to at least one virus, and a plethora of bacterial viruses are known.

Here, a novel lytic archaeal virus is described, designated ""Drs3"", as well as its host, Methanobacterium formicicum strain Khl10. This hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaeon and its virus were isolated from the anaerobic digester of an experimental biogas plant in Germany. The tailed virus has an icosahedral head with a diameter of approximately 60Â nm and a long non-contractile tail of approximately 230Â nm.

At a high casting temperature, the microstructure of the glass is quite homogenous and thus, internal stress cannot be generated during cycling. Therefore, the glass cannot be rejuvenated by cryogenic cycling treatment. In the contrary, by lowering the casting temperature, nano-sized heterogeneity can be induced and subsequently generates the internal stress and rejuvenates the glass. Once the glass is rejuvenated, the more induced free volume can plasticize the glass with a higher plastic strain. These findings point out that the synthesis conditions can tailor the heterogeneity of the glass and subsequently affect the following rejuvenation behavior upon thermal treatment. It can also help understand the mechanisms of rejuvenation of metallic glass upon cryogenic cycling treatment.",Seagrass litter decomposition: an additional nutrient source to shallow coastal waters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523426,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 01 29,"Seagrass ecosystems are vital for its regulatory services yet, highly threatened by degradation due to human pressures. Decomposition of two tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata and Cymodocea rotundata) was studied and compared, to understand their potential in generating additional nutrients to coastal waters. Release of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus during the decomposition process of seagrass wracks was estimated in bacteria-active (non-poisoned) and bacteria-inhibited (poisoned) conditions from shore-washed fresh seagrass, sampled from Palk Bay, India. Incubation experiments for 25Â days indicated a near three times higher concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in bacteria-inhibited flasks compared to bacteria-active conditions for both species. The maximum leaching rates of DOC, TDN and TDP were found to be 294, 65.1 and 11.2Â Î¼M/g dry wt/day, respectively. Further, higher release of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (>â1.3 times) was documented from the bacteria-active flask, highlighting the significance of microbial process in generating bio-available nutrients from decaying seagrass.

The two ligating histidines are of particular interest as they may influence the electronic and redox properties of the metal center. To test for the presence of reactive ligating histidines, a portion of cytochrome c oxidase from the bacteria Thermus thermophilus that contains the CuA site (the TtCuA protein) was treated with the chemical modifier diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and the reaction followed through UV-visible, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies at pH 5.0-9.0. A mutant protein (H40A/H117A) with the non-ligating histidines removed was similarly tested. Introduction of an electron-withdrawing DEPC-modification onto the ligating histidine 157 of TtCuA increased the reduction potential by over 70Â mV, as assessed by cyclic voltammetry. Results from both proteins indicate that DEPC reacts with one of the two ligating histidines, modification of a ligating histidine raises the reduction potential of the CuA site, and formation of the DEPC adduct is reversible at room temperature. The existence of the reactive ligating histidine suggests that this residue may play a role in modulating the electronic and redox properties of TtCuA through kinetically-controlled proton exchange with the solvent. Lack of reactivity by the metalloproteins Sco and azurin, both of which contain a mononuclear copper center, indicate that reactivity toward DEPC is not a characteristic of all ligating histidines.",Benefit of cetuximab addition to a platinum-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy according to KRAS-LCS6 variant in an unselected population of recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523411,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 10,To evaluate the benefit of cetuximab (Cx) addition to platinum-based and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy (PFU) in unselected recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer patients (R/MHNC) according to KRAS-LCS6 variant status.,Intermediate-term outcomes of our original multiple-knot technique using ePTFE sutures for anterior mitral leaflet prolapse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523410,Surgery today,2019 04 03,To define the outcomes of our original simple chordal replacement technique using ePTFE sutures for mitral regurgitation.,Effect of the botanical formula LCS101 on the anti-cancer effects of radiation therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523409,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,2019 03 07,"The botanical formula LCS101 has been shown in clinical research to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicities.

The regulatory mechanisms of Pi homeostasis in the salivary glands are unknown. We investigated how salivary Pi concentrations are regulated by dietary Pi in mouse models. Dietary manipulation significantly changed the levels of Npt2b protein in the salivary gland ductal cells. In addition, rapid feeding on a high-Pi diet increased the saliva Pi concentrations and led to rapid endocytosis of Npt2b in the apical membranes of the duct cells. Global Npt2bÂ± mice exhibited increased salivary Pi concentrations and intestine-specific deletion of Npt2b after high Pi loading increased the salivary Pi concentrations. These findings indicate that Npt2b levels in the salivary glands affect the salivary Pi concentration and are regulated by dietary Pi. Intestinal Npt2b levels might also affect salivary Pi concentrations as well as renal Pi excretion. These findings suggest Pi is endogenously recycled by salivary Pi secretion, intestinal Pi absorption, and renal Pi excretion.",Polygenic analysis suggests the involvement of calcium signaling in executive function in schizophrenia patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523404,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2018 12 07,"Cognitive deficits are increasingly recognized as a core dimension rather than a consequence of schizophrenia (SCZ). The previous evidence supports the hypothesis of shared genetic factors between SCZ and cognitive ability. The objective of this study was to test whether and to what extent the variation of disease-relevant neurocognitive function in a sample of SCZ patients from the previous clinical interventional studies can be explained by SCZ polygenic risk scores (PRSs) or by hypothesis-driven and biomedical PRSs. The previous studies have described associations of the SNAP25 gene with cognition in SCZ. Likewise, the enrichment of several calcium signaling-related gene sets has been reported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in SCZ. Hypothesis-driven PRSs were calculated on the basis of the SNAP-25 interactome and also for genes regulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of the signal transduction of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. In a cohort of 127 SCZ patients who had completed a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery as part of the previous antipsychotic intervention studies, we investigated the association between neurocognitive dimensions and PRSs. The PRS for SCZ and SNAP-25-associated genes could not explain the variance of neurocognition in this cohort. At a p value threshold of 0.05, the PRS for PMA was able to explain 2% of the variance in executive function (pâ=â0.05, uncorrected). The correlation between the PRS for PMA-regulated genes and cognition can give hints for further patient-derived cellular assays. In conclusion, incorporating biological information into PRSs and other en masse genetic analyses may help to close the gap between genetic vulnerability and the biological processes underlying neuropsychiatric diseases such as SCZ.","Exercise intensity effects on total sweat electrolyte losses and regional vs. whole-body sweat [Na+], [Cl-], and [K+].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523403,European journal of applied physiology,2019 05 29,To quantify total sweat electrolyte losses at two relative exercise intensities and determine the effect of workload on the relation between regional (REG) and whole body (WB) sweat electrolyte concentrations.

Numerous studies have demonstrated familial aggregation of nephrolithiasis and a twin study estimated the heritability to be 56%. Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies have uncovered several sequence variants that confer increased risk of common complex kidney stone disease. The firstÂ reported variants were observed at the CLDN14 locus in the Icelandic population. This finding hasÂ since beenÂ replicated in other populations. The CLDN14 gene is expressed in tight junctions of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where the protein is believed to play a role in regulation of calcium transport.

Momentum transfer and inertia: a novel view on fragmentation mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523389,Urolithiasis,2018 12 07,"Shock wave lithotripsy is the only non-invasive stone therapy and in clinical use since 1980. In spite of decades with millions of patients treated, the mechanism of fragmentation is still under debate. Detailed knowledge of the fragmentation process is required for improvements regarding safety and efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of fragmentation by drawing attention to basic physical laws of inertia and momentum transfer. Many fragmentation experiments are based on the overall efficiency of multiple shock waves in crushing kidney stones or artificial model stones utilizing small baskets or latex pouches. Due to the high dynamic nature of the fragmentation process, in vitro and in vivo, a detailed action of a single shock wave on a particular stone target is difficult to investigate. We utilized a bifilar stone suspension, which allowed us to observe horizontal movements of model stones, their return to the initial position and orientation for repeated exposure of separate identical shocks. The method does not describe the entire fragmentation process in detail but elucidates a mechanism, which may be effective throughout shock wave lithotripsy in general. Measurements on model stones in water revealed forces in the range of 370Â N, acceleration values of 100,000-200,000Â m/s2 (ââ10,000Â g) and gained momentum of 3.7âÃâ10-â4Â kg m/s we consider sufficient to break most human urinary stones. Fracture patterns of repeated identical shock waves show typical features supporting spallation (Hopkinson effect) and the mechanism of momentum transfer. Schlieren and photo-elastic images provide a visual impression of spatial stress in a transparent acrylic glass cylinder, cavitation fields outside and at the surface of the cylinder, which are compatible with the inertia model. The proposed mechanism covers coarse as well as fine fragmentation. Collapsing cavitation bubbles may have an impact on the fragmentation process but although expected, a direct action of micro-jets on sample surfaces could not be detected.",SET domains and stress: uncovering new functions for yeast Set4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523388,Current genetics,2019 05 14,"Chromatin dynamics are central to the regulation of gene expression and genome stability, particularly in the presence of environmental signals or stresses that prompt rapid reprogramming of the genome to promote survival or differentiation.

We recently identified a role for the relatively uncharacterized SET domain protein Set4 in promoting cell survival during oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Set4 is a member of the Set3 subfamily of SET domain proteins which are defined by the presence of a PHD finger and divergent SET domain sequences. Here, we integrate our new observations on the function of Set4 with known roles for other related family members, including yeast Set3, fly UpSET and mammalian proteins MLL5 and SETD5.

PD-1 blockade could potentially enhance CAR T cell function. Here, we show that mesothelin is overexpressed in human triple-negative breast cancer cells and can be targeted by CAR T cells. To overcome the suppressive effect of PD-1 on CAR T cells, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein-mediated editing to disrupt the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) gene locus in human primary T cells, resulting in a significantly reduced PD-1hi population. This reduction had little effect on CAR T cell proliferation but strongly augmented CAR T cell cytokine production and cytotoxicity towards PD-L1-expressing cancer cells in vitro.

Recent advances in research related to sphingolipid biochemistry have shed light on the importance of sphingolipids in terms of cellular signalling in health and disease. However, dihydrosphingolipids have received less attention and research is lacking especially in terms of their molecular mechanisms of action. This is despite studies implicating them in the pathophysiology of disease, for example dhCer in predicting type 2 diabetes in obese individuals, dhS1P in cardiovascular diseases and dhSph in hepato-renal toxicity.

However, its therapeutic efficacy is still limited due to the immunogenicity and poor tumor-targeting capability. In this report, an engineered oncolytic vaccinia virus (OVV) was constructed by site-specifically introducing azide groups to the envelope of OVV during the in situ assembling process of virions. Subsequently, dibenzocyclooctynes (DBCO) derivate T7 peptide and DBCO derivate self-peptide were simultaneously conjugated to the azide-modified OVV (azide-OVV) via copper-free click chemistry. The infectivity of peptide-conjugated virus was well kept. Meanwhile, both of the targeting capacity to transferrin receptor (TfR)-overexpressed tumor cells and the in vivo blood circulation time increased. Therefore, the growth of TfR-positive tumor could be significantly inhibited after intravenously injecting the engineered OVV, while no noticeable side effects. This construction strategy can be popularized to other enveloped oncolytic virus (OV), thus a universal engineering platform can be provided for OV cancer therapy.

We present here an analysis of lymphocyte localization and T cell subset composition across the human GI tract including mucosal sites (jejunum, ileum, colon), gut-associated lymphoid tissues (isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), Peyer's patches (PPs), appendix), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) from a total of 68 donors spanning eight decades of life. In pediatric donors, ILFs and PP containing naÃ¯ve T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are prevalent in the jejunum and ileum, respectively; these decline in frequency with age, contrasting stable frequencies of ILFs and T cell subsets in the colon. In the mucosa, tissue resident memory T cells develop during childhood, and persist in high frequencies into advanced ages, while T cell composition changes with age in GALT and MLN. These spatial and temporal features of human intestinal T cell immunity define signatures that can be used to train predictive machine learning algorithms.

We used Escherichia coli Ï70 promoter sequences to test the performance of IBPP and the combination of IBPP and a support vector machine algorithm (IBPP-SVM). The ""images"" generated with IBPP could effectively distinguish promoter from non-promoter sequences. Compared with IBPP, IBPP-SVM showed a substantial improvement in sensitivity. Furthermore, both methods showed good performance for sequences of up to 2,000 nt in length. The performances of IBPP and IBPP-SVM were largely affected by the threshold and dimension of vectors, respectively.

Staphylococcal biofilms are associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and are generally less affected by host immune factors. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel agents that not only aim at multidrug-resistant pathogens, but also ones that will act as anti biofilms. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of the endocannabinoid (EC) anandamide (AEA) and the endocannabinoid-like (EC-like), arachidonoyl serine (AraS) against methicillin resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA). We observed a strong inhibition of biofilm formation of all tested MRSA strains as well as a notable reduction of metabolic activity of pre-formed MRSA biofilms by both agents. Moreover, staphylococcal biofilm-associated virulence determinants such as hydrophobicity, cell aggregation and spreading ability were altered by AEA and AraS. In addition, the agents were able to modify bacterial membrane potential. Importantly, both compounds prevent biofilm formation by altering the surface of the cell without killing the bacteria. Therefore, we propose that EC and EC-like compounds may act as a natural line of defence against MRSA or other antibiotic resistant bacteria. Due to their anti biofilm action these agents could also be a promising alternative to antibiotic therapeutics against biofilm-associated MRSA infections.","Four years after implementation of a national micronutrient powder program in Kyrgyzstan, prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is lower, but prevalence of vitamin A deficiency is higher.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523305,European journal of clinical nutrition,2019 03 07,"In 2009, the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan launched a national Infant and Young Child Nutrition (IYCN) program which included point-of-use fortification of foods with micronutrient powders (MNP) containing iron, vitamin A, and other micronutrients. Caretakers of children aged 6-23 months were given 30 sachets of MNP every 2 months. Micronutrient surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2013. The objective of the study was to compare the prevalence of anemia and deficiencies of iron and vitamin A among children aged 6-29 months prior to the MNP program (2009) with those after full implementation (2013).",Emerging hydrovoltaic technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523296,Nature nanotechnology,2019 06 11,"Water contains tremendous energy in a variety of forms, but very little of this energy has yet been harnessed. Nanostructured materials can generate electricity on interaction with water, a phenomenon that we term the hydrovoltaic effect, which potentially extends the technical capability of water energy harvesting and enables the creation of self-powered devices. In this Review, starting by describing fundamental properties of water and of water-solid interfaces, we discuss key aspects pertaining to water-carbon interactions and basic mechanisms of harvesting water energy with nanostructured materials. Experimental advances in generating electricity from water flows, waves, natural evaporation and moisture are then reviewed to show the correlations in their basic mechanisms and the potential for their integration towards harvesting energy from the water cycle. We further discuss potential device applications of hydrovoltaic technologies, analyse main challenges in improving the energy conversion efficiency and scaling up the output power, and suggest prospects for developments of the emerging technology.",Interatomic force laws that evade dynamic measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523295,Nature nanotechnology,2019 05 01,"Measurement of the force between two atoms is performed routinely with the atomic force microscope. The shape of this interatomic force law is now found to directly regulate this capability: rapidly varying interatomic force laws, which are common in nature, can corrupt their own measurement.",Pathophysiological mechanisms of mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523293,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 02 14,"Accumulating evidence has indicated the potential contributions of aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with primary aldosteronism have a higher risk of CVD and CKD than those with essential hypertension. MR is strongly expressed in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, glomerular mesangial cells, podocytes, and proximal tubular cells. In these cardiovascular and renal cells, aldosterone-induced cell injury is prevented by MR blockade. Interestingly, MR antagonists elicit beneficial effects on CVD and CKD in subjects with low or normal plasma aldosterone levels. Recent studies have shown that during development of CVD and CKD, cardiovascular and renal MR is activated by glucocorticoid and ligand-independent mechanisms, such as Rac1 signaling pathways. These data indicate that inappropriate activation of local MR contributes to cardiovascular and renal tissue injury through aldosterone-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this review, recent findings on the specific role of cardiovascular and renal MR in the pathogenesis of CVD and CKD are summarized.",Association of blood pressure with estimates of 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523292,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 02 14,"While the association between 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion with blood pressure is well established, the relationships of these ions to spot urine measurements are unclear. Our purpose is to assess the association between blood pressure and the estimated 24-h sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples. Spot urine and blood pressure were collected annually during a 5-year period from 4360 Japanese workers with ages ranging from 19 to 55 years. Estimates of 24-h sodium and potassium excretion were based on Tanaka's formula. Overall, a single standard deviation increase in the estimated sodium excretion (36.5âmmol/day) was associated with a 1.3âmmHg higher systolic blood pressure and a 0.8âmmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (Pâ<â0.001). A single standard deviation increase in estimated potassium excretion (8.9âmmol/day) was associated with a 1.1âmmHg lower systolic blood pressure and a 0.7âmmHg lower diastolic blood pressure (Pâ<â0.001). As a combined measure of the excretion of both electrolytes, the estimated 24-h sodium-to-potassium ratio was positively associated with both blood pressures (Pâ<â0.001). Associations of blood pressure with sodium and the sodium-to-potassium ratio increased with age and were stronger in men compared to women. Associations with potassium and the sodium-to-potassium ratio were stronger in individuals who were overweight. The findings provide evidence for an association between blood pressure and the estimated 24-h sodium and potassium excretion from repeated single-spot urine samples. As convenient measures of dietary intake for each electrolyte, repeated spot urine samples may be useful for assessing hypertension risk, especially in men, older individuals, and overweight individuals."
