This process involves coordinated remodeling of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes by conserved dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatases and their partner molecules in response to various physiological and stress stimuli. Although the core machineries that mediate fusion and partitioning of the mitochondrial network have been extensively characterized, many aspects of their function and regulation are incompletely understood and only beginning to emerge. In the present review we briefly summarize current knowledge about how the key mitochondrial dynamics-mediating factors are regulated via selective proteolysis by mitochondrial and cellular proteolytic machineries.",The antitumor activity of naturally occurring chromones: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029639,Fitoterapia,2019 05 20,"Chromones are a group of compounds widely distributed in nature with wide range of biological activities, including antitumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and so on.

Recent research has shown that both plant and animal-based factors are critical in understanding and mitigating larkspur poisoning in cattle. Non-toxicological factors including sex, age, cattle breed, and plant chemotype affect cattle responses to larkspur. For example, Angus heifers are more susceptible to larkspur intoxication than are steers or bulls. Young cattle appear to be more susceptible to larkspur poisoning than mature animals. Beef breeds of cattle are more susceptible to larkspur intoxication than dairy breeds. In addition to animal factors, plant alkaloid composition (chemotype) affects the potential toxicity for cattle because of differences in the ratios and concentrations of highly toxic N-(methylsuccinimido) anthranoyllycoctonine (MSAL)-type alkaloids compared to less lethal non-MSAL-type alkaloids. Animal- and plant-based factors can provide substantial information to inform livestock producers on management to reduce risk and cattle losses to various larkspur species in western North America.","Experimental poisoning by Heterophyllaea pustulata Hook. f. (Rubiaceae) in goats. Clinical, biochemical and toxicological aspects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029636,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 08,"The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, biochemical and toxicological findings of the experimentally poisoning induced by Heterophyllaea pustulata in goats. Ten healthy adult female Saanen breed goats were used in the experiment. The goats were randomly assigned to two groups of five individuals: control and experimental group (CG and EG). Both groups were kept in the same enclosure devoid of shade for 8 h daily. The EG received only H. pustulata samples (leaves and thin steam) and water ad libitum. The CG received lucerne hay. Blood samples were taken at different times after oral administration of vegetal samples, and level of hepatic enzymes, total bilirubin, conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin was measured, together with the detection of anthraquinones (AQs) and phylloerythrin by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector and Mass Spectrometry with Electron Spray Ionization and Quadrupole Time Of Fly analysis. At the same time, skin biopsy samples were collected for AQs determinations. For histopathological examination, hepatic biopsy samples were collected on day 8. Clinically, all goats of the EG revealed photophobia, dermatitis and photosensitization. None of these goats developed jaundice or died during the experiment (15 days). In addition, affected goats exhibited a significant elevation in the serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin. Microscopic examination of the liver samples revealed slight degenerative lesions. Although phylloerythrin was not detected in sera, a high level of two predominant AQs in H. pustulata (rubiadin/soranjidiol) were noted between 24 and 72 h after plant consumption, which coincided with the period in which the clinical signs were more obvious. Since those AQs were not identified in skin samples, the clinical findings were supported by the presence of AQs in sera. Finally, toxicological studies of the AQs are important, since many current works suggest their potential use in the photodynamic therapy.",Detection of okadaic acid (OA) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) simultaneously in seafood samples using colloidal gold immunoassay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029635,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 08,"Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxin mainly responsible for severe neurological illness, and okadaic acid (OA) is another important lipophilic toxin to humans. In this study, we developed a gold strip for simultaneous detection of OA and TTX in real seafood samples. In the assay, the prepared nanoparticles (about 40 nm) was applied to conjugate with specific monoclonal antibodies against OA and TTX, and the resulted mixtures were used to capture its corresponding toxin in test strip. OA and TTX conjugates were coated as two test lines on the nitrocellulose membrane, and goat anti-mouse IgG was used to form the control line, forming three lines on the test strip. The visual detection limits (vLOD) of this immunoassay for OA and TTX were 0.75 and 15 ng/mL, respectively, and no cross reactions were observed in the process of detection. The visual assay for OA and TTX detection could be finished within 10 min. This study might provide a feasible method and good understanding for rapidly simultaneous detection for toxins based on immunoassay.",Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor α silencing attenuates silicosis by inhibiting RhoA/Rho kinase signalling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029634,Experimental cell research,2019 05 18,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) alters the fibroblast phenotype by promoting transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, which exhibit the ability to promote collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thereby playing a significant role in the pathology of silicosis. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms involved in myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα) was upregulated following myofibroblast transdifferentiation stimulated by TGF-β1. We hypothesised that RhoGDIα may induce myofibroblast transdifferentiation and thus result in silicosis. Accordingly, the biological significance of RhoGDIα in cell proliferation and apoptosis was investigated by deletion of RhoGDIα in MRC-5 cells. In addition, a mechanistic study showed that fasudil, an inhibitor of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) signalling pathway, reduced the levels of RhoGDIα, RhoA, and phospho-myosin phosphatase （phospho-MYPT） in MRC-5 cells and silicosis model rats. Knockdown of RhoGDIα inhibited myofibroblast transdifferentiation and collagen deposition through RhoGDIα/RhoA/ROCK signalling in silicosis model mice. Overall, downregulation of RhoGDIα may significantly promote cell apoptosis and inhibit cell growth, resulting in reversal of myofibroblast transdifferentiation by RhoA/ROCK in vitro and in vivo. These data will facilitate further exploration of the potential use of RhoGDIα as a target for silicosis therapy.",Toll-like receptor signal is required in maintenance of immune suppressive capacity of regulatory T cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029633,Immunology letters,2019 05 22,"Dysfunction of immune regulatory cells has been recognized in a variety of immune diseases; the underlying mechanism remains to be further investigated. This study aims to investigate the critical role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal in the maintenance of function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this study, Tregs were isolated from patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and healthy control (HC) subjects. The role of TLR signal in the maintenance of Treg's function was tested with experiments of cell culture and an AR mouse model. We observed that the immune suppressive function of AR Treg (Tregs isolated from AR patients) was impaired, although the number of peripheral AR Treg was comparable with HC Treg. Expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β was lower in AR Tregs than that in HC Tregs that was positively correlated with expression of Mal in Tregs; the latter was lower in AR Tregs as compared to HC Tregs. TGF-β mRNA in Tregs decayed spontaneously in the culture. Activation of Mal counteracted TGF-β decay and maintained the Treg's immune regulatory function. Mal bound Tristetraprolin (TTP) to prevent TTP from inducing TGF-β mRNA decay. Absence of TLR signals resulted in Treg dysfunctional and worsened experimental AR response in a murine model. In conclusion, TLR signal is required in the maintenance of Treg function. Absence of TLR signal may result in Treg dysfunction and immune intolerance.",Relation of plasma carnitine and aminotransferases to alcohol dose and time of dependence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029632,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 04 28,"Serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST, ALT) and plasma carnitine are all indirect biomarkers of alcohol abuse.

In the present study, we present a series of experiments aiming to validate and apply an original high-tech implantable device, consisting of the coupling, for the first time, of an amperometric biosensor for brain ethanol detection, with a sensor for detecting the microvibrations of the animal. This device allows the real-time comparison between the ethanol intake, its cerebral concentrations, and their effect on the motion when the animal is in the condition of voluntary drinking. To this end, we assessed in vitro the efficiency of three different biosensor designs loading diverse alcohol oxidase enzymes (AOx) obtained from three different AOx-donor strains: Hansenula polymorpha, Candida boidinii, and Pichia pastoris. In vitro data disclosed that the devices loading H. polymorpha and C. boidinii were similarly efficient (respectively, linear region slope [LRS]: 1.98 ± 0.07 and 1.38 ± 0.04 nA/mM) but significantly less than the P. pastoris-loaded one (LRS: 7.57 ± 0.12 nA/mM). The in vivo results indicate that this last biosensor design detected the rise of ethanol in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) after 15 minutes of voluntary 10% ethanol solution intake. At the same time, the microvibration sensor detected a significant increase in the rat's motion signal. Notably, both the biosensor and microvibration sensor described similar and parallel time-dependent U-shaped curves, thus providing a highly sensitive and time-locked high-resolution detection of the neurochemical and behavioral kinetics upon voluntary ethanol intake. The results overall indicate that such a dual telemetry unit represents a powerful device which, implanted in different brain areas, may boost further investigations on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie ethanol-induced motor activity and reward."

The aim of this work was to analyze the number of TPE that are performed in different European countries and calculate the rate of TPE per 1,000,000 inhabitants. We contacted the three manufacturers of disposables for performing TPE by centrifugation in Europe (Fresenius Kabi, Haemonetics, and Teurmo BCT) and asked them for the number of disposables sold in each of the countries of the European Union (EU) in 2014 as a surrogate indicator of the TPE performed in the country. A total of 101,767 disposable units to perform TPE using centrifugation devices were sold in the EU in 2014. A huge variation exists in the number of disposable units of PTE sold in the different EU countries. A factor of 51 separates the rate of TPE per 1 million inhabitants performed by centrifugation in the country with the highest number (Belgium, 459) from the country with the lowest (Romania, 9). That variation probably is due to differences in healthcare expenditure but also differences in practice.","Therapeutic apheresis in neurological, nephrological and gastrointestinal diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029610,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,2019 06 15,"Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a process in which plasma containing antibodies, immune complexes, inflammatory moderators, paraproteins and other toxins which are believed to be the cause of disease is removed from a patient.

Although various methods for the prediction of PPIs have been developed in the past decades, their robustness and prediction accuracy need to be improved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective and accurate method to predict PPIs. Aiming at making sure that PPIs can be predicted effectively, in this paper, we propose a new sequence-based approach based on deep neural network (DNN) and conjoint triad auto covariance (CTAC) to improve the effectiveness of predicting PPIs. The coding method of CTAC combines the advantages of conjoint triad and auto covariance. Therefore, the CTAC can obtain more PPIs information from the amino acid sequence. The model of DNNCTAC achieved an accuracy of 98.37%, recall of 99.41%, area under the curve (AUC) of 99.24% and loss of 22.7%, respectively, on human dataset. These results indicate that DNNCTAC can enhance the predictive power of PPIs and can significantly enhance the accuracy of the prediction. And, it has proved to be a useful complement to future proteomics research.

A Ginzburg-Landau partial differential equation system is utilised to study the change of size and shape of a cross-section caused by mechanically enhanced bone growth. The concept is based on a phase variable that keeps track of the material properties during the evolution of the bone. The relevant free energies are assumed to be elastic strain energy, concentration gradient energy and a double well chemical potential. The equation governing the evolution of the phase is derived from the total free energy and put on a non-dimensional form, which reduces all required information regarding load, material and cross-section size to one single parameter. The partial differential equation is solved numerically for the geometry of a cross-section using a finite element method. Bending in both moving and fixed directions is investigated regarding reshaping and growth rates. A critical non-zero load is found under which the bone is resorbed. The result for bending around a fixed axis can be compared with experiments made on turkeys. Three loading intervals are identified, I) low load giving resorption of bone on the external periosteum and the internal endosteum, II) intermediate load with growth at the periosteum and resorption at endosteum and III) large loads with growth at both periosteum and endosteum. In the latter case the extent of the medullary cavity decreases.",Stochastic population model of Zea mays L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029607,Mathematical biosciences,2019 05 19,"We propose a minimalist stochastic population model of maize, focused on the description of the maize vegetative stages (seedlings with different number of leaves) involved in the propagation of vector-borne diseases. This model was parameterized from laboratory and field experiments and from observational field studies for multiple hybrids and different weather and soil conditions, taking into account only temperature as input variable. We propose three different submodels to estimate the distribution of the Final Leaf Number NFLN in the plants and to estimate the tassel initiation probability. The first submodel (submodel A), with a fixed NFLN, is adaptable to any particular hybrid, the second and third submodels allow to simulate plants with an empirical NFLN distribution according to bibliographic averages (submodel B) or according to a Poisson Process (submodel C). The three submodels are able to describe the temporal development of populations and events. A good agreement is observed between the development times predicted by the model and the values obtained from laboratory experiments at constant temperature, field experiments carried out in Brazil and Australia and observational studies performed in Argentina. This model may be improved and coupled to leaf growth models and leaf area estimation models to be able to estimate not only the temporal development of populations and events but also the temporal development of the leaf area by plant, which is believed to be related to the carrying capacity of maize specialists insects, vectors of maize diseases.",Lavage lipidomics signatures in children with cystic fibrosis and protracted bacterial bronchitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029606,Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society,2019 04 28,"Balanced composition of a well-functioning pulmonary surfactant is crucial and essential for normal breathing.

The phycobilisome has evolved to efficiently absorb sun energy and transfer it to the photosystems via the last energy acceptors of the phycobilisome, ApcD and ApcE. ApcF also affects energy transfer by interacting with ApcE. In this work we studied the role of ApcD and ApcF in energy transfer and state transitions in Synechococcus elongatus and Synechocystis PCC6803. Our results demonstrate that these proteins have different roles in both processes in the two strains. The lack of ApcD and ApcF inhibits state transitions in Synechocystis but not in S. elongatus. In addition, lack of ApcF decreases energy transfer to both photosystems only in Synechocystis, while the lack of ApcD alters energy transfer to photosystem I only in S. elongatus. Thus, conclusions based on results obtained in one cyanobacterial strain cannot be systematically transferred to other strains and the putative role(s) of phycobilisomes in state transitions need to be reconsidered.",Photosynthetic regulation under fluctuating light in young and mature leaves of the CAM plant Bryophyllum pinnatum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029592,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

However, the response of PSI to fluctuating light in young leaves has not yet been clarified. Furthermore, the photosynthetic regulation under fluctuating light in crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants is little known. In this study, we measured PSI redox state and the electrochromic shift signal in the mature and young leaves of a CAM species Bryophyllum pinnatum. The mature leaves showed stronger capacity for photo-reduction of O2 mediated by the alternative electron flow (probably the water-water cycle) when compared with the young leaves. After an increase in light intensity, both the mature and young leaves showed insufficient proton gradient (ΔpH) across the thylakoid membranes within the first seconds. Meanwhile, PSI was highly oxidized in the mature leaves but was in a more reduced state in the young leaves. Furthermore, young leaves were more susceptible to PSI photoinhibition under fluctuating light. Therefore, in the mature leaves, the alternative electron flow significantly optimized the PSI redox state under fluctuating light at relatively low ΔpH.

Resolution is with hydrophobic-polar (H-P) sequences in inhomogeneous 2D square lattices, since general biophysicochemical trends consider i) that the backbone is one of the major components responsible for protein folding and ii) osmolyte effect plays an important role to better folding kinetics and reach deeper optima. We have designed foldamers, as square n × n (n = 3, 4, 5, 6) arrays of hydrophobic cores stabilized by H⋯H contacts, attached through short PP (P2) or long PPPP (P4) loops, giving rise to 8 sequences (S1 to S8) with known optimal scores. Designed sequences were folded into different inhomogeneous spaces and indeed crowded media induced deeper optima, being crowding necessary to best fold, but the space should be enough constrained to induce folding without banning chain movement. The constrained space plays an important role to reach the optimal structure, depending on designed foldamer sequence size, for an optimal correlation length, implying that media affects the folding pathways as happens in real systems. Designed structures were found, moreover, they undergo to degenerated states, both folding states could survey considering i) backbone information and ii) osmolyte effect. In nature, the proteins fold in different structures aiming to reach a global minimum, but a local minimum could be enough to the protein to be functional or dysfunctional.",Combining opioids and non-opioids for pain management: Current status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029588,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 07,"Pain remains a global health challenge. For decades, clinicians have been primarily relying on μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management. MOR agonists remain the most efficacious analgesics available; however, adverse effects related to MOR agonists use are severe which often lead to forced drug discontinuation and inadequate pain relief. The recent opioid overdose epidemic urges the development of safer analgesics. Combination therapy is a well-established clinical pharmacotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of various clinical disorders. The combination of MOR agonists with non-MOR agonists may increase the analgesic potency of MOR agonists, reduce the development of tolerance and dependence, reduce the diversion and abuse, overdose, and reduce other clinically significant side effects associated with prolonged opioid use such as constipation. Overall, the combination therapy approach could substantially improve the therapeutic profile of MOR agonists. This review summarizes some recent developments in this field.",Null mutation in P4h-tm leads to decreased fear and anxiety and increased social behavior in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029587,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 31,"HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs, also known as PHDs and EGLNs) are crucial enzymes that modulate the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) response and help to maintain cellular oxygen homeostasis. This function is especially well-known for cytoplasmic or nuclear enzymes HIF-P4H-1-3 (PHDs 1-3, EGLNs 2, 1 and 3, respectively), but the physiological role is still obscure for a fourth suggested HIF-P4H, P4H-TM that is a transmembrane protein and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently however, both experimental and clinical evidence of the P4H-TM involvement in CNS physiology has emerged. In this study, we first investigated the expression pattern of P4H-TM in the mouse brain and found a remarkably selective abundance in brains areas that are involved in social behaviors and anxiety including amygdala, lateral septum and bed nucleus of stria terminalis. Next, we performed behavioral assays in P4h-tm-/- mice to investigate a possible phenotype associated to these brain areas. In locomotor activity tests, we found that P4h-tm-/- mice were significantly more active than their wild-type (WT) littermate mice, and habituation to test environment did not abolish this effect. Instead, spatial learning and memory seemed normal in P4h-tm-/- mice as assessed by Morris swim task. In several tests assessing anxiety and fear responses, P4h-tm-/- mice showed distinct courageousness, and they presented increased interaction towards fellow mice in social behavior tests. Most strikingly, P4h-tm-/- mice practically lacked behavioral despair response, a surrogate marker of depression, in forced swim and tail suspension tests. Instead, mutant mice of all other Hif-p4h isoforms lacked such a behavioral phenotype. In summary, this study presents a remarkable anatomy-physiology association between the brain expression of P4H-TM and the behavioral phenotype in P4h-tm-/- mice. Future studies will reveal whether P4H-TM may serve as a novel target for anti-depressant and anti-anxiety pharmacotherapy.",The current gold standard breast volumetry technique seems to overestimate fat graft volume retention in the breast: A validation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029582,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",2019 04 28,"MRI is generally considered as the gold standard for measuring breast volume because of its high accuracy of the modality.

She underwent three large-volume lumbar punctures, all of which were negative for malignancy. An optic nerve biopsy was ultimately performed, demonstrating malignant cells on immunohistochemical staining. This case illustrates a rare case of biopsy-proven leukemic infiltration of the optic nerve head as the presenting sign of leukemic relapse despite a negative systemic workup.

The living donor was seropositive for human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and the recipient was seronegative for HTLV-1 before transplantation. After transplantation, the recipient developed steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection, which was successfully treated using anti-thymocyte globulin, and he was eventually discharged. He underwent spinal surgery twice after the transplantation for the treatment of cervical spondylosis that had been present for a period of 9 months before the transplantation. The surgery improved his gait impairment temporarily. However, his gait impairment progressed, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple sites of myelopathy. He was diagnosed with HAM 16 months after the transplantation. Pulse steroid therapy (1000mg) was administered over a period of 3 days, and his limb paresis improved. Presently, steroid therapy is being continued, with a plan to eventually taper the dose, and he is being carefully followed up at our institution. Our case suggests that liver transplantation involving an HTLV-1-positive living donor carries the risk of virus transmission and short-term development of HAM after transplantation.",Phase III Trial of Intravenous Mannitol Versus Placebo During Nephron-sparing Surgery: Post Hoc Analysis of 3-yr Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029560,European urology focus,2019 04 28,"Our recently reported phase III trial demonstrated that patients undergoing nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥45 ml/min/1.73 m2 who received mannitol had no improvement in renal function at 6 mo compared with those who received placebo. Some authors have suggested that benefit is restricted to subgroups, such as those with comorbidities. We assessed whether preoperative eGFR, or other patient and surgical factors modified the effect of mannitol on postoperative outcomes at 6 mo and with extended follow-up. We also assessed whether mannitol was associated with differences in long-term GFR years after surgery. No significant difference between the mannitol or placebo groups (mean eGFR difference: 1.4; 95% confidence interval: -2.6, 5.3; p = 0.5) was found in the 134 patients with known eGFR at 3 yr after NSS. At both 6 mo and 3 yr, the effect of mannitol was not significantly modified by patient or surgical factors including preoperative eGFR. In summary, we validated our original trial conclusions by finding that intraoperative use of mannitol does not improve either short- or long-term renal function in patients undergoing NSS. Specifically, there is no evidence that comorbidities, including lower preoperative eGFR, modify the effect of mannitol. PATIENT SUMMARY: Use of mannitol at the time of partial nephrectomy does not improve either short- or long-term renal function even in patients with comorbidities, including lower preoperative renal function.

However, the overall size of effect at late preterm and term gestational ages is less than for early and moderate preterm birth and should be countered against the potential harms. Evidence from randomized trials suggest an increase in the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia after corticosteroid use prior to late preterm birth; any effect of antenatal corticosteroids on neonatal glycemic control after planned cesarean section birth or for infants born to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy is unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests neonatal hypoglycemia may adversely affect childhood development.

Recent studies revealed microRNA mediated regulation of tumor aggressiveness and metastasis; however, whether specific microRNAs regulate tumor radioresistance and can be exploited as radiosensitizing agents remains unclear. Here, we find that miR-29b could promote radiosensitivity in radioresistant subpopulations of cervical cancer cells. Notably, therapeutic delivery of miR-29b mimics via R11-SSPEI nanoparticle, whose specificity has been proved by our previous studies, can sensitize the tumor to radiation in a xenograft model. Mechanistically, we reveal a novel function of miR-29b in regulating intracellular reactive oxygen species signaling and explore a potential application for its use in combination with therapies known to increase oxidative stress such as radiation. Moreover, miR-29b inhibits DNA damage repair by targeting phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromsome ten (PTEN), and overexpression of PTEN could partially rescue miR-29b-mediated homologous recombination (HR)-DNA damage repair and increase radiosensitivity. These findings identify miR-29b as a radiosensitizing microRNA and reveal a new therapeutic strategy for radioresistant tumors."

In most cases, autoantibodies trigger complement-mediated endplate damage and extraocular muscles may be most susceptible. A proportion of MG cases develop treatment-resistant ophthalmoplegia. We reviewed publications spanning 65 years reporting the histopathological findings in the muscles and extraocular muscles of myasthenic patients to determine whether pathological changes in extraocular muscles differ from non-ocular muscles. As extraocular muscles represent a unique muscle allotype we also compared their histopathology in myasthenia to those in strabismus. We found that in myasthenia gravis, the non-ocular muscles frequently demonstrate neurogenic changes regardless of myasthenic serotype. Mitochondrial stress/damage was also frequent in myasthenic muscles and possibly more evident in muscle-specific kinase antibody-positive MG. Although myasthenia-associated paralysed extraocular muscles demonstrated prominent fibro-fatty replacement and mitochondrial alterations, these features appeared commonly in paralysed extraocular muscles of any cause. We postulate that extraocular muscles may be more susceptible than limb muscles to poor contractility as a consequence of myasthenia, resulting in a cascade of atrophy signaling pathways and altered mitochondrial homeostasis which contribute to the tipping point in developing treatment-resistant myasthenic ophthalmoplegia.

Correlations with Brooke scale and Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) score were very high for maximal active joint angle, high for maximal muscle torque and maximal surface electromyography amplitude, and moderate for mean echogenicity and maximal passive joint angle. Multivariable regression analysis showed that maximal active joint angle and maximal muscle torque were significantly associated with Brooke score (R2 = 0.91). Maximal active joint angle, maximal passive joint angle, and maximal muscle torque were significantly associated with PUL score (R2 = 0.94). Based on the most critical physiological outcome variables, we constructed an exploratory biophysical model of the working mechanisms leading to limitations in upper extremity task performance. Better insights in these working mechanisms could support clinical management of upper extremity limitations and facilitate the development of interventions.

Over 270 delegates (73% from Africa) from 40 countries of which 30 (75%) were from African countries attended the symposium. Participants in this symposium included research scientists, clinicians, immunization managers, public health officials, policymakers and vaccine manufacturers. At the time of the symposium, 38 of the 54 (70%) countries in Africa had introduced rotavirus vaccines into their national immunization schedules. Delegates shared progress from rotavirus surveillance and vaccine impact monitoring, demonstrating the impact of the vaccine against rotavirus diarrheal hospitalizations. Data supported the beneficial effect and safety of WHO pre-qualified available vaccines up to 2017 (RotaTeq, Rotarix). This symposium highlighted the dramatic impact of the rotavirus vaccination, called for urgent adoption of these vaccines in remaining countries, particularly those with high disease burden and large birth cohorts (e.g. Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo) to attain the full public health benefits of rotavirus vaccination in Africa.","Characteristics of immunized and un-immunized students, including non-medical exemptions, in Ontario, Canada: 2016-2017 school year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029513,Vaccine,2019 05 10,"Our objectives were: (1) to quantify and describe un-immunized students in Ontario, Canada and assess the extent to which these students have exemptions; and (2) to quantify and describe students with non-medical exemptions (NMEs), including what proportion have up-to-date immunizations.","HLA genetic study from United Arab Emirates (UAE), Abu Dhabi.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029512,Human immunology,2019 04 28,"Emiratis belong to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) country.

Vascular injury may shape innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to dysregulation in the balance between tolerance and immunoreactivity to vascular-derived antigens. Mounting evidence shows that the early stages of apoptosis, characterized by the absence of membrane permeabilization, are prone to trigger various modes of intercellular communication allowing neoantigen production, exposure, or both. In this review, we present the evidence for the release of LG3, an immunogenic fragment of perlecan, as a consequence of caspase-3 dependent vascular apoptosis leading to the genesis of anti-LG3 autoantibodies and the consequences of these autoantibodies in native and transplanted kidneys.","Surgical outcomes of patients with diffuse-type tenosynovial giant-cell tumours: an international, retrospective, cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029509,The Lancet.

Blackwater, containing concentrated organic materials, can be anaerobically digested to recovery bioenergy. However, the methane recovery from blackwater is often inhibited by the presence of high free ammonia (FA) in blackwater. In order to improve the methane production in blackwater, nano-scale zero valent iron (nZVI, 35 nm or 50 nm) or micro-scale zero valent iron (mZVI, 200 μm) at different dosages (i.e., 0.5, 1, and 10 g/L) were applied respectively in the anaerobic digestion (AD) reactor for blackwater treatment. The results demonstrated that low doses (0.5-1 g/L) of nZVI slightly improved methane (CH4) production, possibly due to a reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and improved hydrolysis-acidification in the nZVI supplemented systems. However, a lower biochemical methane potential (BMP) of blackwater was observed with high doses (10 g/L) of nZVI which induced a pH increase (>8.5) in AD reactor leading to a higher FA inhibition of CH4 production. In contrast, the effect of mZVI on blackwater AD system was not significant.

PAC indicators demonstrate that the intervention integrates safer uterine aspiration technology such as the Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) syringe into obstetric practice and facilitates task-shifting from physicians to midwives. In other words, PAC not only saves women's lives, but more generally enhances the organization, quality, and cost-effectiveness of obstetric care. This article draws on my ethnography of Senegal's PAC program, conducted between 2010 and 2011, to illustrate how PAC indicators obscure the professional and technological complexities of treating abortion complications in contexts where abortion is illegal. Data collection methods include observation of PAC services and records at three hospitals; 66 in-depth interviews with health workers, government health officials, and NGO personnel; and a review of national and global PAC data. I show how anxieties about the capacity of the MVA syringe to induce abortion have engendered practices and policies that compromise the quality and availability of care throughout the health system. I explore the multivalent power of MVA statistics in strategically conveying commitments to national and global maternal mortality reduction agendas while eliding profound gaps in access to and quality of care for low-income and rural women. I argue that PAC strategies, technologies, and indicators must be situated within a global framework of reproductive governance, in which safe abortion has been omitted from maternal and reproductive health care associated with reproductive rights. Ethnographic attention to daily obstetric practices challenges globally circulating narratives about PAC as an apolitical intervention, revealing not only how anxieties about abortion ironically suppress the very rates of MVA utilization that purportedly convey PAC quality, but also how they simultaneously give rise to and obscure obstetric violence against women.",The effect of smart homes on older adults with chronic conditions: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029481,"Geriatric nursing (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 28,"As populations continue to age, the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions in older adults grows.

The results reveal that the scaling effects largely depended on Péclet and Damköhler numbers. Consumption rate estimates based on volume-averaged concentrations and reaction kinetics overestimated the true volumetric reaction rates, and large-sized biomass aggregates intensified these scaling errors. In contrast, the macroscopic rates estimated via flux-weighted concentrations underestimated the true volumetric reaction rates, with large microbial aggregates reducing scaling errors.

MACs were classified into four categories according to the predominant pattern of floating tumour cells: strips (27.1%), clusters (51.8%), signet ring cells (6.7%), and mixed clusters and signet ring cells (14.4%). In addition, we categorised MACs according to the relative amount of mucin. MACs with signet ring cell component were clearly associated with poor overall and recurrence-free survivals. Moreover, MACs with more than 50% signet ring cell component showed particularly poor clinical outcome just like non-mucinous signet ring cell carcinoma. MACs with a greater amount of extracellular mucin were associated with poor recurrence-free survival, independent of the pathological stage. In addition, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, advanced pathological stage, and old age at diagnosis were also prognostic factors for poor overall survival. MACs with more than 50% signet ring cell component should be classified as signet ring cell carcinoma and the presence of signet ring cells should be included in the pathology report of MACs with 10-50% signet ring cell component."

In the present study, EVs released by osteoblasts at different stages of the mineralization process were investigated for their potential ability to promote bone formation. Results showed that the characteristics of EVs of mineralizing osteoblasts changed with regularity. EVs derived from the mid-to-late differentiation stage remarkably promoted osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and improved osteoporosis in ovariectomized mice. The findings also revealed that the effect of EVs on osteogenesis was related with the maturity of matrix vesicles (MVs), a kind of EVs selectively released by mineralizing-related cells. Nevertheless, only the EVs from the mid-to-late stage showed osteoinductive properties, Synthetic cartilage lymph (SCL) treatment of EVs from the middle stage could promote MV maturation but showed no effect on osteoinduction. Additionally, EVs derived at the middle and mid-to-late stages showed innate bone-targeting potential.

The loss of function of IDS leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate of glycosaminoglycans throughout the body, resulting in skeletal deformities, mental retardation, rigid joints, and thick skin. Recently, enzyme replacement therapy has become a common strategy for treating this condition. However, its effectiveness on the central nervous system (CNS) is limited because intravenously administered recombinant IDS (rIDS) cannot pass through the blood brain barrier. Therefore, several methods for delivering rIDS to the CNS, using anti-human transferrin receptor antibody and adeno-associated virus 9, have been explored. To investigate additional approaches for treatment, more cognition about the intracellular dynamics of mutant IDS is essential. We have already found that mutant IDS accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although the dynamics of degradation of mutant IDS was revealed, the molecular mechanism related to the folding of mutant IDS in the ER remained unclear. In this research, we confirmed that mutant IDS retained in the ER would be folded by binding with calnexin (CNX). Thus, knockdown of CNX reduced the translocation of mutant IDS from ER to lysosome and its enzyme activity, indicating that the correct folding of this protein via interaction with CNX ensures its functional activity. These findings reveal the possibility that modifying the interaction of mutant IDS and CNX could contribute to alternative therapeutic strategies for MPS II.",Anxiety and task performance changes in an aging mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029428,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"Due to the increasing focus on aging as an important risk factor for many serious diseases and an emphasis on animal models that have translational value, an increasing number of animal models are being aged. Animal behavior tests can be used to assess effects of aging in mouse models. Female mice begin exhibiting anxiety-like behaviors at 12 months of age which become more serious at 24 months, while males exhibit no age-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Males and females equally demonstrate a failure of daily task performance at 24 months. Despite these cognitive changes, the mice do not show changes in gross motor function. These results suggest cognitive impairment in non-genetically modified aging mice.",Identification of the O-GalNAcylation site(s) on FOXA1 catalyzed by ppGalNAc-T2 enzyme in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029427,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"FOXA1 functions as a pioneer factor of transcriptional regulation that binds to specific sites in the chromatin and recruits other transcription factors, promoting the initiation of gene transcription and mediating the regulation of downstream target gene expression. FOXA1 was reported to facilitate or reprogram ERα binding, thus playing a key function in breast cancer progression. Our previous results indicated that the O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc) modification of FOXA1 plays a potentially significant role in the ERα transcription network. However, further investigations are needed to identify the specific mechanism of modification and the specific glycosylation sites on FOXA1. In this study, we first suggested that FOXA1 could be O-GalNAcylated by ppGalNAc-T2 in vitro. By dividing and expressing recombinant FOXA1 as three segments, two O-GalNAcylation sites were found on FOXA1, both located at the C-terminal of the protein. Then, synthesized peptides, including the predicted O-GalNAc sites in the C-terminus of FOXA1, were used in a vitro reaction, and peptides mutated at the predicted O-GalNAc sites were employed as controls. Through an ESI-MS assay, S354 and S355 were identified as probable O-GalNAcylation sites on FOXA1. Additionally, we performed ESI-ETD-MS/MS analysis of the full-length O-GalNAcylated FOXA1 protein and identified S355 as the O-GalNAc modification site on FOXA1, consistent with the peptide reaction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that FOXA1 can be O-GalNAcylated by ppGalNAc-T2 at S355 in vitro. These results will provide new insights for studying the role of O-GalNAcylation in the development of breast cancer.","Cloning, expression, and characterization of the zebrafish Dicer and Drosha enzymes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029426,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"The biogenesis of animal microRNAs (miRNAs) involves transcription followed by a series of processing steps, with Drosha and Dicer being two key enzymes that cleave primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) and precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) transcripts, respectively. While human and fly Dicer and human Drosha are well studied, their homologs in other organisms have not been biochemically characterized, leaving open the question of whether their miRNA substrate specificities and regulatory functions are conserved. Zebrafish is a widely used model organism, but its miRNA processing enzymes have never been reconstituted and analyzed. In this study we cloned and constructed expression plasmids encoding zebrafish Dicer, Drosha, and their accessory proteins TARBP2 and DGCR8. After transfection of human cell cultures, we isolated the recombinant protein complexes. We found that zebrafish Dicer bound TARBP2, but Dicer alone exhibited significant pre-miRNA processing activity. On the other hand, zebrafish Drosha associated with DGCR8, and both were required to cleave pri-miRNAs. The Drosha/DGCR8 holoenzyme preferred pri-miRNAs with a large terminal loop, an extended duplex region, and flanking single stranded RNAs. These results lay the foundation for future studies of the regulatory roles and conserved mechanisms of Drosha and Dicer.",Role of orexin in exercise-induced leptin sensitivity in the mediobasal hypothalamus of mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029425,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"Orexin is known as an important neuropeptide in the regulation of energy metabolism. However, the role of orexin in exercise-induced leptin sensitivity in the hypothalamus has been unclear. In this study, we determined the effect of transient treadmill exercise on leptin sensitivity in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of mice and examined the role of orexin in post-exercise leptin sensitivity. Treadmill running for 45 min increased the orexin neuron activity in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of a submaximal dose of leptin after exercise stimulated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in MBH of mice post-exercise compared with that in non-exercised mice, although intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of leptin did not enhance STAT3 phosphorylation, even after exercise. Icv injection of an orexin receptor antagonist, SB334867 reduced STAT3 phosphorylation, which was enhanced by icv injection of orexin but not by direct injection of orexin into MBH. Exercise increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in the MBH of mice, while ERK phosphorylation was reduced by SB334867. Leptin injection after exercise increased the leptin level in MBH, whereas icv injection of SB334867 suppressed the increase in the leptin level in MBH of mice. These results indicate that the activation of orexin neurons by exercise may contribute to the enhancement of leptin sensitivity in MBH. This effect may be mediated by increased transportation of circulating leptin into MBH, with the involvement of ERK phosphorylation.",Photobiomodulation and gametogenic potential of human Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029424,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"Recently, light emitting diode (LED) irradiation has been introduced as a new strategy to enhance proliferation and affect differentiation of stem cells. Human Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal (hWJM) cells have unique characteristics that make them an appropriate source of stem cells for use in basic and clinical applications. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of polarized (PL) and non-polarized (NPL) red light irradiation on gametogenic differentiation of hWJM cells in the presence or absence of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and retinoic acid (RA). Exposure of hWJM cells to PL and NPL red LED (625 nm, 1.9 J/cm2) with or without BMP4+RA pre-treatment effectively differentiated them into germ lineage when the gene expression pattern (Fragilis, DAZL, VASA, SCP3 and Acrosin) and protein synthesis (anti-DAZL, anti-VASA, anti-SCP3 and anti-Acrosin antibodies) of the induced cells was evaluated.

Here, we report that miR-7 expression was down-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines due to DNA hypermethylation. miR-7 overexpression significantly inhibits the proliferation and migration of CRC cells in vitro. TRIP6 was found to be a direct target gene of miR-7. The proliferation inhibition of CRC cells mediated by miR-7 could be rescued after TRIP6 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of TRIP6 reduced miR-7 inhibitor-mediated CRC cell migration and invasion. These findings demonstrate that miR-7 could inhibit the proliferation and migration of CRC cells by targeting TRIP6 and that miR-7 might serve as a good strategy for diagnosing and treating CRC.",MiR-466h-5p induces expression of myocardin with complementary promoter sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029421,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"A number of studies microRNAs (miRNA) play an important role in cardiac physiological and pathological processes. In these studies, miRNA regulates gene expression by repressing translation or directing sequence-specific degradation of complementary mRNA. Here, we reveal a new regulatory mechanism in the process of cardiac hypertrophy which miRNA may also regulate the promoter activity of target genes. In the course of the study, we find that miR-466h-5p regulates the occurrence of myocardial hypertrophy via myocardin and it can upregulate the expression of myocardin through directly binding to the promoter region of myocardin. Meanwhile, we also find that myocardin can reverse-activate miR-466h-5p expression through binding to the CarG box. Thus, miR-466h-5p and myocardin form a positive regulation loop in the process of cardiac hypertrophy. These findings reveal a new mode by which miRNAs may regulate gene expression and may play a positive role in revealing the complete mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy."

Daxx was found in association with transcriptionally silent chromatin predominantly with a heterochromatin rim surrounding the nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs) at all stages studied. At the zygote stage, Daxx was detected only at the periphery of NPBs both in male and female pronuclei. At the late two-cell stage, Daxx was localized not only in the heterochromatin rim at the periphery of NPBs but also in heterochromatin zones not associated with NPBs. At the morula stage, a diffuse distribution of Daxx prevailed. Scarce Daxx-positive zones were detected only in some embryos at the nucleolar periphery. Thus, Daxx is noticeably redistributed during mouse embryo cleavage, and the most conspicuous areas of Daxx concentration are observed at the end of two-cell stage. Daxx is found colocalized with the chromatin-remodeling protein ATRX exclusively in two-cell embryos, but the heterochromatin areas containing either Daxx or ATRX individually are also observed at this stage. However, most zones containing both Daxx and ATRX demonstrated a low FRET-efficiency. This suggest that two molecules are not approached sufficiently close for molecular interactions to occur. Our data suggests that Daxx may function without cooperation with ATRX at least at some stages of early mouse development.",Central Amygdala Prepronociceptin-Expressing Neurons Mediate Palatable Food Consumption and Reward.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029403,Neuron,2019 06 06,"Food palatability is one of many factors that drives food consumption, and the hedonic drive to feed is a key contributor to obesity and binge eating. In this study, we identified a population of prepronociceptin-expressing cells in the central amygdala (PnocCeA) that are activated by palatable food consumption. Ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of these cells reduces palatable food consumption. Additionally, ablation of PnocCeA cells reduces high-fat-diet-driven increases in bodyweight and adiposity. PnocCeA neurons project to the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vBNST), parabrachial nucleus (PBN), and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and activation of cell bodies in the central amygdala (CeA) or axons in the vBNST, PBN, and NTS produces reward behavior but did not promote feeding of palatable food. These data suggest that the PnocCeA network is necessary for promoting the reinforcing and rewarding properties of palatable food, but activation of this network itself is not sufficient to promote feeding.",Does spontaneous adverse drug reactions' reporting differ between different reporters?

The fabricated material was characterized in all aspects and then the experimental works for Pb(II) ion assessing were carried in batch mode. The CJA was exposed the color and signal intensity upon addition of Pb(II) ion from low to high concentrations. The optimum pH was considered at 5.50 based on the sensitivity, the color formation ability and high adsorption of Pb(II) ion. The determined limit of low detection was 0.18 μg/L, which was the extraordinary performance for the Pb(II) ion monitoring ability by the CJA. The adsorption efficiency, specific attention was remunerated to the influence of solution pH, reaction time, foreign ion, initial Pb(II) amounts and regeneration. The CJA was exhibited high kinetic performances and showed high adsorption Pb(II) ion compared with the different forms of material. The adsorption was completely fitted with the Langmuir adsorption as defining the monolayer coverage as expected of the homogeneous porosity of the CJA. The maximum adsorption was determined as high as 175.16 mg/g.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 04 28,"Since large bone defects cannot be healed by the body itself, continuous effort is put into the development of 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. One method to fabricate such scaffolds is selective laser sintering (SLS). However, there is a lack of solvent-free prepared microparticles suitable for SLS. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop a solvent-free polylactide/calcium carbonate composite powder with tailored material properties for SLS. Four composite powders with a composition of approximately 75 wt% polylactide (PLLA as well as PDLLA) and 25 wt% calcium carbonate (calcite) were prepared by a milling process based on GMP standards. Four different grades of polylactide were chosen to cover a broad inherent viscosity range of 1.0-3.6 dl/g. The composite material with the lowest inherent viscosity (1.0 dl/g) showed the best processability by SLS. This was caused by the small polymer particle diameter (50 μm) and the small zero-shear melt viscosity (400 Pa·s), which led to fast sintering. The SLS process parameters were developed to achieve low micro-porosity (approx. 2%) and low polymer degradation (no measurable decrease of the inherent viscosity). A biaxial bending strength of up to 75 MPa was achieved. Cell culture assays indicated good viability of MG-63 osteoblast-like cells on the SLS specimens. Finally, the manufacture of 3D scaffolds with interconnected pore structure was demonstrated.

In addition, supramolecular-based nanofibers can achieve extra controllable and dynamic responsive (e.g. pH, temperature) functions in different environments. In this review, we retrospected and summarized the recent development of supramolecular-based nanofibers, focusing particularly on electrospun supramolecular nanofibers, while also touching on the advances of directly self-assembled supramolecular nanofibers without the use of electrospinning.

The mechanical strength of the cross-linked collagen membranes, namely OPCs-Col films, using different concentrations of OPCs ranged from 30 to 60 kPa. The cross-linked collagen membranes had better thermal stability than non-cross-linked one and could effectively resist the decomposition in collagenase solution as long as fifty days. The results of material characterization showed that 10% OPCs-Col film was ideal for our purpose. In vitro study using L929 and MG-63 cells revealed that 10% OPCs-Col film had great biocompatibility while OPC was demonstrated to be not cytotoxic as glutaraldehyde and genipin but even promote L929 cells.

To date, there is no ideal structure that provides these conditions for bone regeneration. In the current study, we aim to develop a novel scaffold that induces MSC migration towards the defect site, followed by their differentiation into an osteogenic lineage. We have fabricated a gelatin/nano-hydroxyapatite (G/nHAp) scaffold that delivered cannabidiol (CBD)-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres to critical size radial bone defects in a rat model. The fabricated scaffolds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and then analyzed for porosity and degradation rate. The release profile of CBD from the PLGA microsphere and CBD-PLGA-G/nHAp scaffold was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. We performed an in vitro assessment of the effects of CBD on cellular behaviors of viability and osteogenic differentiation. Radiological evaluation, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of all defects in the scaffold and control groups were conducted following transplantation into the radial bone defects. An in vitro migration assay showed that CBD considerably increased MSCs migration. qRT-PCR results showed upregulated expression of osteogenic markers in the presence of CBD. Histological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed new bone formation and reconstruction of the defect at 4 and 12 week post-surgery (WPS) in the CBD-PLGA-G/nHAp group. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed enhanced migration of MSCs into the defect areas in the CBD-PLGA-G/nHAp group in vivo. Based on the results of the current study, we concluded that CBD improved bone healing and showed a critical role for MSC migration in the bone regeneration process.",Gamma-poly glutamate/gelatin composite hydrogels crosslinked by proanthocyanidins for wound healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029356,"Materials science & engineering.

Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), naturally occurring plant metabolites and potent antioxidants, were investigated as a non-toxic crosslinking agent in this study. The effects of hydrogels on the degree of crosslinking, swelling, in vitro degradation, mechanical properties and radical scavenging activity were systemically evaluated. A cell viability assay demonstrated that these OPCs crosslinked γ-PGA/gelatin (PGO) hydrogels were not cytotoxic to L929 fibroblasts. Dermal irritation and skin sensitization tests were examined using a guinea pig model; the hydrogels were considered to be neither allergic nor a dermal sensitizer in guinea pigs. Lastly, an in vivo wound healing model in rats was used to study the effects of the hydrogels on wound healing for 21 days. PGO hydrogels formed by both Na and Ca salts could accelerate wound contraction and re-epithelialization, in which Na-PGO hydrogel was significantly better than the untreated control group.

Genetic and epigenetic alterations of the cells are the consequences of MDR, resulted in drug resistivity, which reflects in impaired delivery of cytotoxic agents to the cancer site. Nanotechnology-based nanocarriers have shown immense shreds of evidence in overcoming these problems, where these promising tools handle desired dosage load of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics to facilitate designing of safe, controlled and effective delivery to specifically at tumor microenvironment. Therefore, encapsulating drugs within the nano-architecture have shown to enhance solubility, bioavailability, drug targeting, where co-administered P-gp inhibitors have additionally combat against developed MDR. Moreover, recent advancement in the stimuli-sensitive delivery of nanocarriers facilitates a tumor-targeted release of the chemotherapeutics to reduce the associated toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents in normal cells.

Structure, morphology and magnetic property of the prepared adsorbent were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The capacity of the adsorbent for removing heavy metals ions Pb(II), As(III) and Cd(II) was studied using Langmuir adsorption isotherm under ultrasound-assisted condition. The maximum adsorption capacities of Pb(II), As(III) and Cd(II) were found to be 147.05, 151.51 and 119.04 mg g-1, respectively. In addition to high adsorption capacity, this adsorbent shows advantages such as green synthesis, low cast, recyclability, and easy separation.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 04 28,"Hypoxia is common occurrence of the tumour microenvironment, wherein heterogeneous gradients of O2 give rise to tumoural cells which are highly malignant, metastatic, and resistant to therapeutic efforts. Thus, the assessment and imaging of hypoxia is essential for tumour diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging and, more specifically, the quantitative assessment of longitudinal relaxation time enhancement, was shown to enable the mapping of oxygen in tumours with increased sensitivity for lipids as compared to water signal. Unfortunately, this can only be applied to tumours with high lipid content. To overcome this issue, we propose the use of lipid nanocapsules (LNCs). LNCs have been demonstrated as excellent core-shell nanocarriers, wherein the lipidic-core is used for lipophilic drug encapsulation, enabling treatment of highly malignant tumours. Herein, however, we exploited the lipidic-core of the LNCs to develop a simple but effective technique to increase the lipidic content within tissues to enable the assessment and mapping of pO2. LNCs were prepared using the phase-inversion technique to produce 60 nm sized nanoparticles, and in vitro studies demonstrated the permeability and responsiveness of LNCs to O2. To evaluate the ability of LNCs to respond to changes in pO2in vivo, after a hyperoxic challenge, three animal models, namely a normal tissue model (gastrocnemius muscle tissue) and two tumour tissue models (subcutaneous fibrosarcoma and intracerebral glioblastoma) were explored.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 04 28,"As a chronic infectious disease, periodontitis is the main cause of teeth exfoliation due to its severe inflammatory reaction and periodontal tissue destruction. Recent reports have shown that baicalin could inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway in inflammatory activity of periodontitis, but the efficacy of baicalin is limited due to its poor water solubility. In this work, we report the fabrication and application of baicalin encapsulated D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles (PMs) through thin-film hydration method. The monodispersed micelles showed a spherical shape in aqueous solution and a prolonged drug-release kinetic. After baicalin was loaded into PMs, cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction were both decreased. The expression of genes (including TNF-α, IL-1β, RANKL and NF-κB) and the phosphorylation level of NF-κB p65 protein in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat gingival fibroblasts were also reduced. Further investigation of drug efficacy in a rat periodontal disease model confirmed that the use of baicalin-PMs could reduce the destruction of alveolar bone and gingival fiber. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of baicalin-PMs was significantly better than that of free baicalin. These results suggest that the direct injection of micelles containing water-insoluble drugs may become a simple but effective method for treating periodontitis.",In situ accurate deposition of electrospun medical glue fibers on kidney with auxiliary electrode method for fast hemostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029331,"Materials science & engineering.

Hydrogel matrix was modified with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide to supply cell adhesion sites. Collagen fibers were added into the hydrogel matrix to produce interconnected vessel-like channels via enzyme mediated degradation. In a bone-like model, the successful outspread morphology and intensive function expression of osteo-like cells and the formation of endothelial cells-lined channels were observed, suggesting it's flexible to functionalize extracellular matrix with vessel-like channels via the introduction of endothelial cells-laden fibers.

Other parameters such as swelling ratio, blood clotting activity, and biocompatibility of the films were also investigated. Besides, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of prepared samples were examined against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and a multi drug resistance Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a drug resistance bacterium strain. Interestingly, the designed quaternized chitosan film (even without silver nanoparticles) showed high antimicrobial activity against all tested microbial strains which is probably due to the presence of imidazolium moiety in the film matrix. Furthermore, all nanocomposites showed a potent antimicrobial activity. Generally, the results of cell proliferation and attachment with MTT assay and DAPI staining on HFFF cells, have proved the cytocompatibility nature of the nanocomposite films.

The photoluminescence of SS/PVA hydrogel indicated PVA was well blended with sericin. SS/PVA hydrogel showed excellent hydrophilicity and swelling behavior for its porous structure. PVA blending effectively improved the thermostability of sericin and enhanced the mechanical property of sericin, but did not affect the crystallinity of sericin and PVA. SS/PVA hydrogel exhibited the ability to load and release small molecule drugs and silver nanoparticles. Cytotoxicity and immuno-toxicity assays suggested the gentamicin loaded SS/PVA hydrogel had excellent cytocompatibility on mammalian cells. Bacterial inhibition assay and wound infection model demonstrated the gentamicin loaded SS/PVA hydrogel could effectively inhibit bacterial growth, thus maintain cells viability.

However, the interpretation of dMRI signal and validation of quantitative measurements of is challenging. One way to address these challenges is by using a standard reference material that can mimic tumour cell microstructure. There is a growing interest in using hollow polymeric microspheres, mainly prepared by multiple steps, as mimics of cells in healthy and diseased tissue. The present work reports on tumour cell-mimicking materials composed of hollow microspheres for application as a standard material in dMRI. These microspheres were prepared via one-step co-electrospraying process. The shell material was poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymers with different molecule weights and/or ratios of glycolic acid-to-lactic, while the core was polyethylene glycol (PEG) or ethylene glycol. The resultant co-electrosprayed products were characterised by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and synchrotron X-ray micro-CT. These products were found to have variable structures and morphologies, e.g. from spherical particles with/without surface hole, through beaded fibres to smooth fibres, which mainly depend on PLGA composition and core materials. Only the shell material of PLGA polymer with ester terminated, Mw 50,000-75,000 g mol-1, and lactide:glycolide 85:15 formed hollow microspheres via the co-electrospraying process using the core material of 8 wt% PEG/chloroform as the core. A water-filled test object (or phantom) was designed and constructed from samples of the material generated from co-electrosprayed PLGA microspheres and tested on a 7 T MRI scanner. The preliminary MRI results provide evidence that hollow PLGA microspheres can restrict/hinder water diffusion as cells do in tumour tissue, implying that the phantom may be suitable for use as a quantitative validation and calibration tool for dMRI.","Assessing the antioxidant, cytotoxic, apoptotic and wound healing properties of silver nanoparticles green-synthesized by plant extracts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029313,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 04 28,"We synthesized silver nanoparticles using thirty Chinese plant extracts via a green synthetic strategy. UV-visible spectra showed that the silver nanoparticles have an absorbance at 450 nm. Among the thirty extracts, seven extracts (Cratoxylum formosum, Phoebe lanceolata, Scurrula parasitica, Ceratostigma minus, Mucuna birdwoodiana, Myrsine africana and Lindera strychnifolia) exhibited the successful synthesis of silver nanoparticles. These seven extracts showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and reducing power than the other extracts. The silver nanoparticles synthesized using these seven extracts were mostly spherical with high colloidal stability. The cytotoxicity of these seven silver nanoparticle samples on human lung cancer cells (A549) was clearly higher than that of the extracts alone. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity was affected by the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the silver nanoparticles synthesized with Cratoxylum formosum and Mucuna birdwoodiana extracts resulted in apoptotic cell death in A549 cells. The wound healing activity observed by the cell scratch method on mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) suggested that the Lindera strychnifolia extract produced silver nanoparticles with decent activity.

The purpose of this work was to observe how covalently immobilized polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer molecules with different terminal chemical groups influenced serum protein adsorption and osteoblast behavior. To this end, fifth-generation PAMAM dendrimers were immobilized on silicon surfaces with an anhydride-containing silane coupling agent which results in positively charged terminal NH2-groups. Coatings with a net negative charge were generated by introduction of terminal CO2H- or CH3-groups. Surface characterization was performed by static and dynamic contact angle and zeta potential. The in vitro studies with human MG-63 osteoblastic cells focused on cell adhesion, morphology, cell cycle, apoptosis and actin formation within 24 h. This work demonstrated that cell growth was dependent on surface chemistry and correlated strongly with the surface free energy and charge of the material. The positively charged NH2 surface induced tight cell attachment with well-organized actin stress fibers and a well spread morphology. In contrast, CO2H- and CH3-functional groups provoked a decrease in cell adhesion and spreading and indicated higher apoptotic potential, although both were hydrophilic.

The CuFeS2 nanocrystals were synthesized through a simple heating-up approach and transferred into an aqueous phase using BSA in an ultrasonic-assisted microemulsion method. The as-prepared CuFeS2@BSA nanoparticles further conjugated with folic acid (FA) followed by attachment of Ce6 to form the Ce6:CuFeS2@BSA-FA nanohybrid with improved solubility and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and fluorescence.

The Ce6:CuFeS2@BSA-FA hybrid showed lower toxicity in vitro (HeLa and HepG2 cells) and in vivo (zebrafish embryos), while they are selectively recognized and internalized by HeLa cells that over-express folate receptors. Compared to each modality applied separately, the combined single-laser-induced PTT and PDT treatment showed the enhanced generation of heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with synergistic cancer killing under 671 nm laser irradiation (10 min, 1 W/cm2).

The PD-coated surfaces showed high sensitivity over a broad range of pH levels by switching reversibly zwitterionic states, which led to an excellent cellular resistance effect by inhibiting the attachment of nearly 95% of mammalian cells. Similarly, they exhibited a strong interaction with the negatively charged surfaces of bacteria, as observed in the fluorescence ON/OFF system. In addition, PD were employed to detect the attachment of mammalian and bacterial cells: we deposited PD on a screen-printed carbon electrode for cyclic voltammetry analysis. Notably, the presence of cells remarkably interfered with the current flow between the PD and the screen-printed carbon electrode surface by causing an impressive decline in both reduction-oxidation signals, implying the high sensitivity of the PD-coated surfaces to cells and bacteria in different pH environments. Therefore, as smart materials with high sensitivity, biocompatibility, selectivity, and accuracy, PD-coated surfaces represent a promising approach to visualizing and controlling biological cell attachment, thereby helping to avoid contamination in biomedical applications.",Engineering a multifunctional 3D-printed PLA-collagen-minocycline-nanoHydroxyapatite scaffold with combined antimicrobial and osteogenic effects for bone regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029308,"Materials science & engineering.

The addition of MH resulted in an adequate antibiotic release profile that by being compatible with local drug delivery therapy was translated into antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, a main pathogen associated to bone-related infections. Subsequently, the hMSCs response to these scaffolds revealed that the incorporation of cHA significantly stimulated the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenesis-related gene expression (RUNX2, OCN and OPN) of hMSCs. Furthermore, the association of a bioinspired material (cHA) with the antibiotic MH resulted in a combined effect of an enhanced osteogenic activity. These findings, together with the antibiofilm activity depicted strengthen the appropriateness of this 3D-printed PLA-Col-MH-cHA scaffold for future use in bone repair. By targeting bone repair while mitigating the typical infections associated to bone implants, our 3D scaffolds deliver an integrated strategy with the combined effects further envisaging an increase in the success rate of bone-implanted devices.",Core and biological motif of self-assembling peptide nanofiber induce a stronger electrostatic interaction than BMP2 with BMP2 receptor 1A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029307,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 04 28,"Recent studies suggest that nanotopography can trigger colocalization of integrins and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) receptors (e.g., BMPR1A), thereby leading to osteogenesis. In this study, the bone marrow homing peptide 1 (BMHP1) motif was bound to a self-assembling peptide core to form a hydrogel-based nanofiber (R-BMHP1). The docking and molecular dynamic study revealed that the R-BMHP1 sequence induced a stronger electrostatic interaction than BMP2 through arginines in the RADA core sequence and through lysine24 in the BMHP1 motif with BMPR1A. Notably, decrease of polar solvation binding energy will enhance the total binding energy and increases bone regeneration even more than BMP2 The enhanced osteogenesis and bone repair potential of R-BMHP1 nanofiber might be related to its chemical interaction with BMPR1A, which triggered downstream signal transduction through osteogenic genes overexpression in osteo-differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as well as implanted critical-sized bone defects in rats. Following that, calcium deposition occurred by osteoblast-like cells, ALP activity increased in osteodifferentiation MSCs and rat serum, and calcium density improved in bone defects (X-ray). The nanofiber was biocompatible and enhanced the cell viability of MSCs, without multinuclear cell infiltration into the defect site. Taking everything into account, not only does nanotopography induce osteogenesis through colocalization of BMPRs and integrins, but also R-BMHP1 nanofibers (considering their chemical structure) induce cell proliferation, osteogenesis, and bone repair through strong electrostatic interaction with BMPR1A and downstream signaling. The entire outcome of this study manifests the plausibility of R-BMHP1 for spine and spinal cord injury repair.",Pyrolysis preparation of poly-γ-glutamic acid derived amorphous carbon nitride for supporting Ag and γ-Fe2O3 nanocomposites with catalytic and antibacterial activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029306,"Materials science & engineering.

Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that Ag and γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were obtained in situ and homogeneously dispersed on the a-CN matrix. The average size of nanoparticles was 8.1 nm. The presence of γ-Fe2O3, Ag, and a-CN in the nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN catalyzed the degradation of methyl orange. This catalyst was also recycled ten times by magnetic separation without any loss in efficiency. Ag + γ-Fe2O3@a-CN exhibited strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. It also exhibited excellent antibacterial activity even after 20 times magnetic recycling. This indicates that this is a promising recyclable antibacterial and catalyst for environmental applications."

One hundred fifty-three patients were recruited and tested for classical AD CSF biomarkers- Amyloid-ß42 and tau proteins - and novel candidate biomarkers - neurofilament (NF-) light and microRNA (miR) -21, -125b, -146a, and -222.All dementia patients had significantly higher concentrations of NF-light compared to CNS, with the TP group displaying the highest NF-light values.

Of the four miRNAs analyzed, miR-222 levels were significantly increased in VD patients compared to both CNS and AD. In addition, while NF-light showed a better diagnostic performance than miR-222 and classical AD biomarkers in differentiating TP and VD from CNS, classical AD biomarkers revealed higher performance in discriminating AD from non-AD disorders.Overall, our results suggest that CSF NF-light and miR-222 are promising biomarkers that may help to diagnose non-AD disorders.",Identification and characterization of microRNAs in the gonad of Trachinotus ovatus using Solexa sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029056,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

To examine the potential regulatory mechanism of sexual differentiation, we conducted a microRNAs (miRNAs) analysis on the ovaries and testes of T. ovatus. A total of 13,423,691 and 11,734,953 raw reads, representing 91,883,908 and 86,879,726 unique sequences of 18-35 nt length obtained from the ovaries and testes, respectively.

However, there is still no uniform explanation of how the spatial code is formed in different dimensional spaces to date. The main reason why place cell exhibits unique activity pattern is that the animal needs to retrieve and process spatial information. In this paper, we constructed a constrained optimization model based on information theory to explain the place field formation across species in different dimensional spaces. We proposed the following question that, using only limited amount of neural energy, how to organize the spiking locations (place field) in the available environment to obtain the most efficient spatial information representation? We solved this conditional functional extremum problem by variational techniques. The results showed that on the condition of limited neural energy, the place field will comply with a Gaussian-form distribution automatically to convey the largest amount information per spike. We also found that the animal's natural habitat property and locomotion experience statistics affected the symmetry of spatial representation in different dimensions. These findings not only reconcile the argument of whether the spatial codes of place cell are isotropic, but also provide an explanation of place field formation by an information-theoretic approach. Furtherly, this research revealed the energy economical and information efficient properties underlie the spatial representation system of the brain."

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of corticosteroids on depression are yet to be elucidated. We found that fluoxetine reversed neurite growth inhibition induced by CORT in PC12 cells, a widely used model system for neurobiological and neurotoxicological studies. Transcriptome profiling showed that 1,609 genes were up-regulated, whereas 1,764 genes were down-regulated significantly in the CORT group in comparison with the Control group. Of them, the expression of 589 DEGs was reversed after fluoxetine treatment, and genes related to cell morphogenesis, neurite growth, and immune function were involved in the neuroprotective effect of fluoxetine against CORT. Furthermore, expression of neurite growth-related genes, such as such as Calpain 2 (Capn2), vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (Vamp7) and C-type natriuretic peptide (Cnp), altered in a brain region- or treatment-specific manner in the animal models of depression.

Subgroup analyses were conducted based on design, population, important potential confounders, and pollutants levels. We found a significantly increased risk of depression with long-term exposure to PM2.5 and short-term exposure to PM10, NO2, SO2, CO. No evidence was found in the association between exposure to O3 and depression. Besides, exposure to high levels of pollutants indicates a higher risk of depression.

It is a low cost and simple method and offers high throughput. However, this technique is limited to low voltages leading to slow separations. Producing the heat during the electrophoresis known as Joule heating inevitably leads to a rise in the gel temperature. For the first time, this work offers a whole gel temperature measurement by using a thermal camera which presents accurate temperature profiles in the gel with a resolution of more than 10 pixel/mm2 and a precision of 0.1 °C. Titania, TiO2, nanoparticles (NPs) were embedded into the polyacrylamide (PA) gel to improve the electrophoretic separation of proteins.

The synthesis conditions of SGO-CIP column were optimized by the response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions, this column showed high specificity to FLU, and the adsorption capacity reached 61.74 ng mg-1. The enrichment factor of the monolithic column was over 40-fold. Various factors affecting the extraction efficiency of SGO-CIP column during SPE were tested to achieve optimal enrichment and to reduce non-specific adsorption.

Understanding genes that participate in cancer progression and DNA damage response (DDR) may improve therapeutic strategies for TNBC. DAXX, a death domain-associated protein, has been reported to be critically involved in cancer progression and drug sensitivity in multiple cancer types. However, its role in breast cancer, especially for TNBC, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated a tumor suppressor function of DAXX in TNBC proliferation, colony formation, and migration. In Mouse Xenograft Models, DAXX remarkably inhibited tumorigenicity of TNBC cells. Mechanistically, DAXX could directly bind to the promoter region of RAD51 and impede DNA damage repair, which impacted the protection mechanism of tumor cells that much depended on remaining DDR pathways for cell growth. Furthermore, DAXX-mediated inefficient DNA damage repair could sensitize BRCA-proficient TNBC cells to PARP inhibitors. Additionally, we identified that dual RAD51 and PARP inhibition with RI-1 and ABT888 significantly reduced TNBC growth both in vitro and in vivo, which provided the first evidence of combining RAD51 and PARP inhibition in BRCA-proficient TNBC. In conclusion, our data support DAXX as a modulator of DNA damage repair and suppressor of TNBC progression to sensitize tumors to the PARP inhibitor by repressing RAD51 functions. These provide an effective strategy for a better application of PARP inhibition in the treatment of TNBC.",ATF6α Activation Enhances Survival against Chemotherapy and Serves as a Prognostic Indicator in Osteosarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029032,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 10,"Patients with metastatic or relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma (OS) have a 5-year survival rate of <30%. This has remained unchanged over several decades. One of the factors contributing to lack of improvement in survival is the development of chemoresistance. Hence, elucidating and targeting the mechanisms that promote survival against chemotherapy and lead to chemoresistance is pivotal to improving outcomes for these patients. We identified that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-activated transcription factor, ATF6α, is essential for the survival of OS cells against chemotherapy induced cell death. ATF6α cleavage and activity were enhanced in OS cells compared to normal osteoblasts and knockdown of ATF6α expression enhanced sensitivity of OS cells against chemotherapy induced cell death. This was in part due to increased Bax activation. Pharmacologic inhibition or knock-down of downstream targets of ATF6α, protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) and ERO1β, a thiol oxidase that is involved in the re-oxidation of PDIs also independently induced pronounced killing of OS cells following chemotherapy. Analysis of primary tumors from OS patients reveals that patients with high levels of nuclear ATF6α: (1) also had increased expression of its downstream targets the chaperone BiP and enzyme PDI, (2) had a significant likelihood of developing metastasis at diagnosis, (3) had significantly poorer overall and progression free survival, and (4) had poorer response to chemotherapy. These findings suggest that targeting survival signaling by the ATF6α pathway in OS cells may favor eradication of refractory OS tumor cells and ATF6α could be a useful predictor for chemo-responsiveness and prognosis."

The mechanism of action of tDCS is not understood, but preliminary work in healthy adults suggests it modulates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels to create an environment optimal for learning. It is unknown if this proposed mechanism translates to aging or neurodegenerative conditions. This study tested the hypothesis that tDCS reduces GABA at the stimulated tissue in PPA. We applied GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify GABA levels before and after a sham-controlled tDCS intervention with language therapy in PPA. All participants showed improvements but those receiving active tDCS showed significantly greater language improvements compared to sham both immediately after the intervention and at 2-month follow-up. GABA levels in the targeted tissue decreased from baseline after the intervention and remained decreased 2 months after the intervention.

To ascertain the long-term consequences of omega-3 (ω3) fatty acid deficiency during brain development on oxidative fatty acid degradation in the brain and the development of Alzheimer-like pathology, wild-type (WT) female mice were fed diets that were either replete or deficient in ω3 fatty acids for 5 weeks. These females were then mated with hemizygous 5xFAD male transgenic (TG) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, and the progeny were continued on diets that were either ω3-replete or ω3-deficient. When the progeny were 6 months of age, they received radiolabeled arachidonic acid (ARA) by intracerebroventricular injection. Five days after these injections, the brains were harvested and oxidative degradation of the radiolabeled ARA was characterized. Among the progeny of female mice on an ω3-replete diet, TG progeny had lower PSD-95 expression and higher oxidative ARA degradation than WT progeny. Progeny on an ω3-deficient diet, however, had no significant differences in PSD-95 expression between TG and WT mice, or in the extent of ARA degradation. In TG mice, an ω3-deficient diet reduced oxidative ARA degradation to a greater extent than in WT mice. The reductions in oxidative ARA degradation occurred even if the progeny of female mice on an ω3-deficient diet resumed an ω3-replete diet immediately on weaning. These results demonstrate that dietary ω3 fatty acid deficiency during development can cause long-term changes in the expression of a synaptic marker and long-term reductions in the rate of ARA degradation in the WT brain, which are not completely alleviated by an ω3-replete diet after weaning. The elimination of differences between TG and WT mice by an ω3-deficient diet suggests that mechanisms regulating PSD-95 expression and the oxidative degradation of ARA are related and that the timing of dietary ω3 intake during development may influence Alzheimer's disease-related pathological changes later in life.",Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (IBMSi011-A) from a patient with Parkinson's disease carrying LRRK2 p.I1371V mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029016,Stem cell research,2019 06 02,"Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the causative gene for autosomal-dominant familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rare phenomenon that can be associated with inflammatory vasculopathies such as polyarteritis nodosa, but the link between aneurysm formation and spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage in polyarteritis nodosa is unclear. We describe a case of a patient with polyarteritis nodosa and spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage following rupture of an aneurysm of the anterior spinal artery. Following operative washout and decompression of the subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal digital subtraction angiography was performed and revealed intimal contour irregularities, stenotic changes, and multiple small aneurysms in renal, hepatic, and bronchial arteries and some proximal spinal arteries, and, most notably, a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior spinal artery supplied directly by the artery of Adamkiewicz. Polyarteritis nodosa was subsequently diagnosed in light of these findings. Though previous cases have noted spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage in of the context of polyarteritis nodosa, we found no previously documented case of a definitive aneurysm of the anterior spinal artery in a case of polyarteritis nodosa documented on angiography. This case highlights the potential importance of monitoring for aneurysms of the spinal vasculature in cases of polyarteritis nodosa and in screening for vasculitides in cases of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Future studies are needed to describe patterns of the specific anatomic localization and incidence of spinal artery aneurysms in polyarteritis nodosa."

As part of our ongoing efforts in discovering potential bioactive compounds from G. repens, we have studied the isolation, identification, and quantification of a new class of cholinesterase inhibitor from G. repens for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Terpene was isolated from hydroalcohol extract of G. repens (GRHA) and its structure was identified ""Pentylcurcumene"" by spectroscopic data. HPTLC fingerprint analysis was performed and good separation was achieved in mobile phase (benzene:methanol; 7.5:2.5, v/v, 254 and 366 nm; Rf 0.51). The method was validated using ICH guidelines in terms of linearity, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, robustness and stability.

Evaluations encompassed thirteen years of trimming (i.e. 2005-2017) data and were performed for both backbone and lateral utility lines. Backbones included all three phase lines between a substation and a faultable device whereas all other lines were considered laterals. The study site spanned the entire state of Connecticut, where the dominant vegetation is temperate deciduous forest. We controlled for variations in weather, tree cover, and wire type, by pairing ETT-treated zones with nearby untreated zones. ETT-treated conductors had storm outage rates that were 0.07-0.36 outages/km/year lower than untreated conductors or 35-180% lower than the service-area's average annual outage rate for untreated conductors. ETT-treatment was associated with lower outage rates for ""minor"" outage types (i.e., blown fuse, tripped recloser, etc.) but the treatment effect was not statistically significant for ""major"" outage types (damaged poles or wires). System-wide ETT application, for the approximately 27,000 km of conductors in the study area, was predicted to reduce annual storm-related outages by an average of 81-104 and 318-759 outages/year for backbone and lateral lines, respectively.

Controlled low-strength material (CLSM) is a highly flowable cementitious backfill material with self-consolidating properties. The CLSM efficiency during construction and final performance at the site depends on its plastic properties. Plastic properties are responsible for workability, pumpability, stability, and lateral pressure on adjacent soils. This paper presents a critical review to date on the use of waste materials and/or by-products and their impacts on the plastic properties of the CLSM. Extensive previous studies demonstrated that the basic properties and content of waste materials as well as the amount of water in the mix design, play a dominant role in determining the plastic properties of CLSM. The discussed plastic properties of CLSM include flowability, bleeding, segregation, and hardening time, which are found to be inter-related. Proper mix design adjustment to accommodate the use of waste materials is possible to produce sustainable CLSM with acceptable plastic properties. Additionally, the discussion and analysis presented in this paper could provide a basis for future research advances and the development of sustainable CLSM prepared with waste materials.",Environmental footprint study of white rice production chain-case study: Northern of Iran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028968,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"Rice is globally counted as a highly important food. Among its production processes, paddy production, drying and whitening are energy-intensive that leave environmental impact. The study analyzes the environmental parameters (by SimaPro 8.1) for the growth of two rice paddy varieties (low-yield and high-yield) in three Northern provinces of Iran (Mazandaran, Guilan and Golestan) using two mechanized and traditional planting methods. The environmental impact of white rice production in milling plants and its drying using two dryers (modern and conventional) running on three different fuels (kerosene, diesel fuel and natural gas) was analyzed. Finally, the husking and whitening processes through three different systems (conventional, semi-modern and modern) were investigated. Results revealed that the highest environmental impact occurred when using the mechanized planting system to grow the low-yield variety in Mazandaran province (MC-LYV-MP). The lowest impact was observed in Guilan province when growing the high-yield variety using the traditional practice (TC-HYV-GiP). During the drying process, the largest adverse environmental effects (mechanized harvesting, high-yield variety, and conventional drying) were found to be 1.92 times higher than their lowest level (traditional harvesting, low yield variety and conventional dryer) using kerosene and 4.73, and 5.59 times higher than their lowest level (traditional harvesting, low yield variety, and modern drying) using diesel fuel, and natural gas, respectively. The processing (husking and whitening) results also suggested that the use of modern systems exacerbated the environmental impact by 1.42 (low-yield variety) and 1.53 (high-yield variety) compared to the traditional paddy processing methods.",Quality and content analysis of fundus images using deep learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028967,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 05 22,"Automatic retinal image analysis has remained an important topic of research in the last ten years.

The method begins with a deep learning-based classification that identifies the image quality in terms of sharpness, illumination and homogeneity, followed by an unsupervised second stage that evaluates the field definition and content in the image. Using the inter-database cross-validation technique, our proposed method achieved overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of above 90% when tested on 7007 images collected from seven different public databases, including our own developed database-the UoA-DR database. Therefore, our proposed method is generalised and robust, making it more suitable than alternative methods for adoption in clinical practice."

Four filters were filled with 10 cm gravel of which a layer of medium size gravel (5 cm thickness, aggregate size 20-40 mm) at the bottom and a layer of coarse gravel (5 cm thickness, aggregate size 10-20 mm) at the top, then filled with 20 cm sand (d60 = 0.2 mm, d10 = 0.118 mm). Finally, Vermifilter 1 (VF1), control unit and Vermifilter 2 (VF2), were filled with 40 cm fine sawdust (0.05-5 mm) but Vermifilter 3 (VF3), was filled with 40 cm cow dung (0.05-5 mm). Three filters were inoculated with 200 individuals of Eudrilus eugeniae except for the control unit which was filled with sawdust. Five sampling ports were installed on the wall of the filters at 10 cm intervals with reference to the surface of the top layer. Three of the filters were supplied with concentrated greywater and VF1 was supplied with drinking water at the hydraulic loading rate of 16 L m-2.d-1 on batch basis, i.e., four times a day at 8:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Weekly, samples from influent and effluent, and monthly, samples of filter materials collected via sampling ports, were collected and analyzed.The removal efficiencies of biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD), and dissolved chemical oxygen demand (dCOD) of VF2 and VF3 were 5-7% higher than the control unit, but little differences were observed in terms of total suspended solids (TSS). However, the removal efficiencies of nutrients for the control unit was slightly better than VF2 and VF3. The pH and Moisture content (MC) of filter materials increased along the depth, but percentage of volatile solids to total solids (VS/TS) decreased through time due to the high number of microbial communities and earthworms dominating the top layer compared to the bottom. The performance of VF2-sawdust was slightly better than VF3-cow dung to treat concentrated greywater.",Improvement of polyvinyl chloride nanofiltration membranes by incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes modified with triethylenetetramine to use in treatment of dye wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028955,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"Multiwalled carbon nanotubes modified with triethylenetetramine (TETA) as an organic nanofiller was used in fabrication of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanofiltration membranes. The membranes were prepared by the phase separation method and immersion precipitation technique. For this purpose, various percentages of the TETA-MWCNTs were added to the casting solutions and the membrane films were formed and placed in a bath water. In order to identify the membranes and their properties, SEM images, contact angle and FTIR-ATR analyses were taken from the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The membranes performance in terms of water/protein/dye permeability, protein rejection and Lanasol blue 3R dye rejection were investigated. Establishing hydrogen bond between the water molecules and the functional groups of MWCNTs enhanced the hydrophilicity of the fabricated membranes and caused an increase in permeability. The permeability in the membrane containing 0.25 wt% of TETA-MWCNTs reached its highest value, and adding more amounts reduced flux by blocking the membrane pores. There was also a significant decrease in the rate of membrane fouling for the hybrid membranes. Flux recovery ratio reached from 62.2% to 76.1%. Also, rejection of BSA and Lanasol blue 3R combination dye was increased for the modified membranes.",Porous carbons derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste for CO2 capture studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028953,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"Oxygen augmented carbon adsorbent has been developed using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste by first carbonizing at different temperatures (500-800 °C) and then chemically activating using different ratios of KOH: PET (mass ratio 1 to 4). The textural characterization divulges the effect of activation in terms of the development of the high surface area and micropore volume of 1690 m2 g-1 and 0.78 cm3 g-1 respectively, for the optimum sample (PET-3-700). Elemental analysis of PET-3-700 illustrates the presence of 34.33% oxygen and XPS results confirmed the occurrence of oxygen moieties which enhance the basicity of the adsorbent and promote CO2 capture. The CO2 adsorption capacity of prepared carbons was determined thermogravimetrically under dynamic conditions, at different concentrations of CO2 (6-100%) and temperatures. The maximum CO2 uptake capacity of 2.31 mmol g-1 was exhibited by PET-3-700 at an adsorption temperature of 30 °C under 100% pure CO2 flow. Four adsorption-desorption cycles corroborate almost complete regenerability of the prepared adsorbent. Adsorption kinetics at all adsorption conditions was described best by fractional order kinetic model. Freundlich isotherm fit indicates the surface of adsorbent being heterogeneous and low values of isosteric heat shows physisorption behavior of the process. Negative values of thermodynamic parameters indicate exothermic and feasible nature of adsorption process.",Diagnosis of soil contamination using microbiological indices: A review on heavy metal pollution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028952,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"Heavy metal contamination of soil has become a serious global issue because of their persistence in the environment and the non-biodegradable nature leading to their accumulation to toxic levels. In order to achieve early warning and prevent soil quality from deteriorating, it is necessary to select suitable indices to diagnose heavy metal pollution. Microbiological indices for monitoring soil pollution by heavy metals are gaining attention. However, the related researches are scattered, and critical review is imperative. This review is mainly to provide readers with an in-depth understanding of the merits and limitations of microbiological indices for heavy metals contaminated and remediated soils. Microbiological indicators include microbial abundance, community diversity and structure, functional activity. The changes of different microbiological indices and the mechanism of microbial response to heavy metal stress in soils are comprehensively summarized. Furthermore, research gaps and future directions of the microbial ecotoxicological diagnosis of soil contamination by heavy metals are also proposed and discussed.",Split phosphorus fertiliser applications as a strategy to reduce incidental phosphorus losses in surface runoff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028951,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"Organic soils have low sorption capacities for phosphorus (P), and may pose a risk of P loss to water if P applications to these soils coincide with runoff events. Little is known about the magnitude of exports of P in overland flow following application of P fertiliser onto these soils, or on the influence of the frequency on P losses and persistence. The number of P fertiliser applications was surveyed across 39 commercial farms to assess current practice and inform the design of a rainfall runoff experiment to evaluate the effect of frequency of P applications on losses and persistence across time. Superphosphate (16% P) was applied in single (equivalent to 30 and 55 kg P ha-1 applied at day 0) and split (equivalent to 15 and 27.5 kg P ha-1 applied in two doses at days 0 and 55) applications to an organic soil inclined at a slope of 6% in a rainfall simulator experiment. The surface runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) was measured in controlled 30-min rainfall simulations conducted intermittently over an 85-day period. The DRP losses in surface runoff after the first rainfall event were 44.6 and 97.8 mg L-1 for single applications of 30 and 55 kg ha-1, respectively, and 13.3 and 21.8 mg L-1 for the same rates split in two doses, indicating that single P applications had disproportionately bigger impacts on losses than split applications. This supports the idea that frequent, but smaller, P applications can minimise the impact of fertilisation on waters. Dissolved reactive P concentrations remained significantly higher than those from the control samples until the end the experiment for almost all the P treatments, highlighting the long-lasting effects of added P and the elevated risk of P losses on organic soils. For climates with frequent rainfall events, which are likely to coincide with fertiliser applications, smaller but more frequent P applications can reduce the risk of P transfer as opposed to one single application.",Biodegradation of tannery dye effluent using Fenton's reagent and bacterial consortium: A biocalorimetric investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028950,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 17,"The impact caused by dye effluent discharge on the environment is well known. The study explores a hybrid method of combining Fenton oxidation with biological treatment by a defined bacterial consortium for the biodegradation of an effluent containing toxic azo dye (acid blue 113). In actual treatment process, the fluctuation in toxic load and presence of other dyeing chemical inhibits the activity of the bacterial consortium. An effective pre-treatment of effluent would ensure the optimal degradation irrespective of its initial load. The pre-treatment of dye effluent with Fenton (H2O2 & Fe2+), considerably reduced the dye concentration by 40% and a maximum dye degradation of 85% (i.e., 45% by biodegradation) was achieved in shake flask. The biodegradation process was investigated in a bioreaction calorimeter (BioRc1e), the heat profile, bioenergetics data along with CER (Carbon dioxide emission rate) and OUR (Oxygen uptake rate) provided vital information for the effective commercial scale up. Enhanced degradation of up to 97% was achieved in BioRc1, the CER and OUR profile follows the power-time profile alluding that the heat generated is the resultant effect of bacterial metabolic activity. In real dye bath effluent the Fenton pre-oxidized biodegradation reaction showed a degradation efficacy of 89.5% and considerable COD reduction of 93.7%. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed a better bacterial cell proliferation in pre-treated experiment and gas chromatography and mass spectrum analysis were used for prediction of metabolites. The unique combination of Fenton and the microbial consortia is a competitive technology for industrial effluent treatment processes.","A scoping review of simulation modeling in built environment and physical activity research: Current status, gaps, and future directions for improving translation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028948,Health & place,2019 06 04,"Existing reviews have suggested that simulation studies of physical activity and environments are an emerging area, but none have explored findings in this area systematically. We used a scoping review framework to assess the use of simulation modeling to inform decision-making about built environment influences on physical activity. A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple databases in January 2018. Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies evaluated interventions and features that were related to neighborhood safety (crime or traffic), active transportation, land use design, and walking and biking infrastructure. All of the studies focused on urban areas and most considered heterogeneity of outcomes based on local context. The majority of studies (70%) did not appear to have engaged or been used by practitioners or policy-makers to inform real-world decisions. There has been a growth of simulation modeling studies, but there remain gaps. The studies evaluated built environment interventions that have been recommended by expert panels, but more were of interventions related to active transportation; few considered recommended interventions to support recreational activity. Furthermore, studies have all focused on urban settings and there is a need to consider non-urban settings and how heterogeneity could reduce or exacerbate health disparities. More work to involve and evaluate practices for engaging stakeholders in model development and interpretation is also needed to overcome the translation of simulation research to practice gap, and realize its potential impact on the built environment and physical activity.","Link between Endometriosis, Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, and the Health of Women Midlife.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028947,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 05 26,"Endometriosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are both essentially diseases of inflammation. It is well established that inflammation is the leading mechanism in the initiation and maintenance of vascular injury and in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, if women with endometriosis do indeed have increased general inflammation, they are at increased risk of developing microvascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Currently available evidence suggests that young female patients with proven endometriosis may be at a higher lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular disease; this may be unrecognized due to the relatively young age of women found to have endometriosis. Other mechanisms proposed to explain the link between endometriosis and ASCVD include similarities in the genetic underpinnings of each condition, including microRNA dysfunction and the association between endometriosis and early menopause, a risk for developing ASCVD. Although physicians today primarily focus on traditional risk factors when evaluating an individual female patient's risk of developing ASCVD, we believe that a history of endometriosis should be included as a possible risk factor and needs further exploration. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking endometriosis with ASCVD will hopefully guide the implementation of new therapies to mitigate the increased cardiovascular disease burden that patients with endometriosis might face.","Proteomic analysis of bacterial response to a 4-hydroxybenzylidene indolinone compound, which re-sensitizes bacteria to traditional antibiotics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028946,Journal of proteomics,2019 05 25,"Halogenated 4-hydroxybenzylidene indolinones have been shown to re-sensitize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) to methicillin and vancomycin respectively. The mechanism of antibiotic re-sensitization was however not previously studied. Here, we probe the scope of antibiotic re-sensitization and present the global proteomics analysis of S. aureus treated with GW5074, a 4-hydroxybenzylidene indolinone compound. With a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 μg/mL against S. aureus, GW5074 synergized with beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin, carbenicillin and cloxacillin, the DNA synthesis inhibitor, ciprofloxacin, the protein synthesis inhibitor, gentamicin and the folate acid synthesis inhibitor, trimethoprim. Global proteomics analysis revealed that GW5074 treatment resulted in significant downregulation of enzymes involved in the purine biosynthesis. S. aureus proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and peptide transport were also observed to be downregulated. Interestingly, anti-virulence targets such as AgrC (a quorum sensing-related histidine kinase), AgrA (a quorum sensing-related response regulator) as well as downstream targets, such as hemolysins, lipases and proteases in S. aureus were also downregulated by GW5074. We observed that the peptidoglycan hydrolase, SceD was significantly upregulated. The activity of GW5074 on S. aureus suggests that the compound primes bacteria for the antibacterial action of ineffective antibiotics. SIGNIFICANCE: Antibiotic resistance continues to present significant challenges to the treatment of bacterial infections. Given that antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon and that it has become increasingly difficult to discover novel antibiotics, efforts to improve the activity of existing agents are worth pursuing. A few small molecules that re-sensitize resistant bacteria to traditional antibiotics have been described but the molecular details that underpin how these compounds work to re-sensitize bacteria remain largely unknown. In this report, global label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify changes in the proteome that occurs when GW5074, a compound that re-sensitize MRSA to methicillin, is administered to S. aureus. The identification of pathways that are impacted by GW5074 could help identify novel targets for antibiotic re-sensitization.",Hormonal stimulation of carp is accompanied by changes in seminal plasma proteins associated with the immune and stress responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028945,Journal of proteomics,2019 05 25,"Hormonal stimulation in common carp is a routine practice to enhance sperm production and control gamete maturation. This study aimed to compare the proteome of carp seminal plasma between control and Ovopel-induced males using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis. Ovopel induction increased sperm volume, total sperm count, seminal plasma osmolality, and pH and decreased seminal plasma protein concentration. In total, 36 spots were identified (23 up- and 13 downregulated), corresponding to 23 proteins differentially abundant in seminal plasma after Ovopel induction (p < .05; fold change 1.2). The majority of proteins were associated with the immune and stress responses including the transport protein (hephaestin), antiproteases (fetuin, α2-macroglobulin, TIMP2), complement components (C3, complement factor B/C2A), regulator of the coagulation cascade (plasminogen), modulators of the innate immune response, such as intelectin, ApoA and ApoE, and the cathepsin/cystatin system, and stress response (enolase1). In addition, hormonal stimulation seems to be related to the proteins involved in lipid metabolism, signal transduction, and tissue remodeling. Our results suggest that hormonal stimulation is not just concomitant with the hydration of testis but also induces the synthesis and secretion of seminal plasma proteins involved in sperm maturation and protection against stress induced by administration of the exogenous hormone. SIGNIFICANCE: It is well known that hormonal stimulation of male fish induces the final maturation of spermatozoa. However, molecular and biochemical basis underlying hormone-induced changes in semen is unknown at present. This study for the first time reveals, using proteomic approach, that hormonal stimulation in addition to hydration of testis is accompanied by significant changes in seminal plasma proteins related mainly to immune and stress response, lipid metabolism, signal transduction and tissue remodeling. These changes are associated with gene expression and synthesis and secretion of seminal plasma proteins by reproductive tissues. Overall, our results provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanism responsible for hormonal stimulation in the reproductive tract of fish males."

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"Given the absorbability of nZnO and its inevitable coexistence with trace metals such as Cd and Pb in coastal environment, nZnO can adsorb these pollutants thereby affecting their distribution in different media of marine ecosystem. The marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus was applied in the present study to investigate the combined effect of nZnO and Cd or Pb on mortality and reproduction in marine organisms. For acute exposure, presence of 1.0 mg/L nZnO increased the toxicity of both Cd and Pb, as their LC50 decreased from 5.9 and 75.4 mg/L to 3.95 and 48.0 mg/L, respectively. For 21 d chronic exposure, the reproduction of the copepod was influenced by Cd and Pb at environmental relevant concentrations, and the interaction between nZnO and Cd or Pb appeared to be antagonistic. The waterborne Cd and Pb concentration was affected by nZnO for neither acute nor chronic exposure, indicating no adsorption of these two metals to nZnO at relative low concentration. The overall findings of this study suggested the binary exposure to nZnO/Cd or nZnO/Pb might have potential different toxic mechanisms between acute and chronic exposure.",Pharmacological and transcriptomic characterization of the nitric oxide pathway in aortic rings isolated from the tortoise Chelonoidis carbonaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028932,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"In this study the nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) pathway was characterized in tortoise Chelonoidis carbonaria aorta. Concentration response curves (CCR) to ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine and histamine were performed in the presence and absence of L-NAME in aorta pre-contracted with ACh (3 μM). CCR to SNP, BAY 41-2272 (sGC stimulator), BAY 60-2770 (sGC activator) and tadalafil (PDE-5 inhibitor) were constructed in the presence and absence of ODQ (10 μM). ATP (pEC50 6.1 ± 0.1), ADP (pEC50 6.0 ± 0.2), AMP (pEC50 6.8 ± 0.1) and histamine (pEC50 6.8 ± 0.12) relaxed Chelonoidis aorta and the addition of L-NAME reduced their efficacy (p < .05). Adenosine effects (pEC50 6.6 ± 0.1) were not changed in the presence of L-NAME.

The addition of ODQ reduced the SNP and tadalafil maximum response (p < .05) and promoted 63 fold right shift on BAY 41-2272 curve. In contrast, no alteration was observed on BAY 60-2770 response. Transcriptomic analysis for eNOS and sGC were found in aorta and brain libraries with high homology when compared with human transcripts. The NO-sGC-PDE-5 is functionally present in Chelonoidis aorta with a functional and genomic similarity to mammalian vessels. Unlike most of mammalian vessels, ACh did not cause endothelium-dependent relaxation in Chelonoidis carbonaria aortic rings.","Inhibitory effect of cadmium exposure on digestive activity, antioxidant capacity and immune defense in the intestine of yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028931,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that can pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms. To evaluate the physiological response and defense mechanism of fish intestine to Cd toxicity, yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) were exposed to 0 (control), 50 μg/L and 200 μg/L Cd2+ for a period of 8 weeks, and then histological changes, digestive activity, antioxidant status and immune responses in the anterior intestine were assessed. After exposure, significant growth retardation and Cd accumulation were observed, and obvious histopathological lesions in the intestine such as increased goblet cells, excessive mucus, vacuolization and thickened lamina propria were detected. Intestinal digestive enzymes activities and related gene expression were inhibited markedly in Cd2+ treatments. Furthermore, Cd exposure induced oxidative stress inhibiting antioxidant activity, characterized by an increase in malondialdehyde level as well as the decrease in the activity and transcription level of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, exposure to Cd2+ down-regulated the expression of key genes involved in the immune response (lys, c3, tor, tgf-β, il-10, tnf-α and il-8), suggesting immune defense was inhibited. Taken together, the decreased digestive enzyme activity and Cd-induced toxicity stress for antioxidant and immune systems in the intestine might be account for individual growth retardation.",Single and combined exposures of waterborne Cu and Cd induced oxidative stress responses and tissue injury in female rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028930,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"Copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) are two kinds of abundant toxic metals in aquatic ecosystem. The present study evaluated the effects of waterborne Cu and Cd on oxidative stress responses and histological alterations in female rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus). Fish were exposed for 7 days to: (i) control (no added Cu or Cd), (ii) waterborne Cu (39.2 μg L-1), (iii) waterborne Cd (299.6 μg L-1), and (iv) Cu and Cd in mixture (19.6 and 149.8 μg L-1, respectively). Antioxidant enzyme activities and gene mRNA abundance in fish tissues (gills, liver, and ovaries) were induced by Cu and Cd exposures, both individually and in mixture, at day 1, but an asynchronous response was observed between most enzyme activities and gene mRNA abundance following 7 days exposure. Biochemical analysis and histological observation indicated that exposure to Cu and Cd, alone and in combination, caused evident damage to lipids and tissue structure in gills, liver and ovaries. Comparing with single Cu or Cd exposure, Cu and Cd co-exposure induced greater increase in the mRNA expression of most antioxidant genes and caused more severe lesions in fish tissues, which suggested that exposure to waterborne Cu and Cd in mixture might increase their individual toxicity. Furthermore, positive relationships between nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) expression and expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) were also observed in the present study, which suggested that Cu or/and Cd induced expression of these antioxidant genes were might through activation of Nrf2.",Diphenyl diselenide dietary supplementation protects against methylmercury-chloride-induced immunotoxicity in the head kidney and spleen of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) via regulation of purinergic signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028929,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"This study aimed to evaluate whether dietary supplementation with diphenyl diselenide (Ph2Se2) would prevent the impaired immune and inflammatory responses elicited by methylmercury chloride (CH3HgCl) via protective effects on purinergic signaling in fish immune organs. Tissue and lymphocytic nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) activity for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was downregulated in the head kidney and spleen of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) exposed to CH3HgCl. Concomitantly, adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity was upregulated. Further, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLRP3) inflammasome gene expression was upregulated in the spleen and head kidney of CH3HgCl-exposed grass carp. Dietary supplementation with Ph2Se2 ameliorated these CH3HgCl-mediated alterations on purinergic enzymes, and their activities returned to baseline levels (except NTPDase activity for ADP). Based on these results, purinergic signaling in immune organs and lymphocytes can be considered a pathway linked to pro-inflammatory effects during exposure to environmental CH3HgCl concentrations, which may contribute to mortality of the affected fish. Since dietary supplementation with 3 mg Ph2Se2/kg in the feed prevented the CH3HgCl-induced alterations, it can be considered a potential suitable treatment to prevent impaired immune and inflammatory responses caused by Hg.","Mito-targeted ""turn-on"" fluorescent probe for nickel (II) detection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028928,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2019 04 30,"In this paper, we unveil a new highly selective and sensitive mito-tracker (NiP) for Ni2+ detection.

Previous research has shown that electrical signals recorded from the human brain track evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; O'Connell et al., 2012; Philiastides et al., 2014). In this study we directly tested the hypothesis that the latency of the N200 recorded by EEG (a negative peak occurring between 150 and 275 ms after stimulus presentation in human participants) reflects the visual encoding time (VET) required for completion of figure-ground segregation before evidence accumulation. We show that N200 latencies vary across individuals, are modulated by external visual noise, and increase response time by x milliseconds when they increase by x milliseconds, reflecting a linear regression slope of 1. Simulations of cognitive decision-making theory show that variation in human response times not related to evidence accumulation (non-decision time; NDT), including VET, are tracked by the fastest response times. Evidence that VET is tracked by N200 latencies was found by fitting a linear model between trial-averaged N200 latencies and the 10th percentiles of response times, a model-independent estimate of NDT. Fitting a novel neuro-cognitive model of decision making also yielded a slope of 1 between N200 latency and model-estimated NDT in multiple visual noise conditions, indicating that N200 latencies track the completion of visual encoding and the onset of evidence accumulation. The N200 waveforms were localized to the cortical surface at distributed temporal and extrastriate locations, consistent with a distributed network engaged in figure-ground segregation of the target stimulus.",The inhibition of automatic imitation: A meta-analysis and synthesis of fMRI studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028924,NeuroImage,2019 05 27,"Humans copy other people without their conscious awareness, a behaviour known as automatic imitation. Although automatic imitation forms a key part of daily social interactions, we do not copy other people indiscriminately. Instead, we control imitative tendencies by prioritising some actions and inhibiting others. To date, neuroimaging studies investigating the control of automatic imitation have produced inconsistent findings. Some studies suggest that imitation control relies on a domain-specific neural circuit related to social cognition (the theory-of-mind network). In contrast, other studies show engagement of a domain-general neural circuit that is engaged during a diverse range of cognitive control tasks (the multiple demand network). Given the inconsistency of prior findings, in the current paper we avoided problems associated with interpreting individual studies by performing a meta-analysis. To do so, we used a multi-level kernel density analysis to quantitatively identify consistent patterns of activation across functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating the control of imitation. Our results show clear and consistent evidence across studies that the control of automatic imitation is guided by brain regions in the multiple demand network including dorsolateral frontoparietal cortex. In contrast, there was only limited evidence that regions in the theory of mind network were engaged. Indeed, medial prefrontal cortex showed no consistent engagement and right temporoparietal junction engagement may reflect spatial rather than imitative control. As such, the current meta-analysis reinforces the role of domain-general control mechanisms and provides limited evidence in support of the role of domain-specific processes in regulating imitative tendencies. Consequently, neurocognitive models of imitation need updating to place more emphasis on domain-general control mechanisms, as well as to consider more complex organisational structures of control, which may involve contributions from multiple cognitive systems."

In addition to this functional connection, the two organelles are also tightly linked due to the fact that the ER is the birthplace of LDs. LDs have an atypical architecture, consisting of a neutral lipid core that is covered by a phospholipid monolayer. LD biogenesis starts with neutral lipid synthesis in the ER membrane and formation of small neutral lipid lenses between its leaflets, followed by budding of mature LDs toward the cytosol. Several ER proteins have been identified that are required for efficient LD formation, among them seipin, Pex30, and FIT2. Recent evidence indicates that these LD biogenesis factors might cooperate with specific lipids, thus generating ER subdomains optimized for LD assembly. Intriguingly, LD biogenesis reacts dynamically to nutrient stress, resulting in a spatial reorganization of LD formation in the ER.",CIDEA and CIDEC are regulated by CREB and are not induced during fasting in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella adipocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028911,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 06 11,"Cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor 45-like effector family proteins, including CIDEA, CIDEB and CIDEC, play an important role in energy metabolism. In the present study, CIDEA, CIDEB and CIDEC cDNAs were firstly isolated and characterized from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, encoding peptides of 205, 208 and 238 amino acids, respectively. Analysis of the exon-intron structures clarified that grass carp CIDEA, CIDEB and CIDEC consisted of 5 coding exons, 5 coding exons and 6 coding exons, respectively, which is similar with human and mouse. Both CIDE family genes mRNAs were expressed in a wide range of tissues, but the abundance of each CIDE family gene mRNA showed the tissue-dependent expression patterns. Time-course analysis of CIDE family expressions indicated that their expression were enhanced significantly from day 0 to day 8 after differentiation. Forskolin caused an increase in CIDEA and CIDEC expression, and the effects were attenuated by treatment with CREB inhibitor, revealing that CIDEA and CIDEC are regulated by CREB. Further study found that CIDEA and CIDEC mRNA levels did not show significant changes during fasting. These results provide the groundwork to elucidate the gene structure and physiological function of CIDE family in fish.","Synergistic effects of laminin-1 peptides, VEGF and FGF9 on salivary gland regeneration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028910,Acta biomaterialia,2019 06 10,"Hyposalivation is associated with radiation therapy, Sjögren's syndrome and/or aging, and is a significant clinical problem that decreases oral health and overall health in many patients and currently lacks effective treatment. Hence, methods to regenerate salivary glands and restore saliva secretion are urgently needed. To this end, this study describes the modification of fibrin hydrogels with a combination of laminin-1 peptides (YIGSR and A99) and human growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 9) to enhance regeneration in a salivary gland injury mouse model. Our results indicate that these fortified hydrogels enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis while promoting formation of acinar structures, thereby leading to enhanced saliva secretion. Such functional recovery indicates salivary gland regeneration and suggests that our technology may be useful in promoting gland regeneration and reversing hyposalivation in a clinical setting. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We engineered Fibrin Hydrogels (FH) to contain multiple regenerative cues including laminin-1 peptides (L1p) and growth factors (GFs). L1p and GF modified FH were used to induce salivary gland regeneration in a wounded mouse model. Treatment with L1p and GF modified FH promoted salivary epithelial tissue regeneration, vascularization, neurogenesis and healing as compared to L1p-FH or FH alone. Results indicate that L1p and GF modified FH can be used for future therapeutic applications.",Fracture modes and hybrid toughening mechanisms in oscillated/twisted plywood structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028909,Acta biomaterialia,2019 05 18,"Twisted or oscillated plywood structure can be often found in biological composites such as claws of lobsters, bone of mammals, dactyl club of mantis shrimps, and exoskeleton of beetles, which exhibits a combination of high stiffness, high fracture toughness and low density. However, there lacks a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the fracture toughness of the composite and its internal geometry. In this article, we propose that a combination of crack tilting and crack bridging determines the effective fracture toughness of the fiber-reinforced composite with the plywood structure. During the fracturing process, a crack plane initially propagates in the matrix-fiber interface following the twisted fiber alignment. Such crack tilting mechanism can significantly enlarge the area of cracking surface and thus enhance the effective fracture toughness of the composite. With the propagation of the tilted crack plane, the local energy release rate becomes too small to maintain the growth of the tilted crack plane, leading the crack to grow into the matrix, crossing the fibers. Because of the high strength of the fiber, a few fibers can maintain unbroken behind the crack tip, corresponding to crack bridging mechanism. Based on our quantitative analysis, it is found that the effective fracture toughness of the composite can be maximized for a certain pitch angle of the oscillated/twisted plywood structure, which agrees well with experiments. STATEMENTS OF SIGNIFICANCE: Fiber-reinforced composites can be widely found in nature and engineering applications. Recently, it has been discovered that many fiber-reinforced composites in biology have twisted or oscillated plywood structure with high fracture toughness, high mechanical stiffness and low density. Detailed experiments have indicated that an optimal pitch angle may exist for the plywood structure to maximize the fracture toughness of the composites. However, there lacks a quantitative model of revealing such pitch angle-dependent fracture toughness. In this work, we propose a hybrid toughening mechanism and predict the optimal pitch angle in twisted/oscillated plywood structure for maximizing the fracture toughness. Our predictions agree reasonably well with experimental results. As such, the theory may help the design of better fiber-reinforced composites.","Micro-injection molded, poly(vinyl alcohol)-calcium salt templates for precise customization of 3D hydrogel internal architecture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028908,Acta biomaterialia,2019 05 05,"In tissue engineering applications, sacrificial molding of hydrogel monoliths is a versatile technique for creating 3D molds to control tissue morphology. Previous sacrificial templates fabricated by serial processes such as solvent casting and thermal extrusion/fiber drawing can be used to effectively mold internal geometries within rapidly polymerizing, bulk curing hydrogels. However, they display poorer performance in controlling the geometry of diffusion limited, ionically cross-linked hydrogels, such as alginate. Here, we describe the use of poly(vinyl alcohol)-calcium salt templates (PVOH-Ca) fabricated by micro-injection molding, a parallel mass-production process, to conveniently cast internal geometries within both bulk curing hydrogels and ionically cross-linked alginate hydrogels. Calcium salt solubility was discovered to be a critical factor in optimizing the polymer composite's manufacturability, mechanical properties, and the quantity of calcium released upon template dissolution. Metrological and computed tomography (CT) analysis showed that the template's calcium release enables precise casting of microscale channel geometries within alginate hydrogels (6.4 ± 7.2% average error). Assembly of modular PVOH-Ca templates to mold 3D channel networks within alginate hydrogels is presented to demonstrate engineering scalability. Moreover, the platform is used to create hydrogel molds for engineering human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neuroepithelial organoids of a microscale, biomimetic cylindrical morphology. Thus, injection molded PVOH-Ca templates facilitate customization of hydrogel sacrificial molding, which can be used to generate 3D hydrogels with complex internal microscale architecture for diverse tissue engineering applications.

However, the enormous challenges are to improve their rapid corrosion excessively as well as to endow them with biocompatibility and biosafety. Herein, we introduce a natural silk fibroin protein coating to control the corrosion resistance and enhance the biocompatibility of MgZnCa alloy. To obtain a robust and reliable coated structure, different surface-activation processes are employed to increase the available functional groups on MgZnCa surfaces before coating. Compared to oxygen plasma activation, our unique vacuum ultraviolet-ozone (VUV/O3) activation method is effective in realizing uniform silk fibroin films as a protective barrier on MgZnCa alloy surfaces, and the nanoscratch test verified the superior adhesion strength of the silk fibroin-coated magnesium alloy structure. Long-term immersion results combined with electrochemical tests showed the preferable in vitro anticorrosion behavior and a low degradation rate of coated Mg alloy (1/8 times that of uncoated Mg alloy). Cell adhesion and cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that silk fibroin-coated MgZnCa presented improved biocompatibility with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. An animal study involving silk fibroin-coated MgZnCa implanted on one side of a rabbit spine for 180 days showed remarkably improved in vivo corrosion resistance, with 1/18 times the degradation rate of uncoated MgZnCa. These results not only comprehensively confirmed the validity of the VUV/O3-activation method as a coating strategy but also implied the tremendous potential of the modified Mg alloy for application as a degradable biomedical implant material. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: MgZnCa alloy is a promising material in clinical implantation. Silk fibroin (SF) is a natural organic material with biocompatibility and biodegradability. To date, the combination of SF and MgZnCa alloy has exhibited considerable prospects for orthopedic applications. The realization of a direct coating is an enormous challenge because strong chemical bonds cannot be easily formed between organic and inorganic materials. To solve this bottleneck, we proposed a unique vacuum ultraviolet-ozone (VUV/O3) surface-activation method for the first time to modify the Mg alloy surface before SF coating, which significantly enhanced both in vitro and in vivo performance, such as superior biocompatibility and remarkably improved corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys (∼1/18 the in vivo degradation rate of uncoated MgZnCa).",Anti-arrhythmic therapy in athletes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028906,Pharmacological research,2019 05 20,"The spectrum of arrhythmias that may be encountered in athletes ranges from isolated ectopic beats to ventricular tachycardia, usually in the context of a structurally normal heart.

To date there is no ideal effective treatment. 3, 14, 19-triacetyl andrographolide (CX-10) is a new molecule entity derived from andrographolide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotection of CX-10 against experimental cerebral ischemia. The anti-inflammation of CX-10 was screened using LPS-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Rats were subjected to 1.5 h of middle cerebral occlusion (MCAO) and then reperfusion for 72 h. The infarct size was evaluated by TTC staining, and the behavioral disturbance was evaluated, and inflammatory cytokines and anti-oxidant enzymes in brain tissues were examined. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of proteins. The results showed that CX-10 exerted potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation activities, which significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and NO release, lowered TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the brain, meanwhile increased activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-P × . The effect of CX-10 was equivalent to that of dexamethasone, and was obviously superior to that of andrographolide. CX-10 exhibited a neuroprotective effects, manifested as reducing infarct size, improving neurological function and reducing motor impairments. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that treatment with CX-10 down-regulated the expression of TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α and iNOS, induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. Overall, CX-10 has a favorable neuroprotection in ischemic brain injury. The mechanism may involve inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulation of Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. All these indicated that CX-10 is likely to be a promising agent for ischemic stroke.",12(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid downregulates monocyte-derived macrophage efferocytosis: New insights in atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028904,Pharmacological research,2019 05 20,"The involvement of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE), a 12-lipooxygenase product of arachidonic acid, has been suggested in atherosclerosis. However, its effect on macrophage functions is not completely understood, so far. The uptake of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) by macrophages is an anti-inflammatory process, impaired in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. This process induces the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), and it is regulated by Rho-GTPases, whose activation involves the isoprenylation, a modification inhibited by statins. We assessed 12-HETE levels in serum of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, and explored 12(S)-HETE in vitro effect on monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) efferocytosis. Sixty-four CAD patients and 24 healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled. Serum 12-HETE levels were measured using a tandem mass spectrometry method. MDMs, obtained from a spontaneous differentiation of adherent monocytes, were treated with 12(S)-HETE (10-50 ng/mL). Efferocytosis and RhoA activation were evaluated by flow cytometry. IL-10 was measured by ELISA. CAD patients showed increased 12-HETE serum levels compared to HS (665.2 [438.1-896.2] ng/mL and 525.1 [380.1-750.1] ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.05) and reduced levels of IL-10. MDMs expressed the 12(S)-HETE cognate receptor GPR31. CAD-derived MDMs displayed defective efferocytosis vs HS-MDMs (9.4 [7.7-11.3]% and 11.1 [9.6-14.1]% of MDMs that have engulfed apoptotic cells, respectively, p < 0.01). This reduction is marked in MDMs obtained from patients not treated with statin (9.3 [7.4-10.6]% statin-free CAD vs HS, p = 0.01; and 9.9 [8.6-11.6]% statin-treated CAD vs HS, p = 0.07). The in vitro treatment of MDMs with 12(S)-HETE (20 ng/mL) induced 20% decrease of efferocytosis (p < 0.01) and 71% increase of RhoA activated form (p < 0.05). Atorvastatin (0.1 μM) counteracted these 12(S)-HETE-mediated effects.These results show a 12(S)-HETE pro-inflammatory effect and suggest a new potential contribution of this mediator in the development of atherosclerosis.",Elafibranor restricts lipogenic and inflammatory responses in a human skin stem cell-derived model of NASH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028903,Pharmacological research,2019 05 20,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by hepatocellular steatosis with concomitant hepatic inflammation. Despite its pandemic proportions, no anti-NASH drugs have been approved yet. This is partially because drug development is decelerated due to the lack of adequate tools to assess the efficacy of potential new drug candidates. The present study describes the development and application of a new preclinical model for NASH using hepatic cells generated from human skin-derived precursors. Exposure of these cells to lipogenic (insulin, glucose, fatty acids) and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β) resulted in a characteristic NASH response, as indicated by intracellular lipid accumulation, modulation of NASH-specific gene expression, increased caspase-3/7 activity and the expression and/or secretion of inflammatory markers, including CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL8, IL1a, IL6 and IL11. The human relevance of the proposed NASH model was verified by transcriptomics analyses that revealed commonly modulated genes and the identification of the same gene classes between the in vitro system and patients suffering from NASH. The application potential of this in vitro model was demonstrated by testing elafibranor, a promising anti-NASH compound currently under clinical phase III trial evaluation. Elafibranor attenuated in vitro key features of NASH, and dramatically lowered lipid load as well as the expression and secretion of inflammatory chemokines, which in vivo are responsible for the recruitment of immune cells. This reduction in inflammatory response was NFκB-mediated. In summary, this human-relevant, in vitro system proved to be a sensitive testing tool for the investigation of novel anti-NASH compounds."

Importantly, the prokaryotic MgtE Mg2+ channel is related to mammalian SLC41A1 transporters and, therefore, biochemical and biophysical characterization of MgtE and its orthologs assumes significance. To date, the purification and structure determination of MgtE from Thermus thermophilus has been carried out using the widely used nonionic detergent, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM). However, DDM is an expensive detergent and alternative methods to produce high-quality proteins in stable and functional form will be practically advantageous to carry out structural studies in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we have utilized 'dual-detergent strategy' to successfully purify MgtE channel in a stable and functional form by employing relatively inexpensive detergents (Triton X-100 and Anzergent 3-14) for membrane solubilization and subsequently changed to DDM during purification. Our results show that Triton X-100 and Anzergent 3-14 extract MgtE well and the quality of purified protein is comparable to DDM-extracted MgtE. Interestingly, addition of high concentration of salt and glycerol during solubilization does not significantly affect the quantity and quality of MgtE. Importantly, limited proteolysis assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy and ensemble tryptophan fluorescence strongly support the use of Triton X-100, in particular, as an inexpensive, alternative detergent for the purification of MgtE without compromising the structural integrity of the channel and Mg2+-induced gating-related conformational dynamics. Overall, these results are relevant for the cost-effective purification of stable and functional membrane proteins in general, and magnesium channels, in particular.",Risk factors for falls in patients with total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028883,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2019 05 12,"Falls are common after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Here, we characterized a novel HIV-1 circulating recombinant form (CRF) consisting of CRF01_AE and subtype B (CRF101_01B) from three epidemiologically unlinked individuals. Phylogenetic analysis based on near full length genome (NFLG) sequences revealed that CRF101_01B formed a distinct monophyletic cluster supported by a high bootstrap value of 100%, distantly related to all known HIV-1 CRFs. CRF101_01B had a CRF01_AE backbone with two B segments inserted, respectively, in the gag and pol region. Further, subregion tree analysis showed that CRF01_AE backbone and subtype B segment inserted originated from a Thailand lineage. In addition, our study found that CRF101_01B originated around the year 1996-1998.

However, the effects of PPI therapy on the gastrointestinal microbiota in GERD patients remain unclear. We examined the association between the PPI usage and the microbiota present in gastric mucosal and fecal samples from GERD patients and healthy controls (HCs) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. GERD patients taking PPIs were further divided into short-term and long-term PPI user groups. We showed that PPI administration lowered the relative bacterial diversity of the gastric microbiota in GERD patients. Compared to the non-PPI-user and HC groups, higher abundances of Planococcaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and Sphingomonadaceae were found in the gastric microbiota from the PPI-user group. In addition, the Methylophilus genus was more highly abundant in the long-term PPI user group than in the short-term PPI-user group. Despite the absence of differences in alpha diversity, there were significant differences in the fecal bacterial composition of between GERD patients taking PPIs and those not taking PPIs. There was a higher abundance of Streptococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Micrococcaceae, and Flavobacteriaceae present in the fecal microbiota from the PPI-user group than those from the non-PPI-user and HC groups. Additionally, a significantly higher abundance of Ruminococcus was found in GERD patients on long-term PPI medication than that on short-term PPI medication.

This conceptual framework includes three distinct stages: (1) maternal and environmental risk factors for the development of placental malaria; (2) placental pathology and inflammation associated with placental malaria infection; and (3) postnatal impacts of placental malaria. The direct, indirect, and bidirectional effects of these risk factors on infant neurodevelopment across the three stages were critically examined. These factors ultimately culminate in an infant phenotype that not only leads to adverse birth outcomes, but also to increased risks of neurological, cognitive, and behavioural deficits that may impact the quality of life in this high-risk population. Multiple risk factors were identified in this conceptual framework; nonetheless, based on current evidence, a key knowledge gap is the uncertainty regarding which are the most important and how exactly they interact.",Efficacy and accuracy of qSOFA and SOFA scores as prognostic tools for community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028877,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 06 09,"The Japanese Respiratory Society recently updated its prognostic guidelines for pneumonia, recommending that pneumonia severity be evaluated using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA) scoring systems in a therapeutic strategy flowchart.

Whole-exome sequencing analyses demonstrated genetic heterogeneity as variants in two different genes segregated with the phenotype in two branches of the family. Members in one branch were homozygous for a pathogenic variant of TMC1. The other two affected individuals were homozygous for a missense pathogenic variant in KCNQ4 c.872C>T; p.(Pro291Leu). These two individuals had prelingual, progressive moderate to severe hearing loss, while a heterozygous carrier had late onset mild hearing loss.

However, in Brucella spp. this has not yet been studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether experimental infection by Brucella ovis alters the cholinergic activity in pro- or anti-inflammatory responses to the disease. For the study 48 mice were used, 24 infected by B. ovis and 24 non-infected. We collected samples of whole blood on days 7, 15, 30 and 60 post-infection (PI) by B. ovis. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the blood increased on days 15 and 60 PI (P < 0.05). Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in serum increased on days 7 and 60 PI (P < 0.05). An increase in serum free radical levels occurred on days 7, 15 and 60 PI (P < 0.05), and consequently superoxide dismutase activity increased on day 15 PI (P < 0.05). A reduction in catalase activity occurred when the infection became chronic (60 PI). The increase in AChE and BChE characterized a pro-inflammatory response, since these enzymes regulate levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and butyrylcholine (BuSCh), molecules with anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, with the increase of cholinesterase activity, there was an extracellular reduction of ACh, an inhibitor of several inflammatory mediators. This proinflammatory response of B. ovis infection leads to oxidative stress, and consequently to cellular damage.","Antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-adhesive activities of biosurfactants isolated from Bacillus strains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028863,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 06 16,"Biosurfactants are surface-active compounds that display a range of physiological functions. The present study investigated the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-adhesive or anti-biofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from Bacillus subtilis VSG4 and Bacillus licheniformis VS16. The antioxidant activity of the biosurfactants was studied in vitro using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals. At 5 mg/mL of the biosurfactant concentration, the scavenging of DPPH and hydroxyl radicals was found to be between 69.1-73.5% and 63.3-69.8%, respectively. The biosurfactants also displayed significant antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The anti-adhesive activities of the biosurfactants were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29523, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 19430, and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. The biosurfactants exhibited anti-adhesive activity, even at concentrations of 3-5 mg/mL. Moreover, both biosurfactants displayed notable anti-biofilm activities with a biofilm eradication percentage ranging from 63.9 to 80.03% for VSG4 biosurfactant, and from 61.1-68.4% for VS16 biosurfactant. Furthermore, VSG4 biosurfactant exhibited emulsification and surface tension stability over a wide range of pH (4-10) and temperature up to 100 °C. These results show that VSG4 and VS16 biosurfactants can be potentially used as natural antioxidants, antimicrobials, and/or anti-adhesive agents for food and biomedical applications.",Molecular detection of Hsp90 inhibitor suppressing PCV2 replication in host cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028862,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 06 16,"Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) is a pathogen that has the ability to cause devastating disease manifestations in pig populations with major economic implications. Our previous research found that Hsp90 is required for PCV2 production in PK-15 and 3D4/31 cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Hsp90 inhibitor regulating PCV2 replication and to explore its underlying mechanism. In PK-15 and 3D4/31 cells treated with 17-AAG after viral adsorption, replication of PCV2 was attenuated as assessed by quantitating the expression of viral protein. Following NF-κB activation it was observed that 24hpi with PCV2 was significantly inhibited in the presence of 17-AAG. The expression of Hsp90 associated client proteins in PCV2-infected cells were also reduced in the presence of 17-AAG. However, treatment with MG-132 failed to rescue 17-AAG mediated reduction of PCV2 production in host cells. Thus, Hsp90 regulates PCV2 by modulating cellular signaling proteins. These results highlight the importance of cellular proteins during PCV2 infection and the possibility of targeting cellular chaperones for developing new anti-rotaviral strategies.",The synthetic flavagline FL3 spares normal human skin cells from its cytotoxic effect via an activation of Bad.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028861,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 06 16,"The molecular pathways by which flavagline derivatives exert their cytotoxicity against various cancer cell types are well documented, while the mechanisms that prevent their cytotoxic effects on normal cells still have to be clarified. Here we provide the underlying molecular events by which normal skin cells remain unaffected after exposure to the synthetic flavagline FL3. Indeed, the anticancer agent fails to trigger apoptosis of healthy cells and is unable to induce the depolarization of their mitochondrial membrane and the cytosolic release of cytochrome C, in contrast to what is observed for cancer cells. Most importantly, FL3 specifically induces in normal cells, but not in malignant cells, an activation of Bad, without significant mitochondrial and cytosolic redistribution of Bax or Bcl-2. Moreover, gene knockdown of Bad sensitizes the normal fibroblastic cells to FL3 and induces a caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Bad activation, known to promote survival and block apoptosis, explains therefore the lack of cytotoxicity of FL3 on normal skin cells. Finally, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of resistance of healthy cells against FL3 cytotoxicity and identify it as a promising anticancer drug.",Prediction of the skin sensitising potential and potency of compounds via mechanism-based binary and ternary classification models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028860,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 06 08,"Skin sensitisation, one of the most frequent forms of human immune toxicity, is authenticated to be a significant endpoint in the field of drug discovery and cosmetics. Due to the drawbacks of traditional animal testing methods, in silico methods have advanced to study skin sensitisation. In this study, mechanism-based binary and ternary classification models were constructed with a comprehensive data set. 1007 compounds were collected to develop five series of local and global models based on mechanisms. In each series, compounds were classified into five groups according to EC3 values, and applied as training sets, test sets and external validation sets. For each of the five series, 81 binary classification models and 81 ternary classification models were acquired via 9 molecular fingerprints and 9 machine learning methods using a novel KNIME workflow. Meanwhile, the applicability domains for the best 10 models were figured out to certify the rationality of prediction effect. In addition, 8 toxic substructures probably causing skin sensitisation were identified to speculate whether a compound is a skin sensitiser. The mechanism-based prediction models and the toxic substructures can be applied to predict the skin sensitising potential and potency of compounds.",Investigation of iron oxide nanoparticle cytotoxicity in relation to kidney cells: A mathematical modeling of data mining.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028859,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 06 08,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) have several applications in medical fields including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), drug delivery, cancer treatment and cell splitting. Therefore, it is important to investigate their cellular toxicity. It is difficult to predict their cellular toxicity due to complexities associated with their cellular mechanisms.

For this purpose, particle size, concentration, incubation time and the surface charge of NPs were selected as the model inputs and the percentage of cell viability (%CV) as the model output. Using a version of the modeling called SA-LOOCV-GRBF, these issues can be resolved with favorable results. Since the behavior of positive zeta potential (PZP) is different from negative zeta potential (NZP), they were compared by separate modeling efforts. Kidney is a vital body organ that dispose of IONs in the body, but it is possible that these cells engage in unwanted interactions with IONs.

However, the molecular mechanism of ropivacaine in causing the neurotoxicity remains unclear. Cell viability and cell apoptosis were assessed. The functions of mitochondria and mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis were also detected. The molecular mechanism of ropivacaine-caused neurotoxicity was also evaluated. We demonstrated that ropivacaine dose-dependently suppressed the viability of neurogliocytes, and promoted neurogliocytes apoptosis. Moreover, ropivacaine significantly increased the expression of Fas by promoting the phosphorylation of p38. Ropivacaine-induced upregulation of Fas activated mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis, including the decrease of the mitochondria membrane potential, opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, releasing cytochrome c, and translocating Bcl-2 family members. Knockdown of Fas significantly suppressed the ropivacaine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of p38 or p38 inhibitor remarkably decreased the expression of Fas and attenuated ropivacaine-induced cell apoptosis, indicating that activation of the MAPK/p38/Fas signal contributed to the ropivacaine-caused neurotoxicity. Our study supplies the evidence supporting the molecular mechanism by which ropivacaine activates the MAPK/p38/Fas signal to promote neurogliocyte apoptosis and suggests that the combination of p38 inhibitor with ropivacaine might be an effective strategy to decrease the ropivacaine-caused neurogliotoxicity.",Multiple charged amino acids of Plasmodium falciparum SURFIN4.1 N-terminal region are important for efficient export to the red blood cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028841,Parasitology international,2019 05 15,"Plasmodium falciparum, an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite which causes the severe form of human malaria, exports numerous proteins to the infected red blood cell that are important for its survival and of severe pathological effect to its host. These proteins and their export mechanisms are candidates for drug and vaccine development, and among them is the Plasmodium SURFIN family of proteins. Previously we showed that the N-terminal region along with the sequence surrounding the transmembrane domain of SURFIN4.1 is essential for its export to Maurer's clefts in the red blood cell cytoplasm. We proposed that this region is recognized by a machinery responsible for protein translocation across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane surrounding the parasite. To understand the export mechanism further, we utilized a fluorescent protein-tagged mini-SURFIN4.1 consisting of the minimum essential components for export. Alanine scanning of all charged amino acids within the N-terminal region revealed that replacement of 3 glutamic acid and 2 lysine residues significantly impairs the export efficiency of this protein across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. In addition, N-terminally Myc-tagged mini-SURFIN4.1 and mini-SURFIN4.2 with similar architectures were detected with anti-Myc antibody at Maurer's clefts, indicating that elements required for export to Maurer's clefts are conserved between SURFIN4.1 and SURFIN4.2, and that N-terminal sequences of these SURFIN members are not cleaved during export. Our results implicate a conserved nature of SURFIN export to the red blood cell, particularly an important role of multiple glutamic acid and lysine residues in the SURFIN N-terminal region.","Repeated exposure to the threat of perturbation induces emotional, cognitive, and postural adaptations in young and older adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028840,Experimental gerontology,2019 05 28,"Threat-related changes in postural control and their associations with changes in emotional and cognitive states are influenced by postural threat experience, however, limited work has explored individuals' capacity to adapt threat-related responses over longer periods of threat exposure. This study examined the effects of initial and repeated postural threat exposure on emotional, cognitive, and postural responses. Twenty-seven young and twenty-seven older adults stood on a force plate fixed to a translating platform. Threat was manipulated through expectation of a temporally and directionally (left or right) unpredictable platform perturbation. Participants completed one 60s stance trial with no expectation of perturbation (No Threat) followed by 24 trials with threat of perturbation (Threat). The stance period before each perturbation varied (5-60s) except on an early Threat trial and the last Threat trial (60s), which were used for analysis. Postural threat elicited similar emotional, cognitive, and postural changes in young and older adults. With initial threat exposure, participants reported increases in self-reported anxiety and physiological arousal, as well as broad changes in attention focus. Participants also significantly increased centre of pressure (COP) amplitude and frequency, and COP power within medium and high frequencies. With repeated threat exposure, anxiety, arousal, and some threat-induced changes in attention focus significantly adapted. These changes were accompanied by significant reductions in COP frequency and COP power within medium frequencies. Some emotional and cognitive outcomes returned to no threat levels while postural outcomes did not. This study suggests that some threat-related changes in standing postural control may be closely linked with one's emotional response to threat, while others may be context-dependent.",Phase angle and metabolic equivalents as predictors of frailty transitions in advanced age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028839,Experimental gerontology,2019 05 28,"The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether two cellular and metabolic health indices, phase angle (PhA) and metabolic equivalents (METs), can predict changes in frailty states in fit community-dwelling older people.",Bioengineered scaffolds for 3D culture demonstrate extracellular matrix-mediated mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028838,Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology,2019 06 10,"Originating in the brain, glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal and virtually incurable cancer, in large part because it readily develops resistance to treatments. While numerous studies have investigated mechanisms enabling GBM cells to evade chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, few have addressed how their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) acts to promote their survival. Here, we employed a biomaterial-based, 3D culture platform to investigate systematically how interactions between patient-derived GBM cells and the brain ECM promote resistance to alkylating chemotherapies - including temozolomide, which is used routinely in clinical practice. Scaffolds for 3D culture were fabricated from hyaluronic acid (HA) - a major structural and bioactive component of the brain ECM - and functionalized with the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) tripeptide to provide sites for integrin engagement. Data demonstrate that cooperative engagement of CD44, through HA, and integrin αV, through RGD, facilitates resistance to alkylating chemotherapies through co-activation of Src, which inhibited downstream expression of BCL-2 family pro-apoptotic factors. In sum, a bioengineered, 3D culture platform was used to gain new mechanistic insights into how ECM in the brain tumor microenvironment promotes resistance to chemotherapy and suggests potential avenues for the development of novel, matrix-targeted combination therapies designed to suppress chemotherapy resistance in GBM.",A review of bispecific antibodies and antibody constructs in oncology and clinical challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028837,Pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 06 04,"Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) are antibodies that bind two distinct epitopes to can target cancer.

The concept of an ADC platform is to increase the therapeutic index (TI) of chemotherapeutics through more selective delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor cells while limiting exposure to healthy normal cells. Despite the use of antibodies targeting antigens abundantly and/or exclusively expressed on cancer cells (i.e., target cells), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in normal cells/tissues are frequently reported even at suboptimal therapeutic doses. Although advancement of ADC technology has helped to optimize all three key components (i.e., mAb, linker, and payload), DLTs remain a key challenge for ADC development. Mechanisms of ADC toxicity in normal cells/tissues are not clearly understood, but the majority of DLTs are considered to be target-independent. In addition to linker-drug instability contributing to the premature release of cytotoxic drug (payload) in circulation, uptake/trafficking of intact ADCs by both receptor-dependent (FcγRs, FcRn and C-type lectin receptors), and-independent (non-specific endocytosis) mechanisms may contribute to off-target toxicity in normal cells. In this article, we review potential mechanisms of target-independent ADC uptake and toxicity in normal cells, as well as discuss components of ADCs which may influence these mechanisms. This information will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ADC off-target toxicity and prove helpful toward improving the overall TI of the next generation of ADCs.",Histamine H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists: Where do they go?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028835,Pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 05 06,"Since the discovery of the histamine H3 receptor in 1983, tremendous advances in the pharmacological aspects of H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have been accomplished in preclinical studies.

In this review, the potential role of H3 receptors in the pathophysiology of various central nervous system, metabolic and allergic diseases is discussed. Thereafter, the current status for H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists in ongoing clinical trial studies is reviewed and obstacles in developing these agents are emphasized."

We interestingly observed that silicon incorporated compounds exhibited better performance on both criteria by targeting broader spectrum of drug receptors including G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), ion channel modulator, kinase inhibitor, protease and enzyme inhibitor and by satisfying all of five different drug-likeness criteria reported in the literature. Design compound C19 appeared as a potential drug candidate for further pharmacological research.",Solubility and bioavailability enhancement study of lopinavir solid dispersion matrixed with a polymeric surfactant - Soluplus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028820,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 20,"As a biopharmaceutical classification system Class IV drug, lopinavir (LPV) shows relatively poor water solubility and permeation in vivo. In the study, we developed novel solid dispersions (SD) of LPV to improve its bioavailability and to describe their overall behaviors. By employing solvent evaporation for a preliminary formulation screening, the SDs of LPV-polymer-sorbitan monolaurate (SBM, as the wetting agent) at 1:4:0.4 (w/w) dramatically enhanced the LPV dissolution in a non-sink medium, and then hot-melt extrusion (HME) was applied to improve the dissolution further. A hydrophilic polymer - Kollidon VA 64 (VA64) and a polymeric surfactant Soluplus were employed as matrix respectively in the optimized formulations. The dissolution profiles of extrudates were significantly higher than those of SDs prepared with solvent-evaporation method. It was attributed to the stronger intermolecular interactions between LPV and the polymers in the HME process, which was also supported by the stability analysis after 6 months storage under 25 °C/60% RH. The differential scanning calorimetry, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and equilibrium studies showed VA64 only created hydrogen bonding (H-bond) with LPV, but Soluplus generated both H-bond and micelle thanks to its amphiphilic structure. In addition, the bioavailability of LPV in Soluplus matrixed extrudate was 1.70-fold of VA64 matrixed extrudate and 3.70-fold of LPV crystal. In situ permeability and Caco-2 cell transport studies revealed that Soluplus significantly enhanced the permeability of LPV through rat intestine and Caco-2 cell monolayers by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition. Herein, Soluplus matrixed extrudate improved the LPV bioavailability through three mechanisms: H-bond with LPV, micelle formation in water and P-gp inhibition in vivo. These unique advantages of Soluplus suggested it is a promising carrier for poorly water soluble drugs, especially the substrates of P-gp.",The Oleaceae family: A source of secoiridoids with multiple biological activities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028819,Fitoterapia,2019 06 01,"In the quest to search and discover bioactive compounds from nature, terpenoids have emerged as one of the most interesting and researched classes of compounds. Secoiridoid, a type of the terpenoid, has also been extensively studied, especially their chemical structures and pharmacological effects. Oleaceae is a family of woody dicotyledonous plants with broad economic and medicinal values. This family contains a large number of flavonoids, monoterpenoids, iridoids, secoiridoids and phenylethyl alcohols, of which the secoiridoids have various biological activities. The purpose of this review is to summarize the phytochemical and pharmacological of the secoiridoids (glycosides, aglycones, derivatives and dimers) in the Oleaceae family from 1987 to 2018.

YIM 130642. The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. Compound 1 was the first example of naturally occurring phthalazinone derivative. The antimicrobial activities of all compounds towards five pathogenic strains were evaluated by a broth microdilution assay. Compound 1 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, and Candida albicans with MIC values of 32, 32, and 64 μg/mL, respectively.","Parental perinatal exposure to bisphenol A reduces the threshold to disrupt blastocyst implantation via decreasing talin, occudin and E-cadherin levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028817,"Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2019 06 01,"The aim was to evaluate the effect of perinatal BPA exposure of one or both parents on the implantation index and expression of talin, occludin and E-cadherin in the uterine epithelial cells (UEC) of the offspring. Pregnant Wistar dams (F0) received BPA or vehicle from gestational day (GD) 6 to lactation day 21. F1 animals were mated forming four groups: Control dam-Control sire (C♀-C♂), BPA dam -Control sire (B♀-C♂), Control dam -BPA sire (C♀-B♂), BPA dam -BPA sire (B♀-B♂). F1 dams were sacrificed at GD 6. Significantly decreased number of implantation sites was observed in the B♀-B♂ group as compared to the C♀-C♂ group, which correlated with decreased talin apical/basal expression ratio, occludin apical expression, and E-cadherin apical/lateral expression ratio in the UEC. Furthermore, decreased E-cadherin expression in the blastocyst was observed. Our data suggest that reduced protein expressions in F1 BPA offspring could result from decreased progesterone serum levels.",Interaction sites of PEF proteins for recognition of their targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028815,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"The EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix motif observed mainly in intracellular calcium binding proteins. The EF-hand usually occurs as a pair, EF-lobe, which is a unit of evolution and structure. Penta EF-hand (PEF) proteins form a unique group including calpain, sorcin, grancalcin, ALG-2, and peflin. The fifth EF-hand of PEF proteins makes a pair with that of another PEF protein. The members of PEF family have diverse functions and their evolution is complex. The interaction of PEF proteins with target occurs at several sites. Here, we analyzed the ancestral sequences of each group of PEF proteins and determined the interfaces for the specific and selective interaction to the target among several PEF proteins. The shape of the groove for interaction at common site is different among PEF proteins. We found that the changes at limited sites induced the divergence of interaction sites that determines the selectivity of targets. The residues involved the changes at limited sites are important for the drug design selective to each PEF protein.",Aggregation of amylin: Spectroscopic investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028814,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"Apart from its relevance to pathology, protein misfolding disease like Type-II Diabetes Mellitus, caused by amyloids of amylin protein has attracted more attention due to structural changes occurring during the aggregation process. We report extensive spectroscopy data of amylin during fibril formation through Raman, FTIR, CD, UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. UV-vis and PL spectrum showed the sigmoidal growth of fibril with a lag time of ~2 days, which is consistent with earlier reported work using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Raman spectra revealed the formation of parallel and anti-parallel β-sheet from 0% to 20% with ageing (1st day to 21st day) at pH 6.5 ± 0.1. The results are corroborated by CD and FTIR data. These show the change in β-sheet by 23% at pH 6.5 ± 0.1, 26% at pH = 1.0 ± 0.1 and 30% at pH = 12 ± 0.1. It is also shown that the formation and conversion of other secondary structures into β-sheet is very sensitive towards the pH and ageing.

In this respect, the successful incorporation of nettle in SF nanofibers was analyzed and then confirmed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The mean fiber diameter, water uptake, breaking strain, cellular attachment, and proliferation of the given nanofibers also increased as the nettle content was added, while this trend was opposite in terms of tensile strength and modulus. The in vitro release studies correspondingly demonstrated that the nettle release had been controlled according to Fickian diffusion and it was faster in the samples including more nettle. Furthermore, both ARS staining and real-time RT-PCR results suggested that nettle had enhanced the expression of both early and late markers of osteoblast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner.",Protective effects of exopolysaccharide of a medicinal fungus on probiotic bacteria during cold storage and simulated gastrointestinal conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028812,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"The efficacy of probiotic health products depends on the capability of the constituent probiotic bacteria to survive through long period of cold storage and the gastrointestinal tract. This study was to evaluate the protective effects of a high-molecular weight (MW) exopolysaccharide (EPS) from a medicinal fungus Cs-HK1 on three different bifidobacteria. The EPS had a total dietary fiber content about 70% (w/w), which was close to its total carbohydrate content. It was resistant to artificial gastric acid (pH 2) with no more than 4% (w/w) hydrolysis in 6 h. EPS at 5 g/L significantly increased the survival rate of the probiotic bacteria during cold storage (4 °C) and in simulated gastric acid, reducing the death rate of different bacterial strains by 50% to 70%. The protective effect of EPS was weaker when the concentration was decreased to 3 g/L or when the MW of EPS was reduced by partial degradation with power ultrasound. EPS also showed significantly protective effect on the all bacterial strains in bile juice. The results have demonstrated the potential value of Cs-HK1 EPS as a novel prebiotic fiber for the formulation of synbiotic products with probiotic bacteria."

Highly porous polycaprolactone (PCL)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers were loaded with different concentrations of SSD or AgNPs and compared comprehensively in vitro and in vivo. SSD and AgNPs indicated a strong and equal antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. However, SSD had more toxicity against fibroblast cells over one week in vitro culture. An in vivo model of wound healing on male Wistar rats was developed with a full thickness wound. All the wound dressings indicated enough flexibility and hydrophilicity, which resulted an adequate adhesion into the wound closure. After 30 days, the control group without any treatment indicated 31% wound closure while the group treated with PCL/PVA (without antimicrobial components) indicated 44% wound closure. Presence of antimicrobial components in the PCL/PVA nanofibers resulted into a lower inflammation response leading to a faster proliferation and maturation phases. In agreement with the higher biocompatibility of AgNPs than SSD, a faster angiogenesis, epithelialization and subsequently, remodeling were observed for the wound dressings loaded with AgNPs. The group treated with the highest concentration of AgNPs showed the fastest healing process leading to a final epithelialization with 96% wound closure after 30 days. This study indicated that AgNPs have higher biocompatibility and regulate wound healing process more efficiently compared to SSD. PCL/PVA nanofibers conjugated with AgNPs are promising wound dressings for full-thickness wounds.","Human health risk assessment: Study of a population exposed to fluoride through groundwater of Agra city, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028799,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 06 15,"Fluoride (F-), a harmful compound if present in high concentration, is typically found in groundwater. It is important to investigate the F- concentrations in groundwaters of areas where individuals use groundwater for drinking purposes. The objectives of this study were: (a) to estimate the F- exposure, and (b) to assess the non-carcinogenic risk through consumption of groundwater among urban population (different age groups) of Agra city. A total of 28 groundwater samples were collected from Agra city in May 2016, which comprised 22 samples from hand pump and 6 samples from tube wells from shallow aquifers at different sites. The F- concentrations varied from 0.90 to 4.12 mg/L with an average value of 1.88 mg/L. The results obtained reveal that about 64% of the samples exceeded the F- permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L. Nevertheless, 32% of the samples were well within the WHO drinking water guidelines and 3.5% of the samples from the groundwater were below the 1.0 mg/L threshold. The maximum estimated exposure doses were 0.69, 0.31 and 0.12 mg/kg/day for infants, children and adults, respectively. A dental fluorosis becomes evident when the results obtained are compared with an oral reference dose of 0.06 mg/kg/day. The hazard quotient (HQ) was found to be more than 1 for infants and children in all the studied areas which indicates that young consumers are more vulnerable to non-carcinogenic risk due to exposure of F-. On the other hand, the adults at about 71% of the sampled sites may be victims of non-carcinogenic risk. From the results obtained in this study, it is recommended that there be implementation of the appropriate remediation for defluoridation of water to circumvent the population from the probable health risks of F-.",Assessing in vitro dermal absorption of dry residues of agrochemical sprays using human skin within OECD TG 428.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028797,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 06 15,"We describe a novel experimental method that mimics exposure to dried agrochemical residues on contact surfaces during re-entry into crops. It includes the creation of dry dislodgeable residues and subsequent transfer to human skin for in vitro measurement of dermal absorption within a standard Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline (OECD TG) 428 study. A pre-determined volume of spray containing 14C-labelled active substance is transferred onto a polytetrafluorethylene-coated septum and air-dried. The septum is then gently placed onto the pre-wetted skin mounted in a flow-through Franz diffusion chamber. The septum is gently rotated thrice to transfer the dose. Preliminary tests determined transfer efficiency to ensure the appropriate test concentration on the skin. Then, a standard dermal absorption study is performed according to OECD TG 428. Results from 10 compounds indicate that the methodology can be robustly incorporated into a standard TG study. These data show that the dermal absorption from a dry dislodgeable residue is lower than that from the equivalent dose of the aqueous spray, regardless of formulation type or active substance. Studies following the scenario described above can be a suitable tool to better estimate dermal absorption from dry residues in re-entry worker and resident exposure assessment for agrochemicals.","Bioaccessibility of nickel and cobalt in powders and massive forms of stainless steel, nickel- or cobalt-based alloys, and nickel and cobalt metals in artificial sweat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028796,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 06 15,"Nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) are the most common metal allergens upon skin contact at occupational settings and during consumer handling of metals and alloys. A standardized test (EN, 1811) exists to assess Ni release from articles of metals and alloys in massive forms intended for direct and prolonged skin contact, but no corresponding test exists for other materials such as powders or massive forms of alloys placed on the market or to determine the release of Co, for which only limited data is available. Differences in Ni and Co release from massive forms of a range of common stainless steels and some high-alloyed grades compared to Ni and Co metals were therefore assessed in artificial sweat for 1 week at 30 °C according to EN 1811. A comparable modified test procedure was elaborated and used for powders and some selected massive alloys. All alloys investigated released significantly less amount of Ni (100-5000-fold) and Co (200-400,000-fold) compared with Ni and Co metal, respectively. Almost all alloys showed a lower bioaccessible concentration (0.007-6.8 wt% Ni and 0.00003-0.6 wt% Co) when compared to corresponding bulk alloy contents (0.1-53 wt% Ni, 0.02-65 wt% Co). Observed differences are, among other factors, related to differences in bulk composition and to surface oxide characteristics. For the powders, less Ni and Co were released per surface area, but more per mass, compared to the corresponding massive forms.",The impact of changeability of enriched environment on exploration in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028795,Behavioural processes,2019 06 10,"Although the positive effect of environmental enrichment on animals' cognitive capacities is well-known, it remains unclear what role changeability plays in this context. Our study aims to analyse the impact of environmental changeability on the level of exploration and the rate of habituation to novelty. Prior to the experiment, the animals were housed in three settings: enriched stable conditions, enriched changing conditions and standard conditions. Environmental changeability was introduced by re-arranging objects in the housing pen. A test was conducted to measure the level of exploration in adult individuals. The study results suggest that rats housed in standard conditions exhibit a higher demand for interactions with the new environment. However, once novelty is introduced, rats from the enriched environments spend more time than their standard counterparts exploring the new objects. No significant differences have been observed in the behaviour of rats from the stable and changeable conditions. It may be concluded, therefore, that in a setting characterised by long-lasting environmental enrichment, the changeability of the environment plays no major role, at least with respect to exploration, general activity and the rate of habituation to novelty. It may be linked to the relatively quick extinguishment of behaviours reinforced by intrinsic reinforcement.","Association among ACE, ESR1 polymorphisms and preeclampsia in Brazilian pregnant women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028794,Molecular and cellular probes,2019 05 31,"Genetic, immune and environmental factors are involved in preeclampsia (PE) etiopathogenesis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if polymorphisms in ACE and ESR1 genes were associated with PE occurrence.",Transcription regulation of NRF1 on StAR reduces testosterone synthesis in hypoxemic murine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028793,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 06 07,"Male chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnea patients are associated with serum testosterone level decline because of hypoxemia, resulting in male sexual dysfunction and lower reproductive capacity. Although testosterone replacement therapy used in clinic achieves good results, the side effects indicates that understanding the mechanism followed with targeted treatments are more meaningful. The known mechanism of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) mediated steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) repression did not well explain the reason of hypoxia induced testosterone decline. Our primary results indicated Nuclear respiratory factor 1(NRF1) might be participate in StAR transcription regulation. The study aims to identify the mechanism of the regulation of StAR by NRF1, providing an explanation for the decrease of testosterone induced by hypoxemia. Testosterone level and StAR were determined in COPD model rats, sleep apnea model mice and hypoxia rats (10%O2). Results indicated NRF1, StAR and testosterone decreased in testis and ovary and increased in adrenal. Regulation of NRF1 expression under normoxia or hypoxia induced synchronous changes of both StAR and testosterone, indicating the decrease of NRF1 induced StAR repression in hypoxemia were the main cause of serum testosterone decline. The results were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assays, regulation of NRF1 synchronously altered the transcriptional activity of StAR. By ChIP, EMSA supershift, NRF1 was found to bind to the Star promoter region. Mutation assays identified two NRF1-binding sites on mouse Star promoter. These findings indicated that NRF1 positivly regulated Star transcription through directly binding to the Star promoter at -1445/-1422 and -44/-19.",RNA-seq analysis of LPS-induced transcriptional changes and its possible implications for the adrenal gland dysregulation during sepsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028792,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 06 07,"Activation of the adrenal gland stress response is of utmost importance to survive sepsis. Experimental and clinical evidence exists demonstrating that adrenal gland often develops functional and structural damage due to sepsis with mechanisms remaining largely unknown. In the present study, we have used RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology to analyze changes in adrenal transcriptome elucidated by bacterial LPS. We aimed to find particularly alterations in genes that were previously not reported to be involved in the adrenal gland dysregulation in contexts of sepsis. Our results demonstrate that systemic administration of LPS significantly altered expression of 8458 genes as compared to saline injected animals. The subsequent quality and functional analysis of these gene signatures revealed that LPS-induced highly homogenous transcriptional response in total upregulating 4312 and downregulating 4146 genes. Furthermore, functional annotation analysis together with gene enrichment set analysis (GSEA) clearly demonstrated that adrenal response to LPS involved alterations in multiple pathways related to the inflammatory response along with previously unexplored activation of the hypoxia pathway. In addition, LPS strongly downregulated genes involved in the adrenal homeostasis, development, and regeneration. Those alterations were subsequently verified in clinically relevant cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model. Collectively, our study demonstrates that RNA-seq is a very useful method that can be applied to search for new unexplored pathways potentially involved in adrenal gland dysregulation during sepsis.",Accelerated positive contrast MRI of interventional devices using parallel compressed sensing imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028791,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 02,"Susceptibility-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method can image small MR-compatible devices with positive contrast.

This study presents a parallel compressive sensing technique with a modified fast spin echo to accelerate data acquisition for the susceptibility-based positive contrast MRI. The method integrates the generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions and the compressive sensing techniques in the reconstruction algorithm. MR imaging data acquired from several phantoms containing interventional devices such as biopsy needles, stent, and brachytherapy seeds, used for validating the proposed technique. The results show that it can speed up data acquisition by a factor of about five while preserving the quality of the positive contrast images.",High temperature limits on developmental canalization in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028790,Mechanisms of development,2019 05 22,"The normal embryogenesis of marine animals is typically confined to a species-specific range of temperatures. Within that temperature range development results in a consistent, or canalized, phenotype, whereas above and below the range abnormal phenotypes are produced. This study reveals a high temperature threshold, occurring over a 1-2 °C range, for normal embryonic development in C. intestinalis. Above that threshold the prevalence of morphological abnormalities increases significantly, beginning with cleavage and gastrula stages, and becoming more pronounced as embryogenesis proceeds. However, even in highly morphologically abnormal temperature disrupted (TD) embryos, muscle, endoderm, notochord, epidermis, and sensory pigment cells are recognizable, as evidenced by histochemical markers or morphology. On the other hand, morphogenesis of the notochord and other structures is dependent on precise cell movement and shape changes after the gastrula stage, which are disrupted above the high temperature threshold. These findings suggest that morphogenetic processes may be more sensitive to high temperature than cell type specification events. They also point to avenues for investigation of the limiting factors to developmental canalization in marine invertebrates."

It is now clear that cAMP is not uniformly distributed within cardiac myocytes but confined in specific subcellular compartments where it modulates key players of the excitation-contraction coupling as well as other processes including gene transcription, mitochondrial homeostasis and cell death. This review will cover the major cAMP microdomains in cardiac myocytes.

Drugs acting at these transporters can act as inhibitors or as releasers. In addition, it has been recently appreciated that some compounds are less efficacious releasers than amphetamine. Thus, they are classified as partial releasers. Compounds can act on both SERT and DAT or display exquisite selectivity for either SERT or DAT, but the structural basis for selectivity is poorly understood. The trifluoromethyl-substitution of methcathinone in the para-position has been shown to dramatically shift the selectivity of methcathinone (MCAT) towards SERT. Here, we examined MCAT, para-trifluoromethyl-methcathinone (pCF3MCAT) and other analogues to understand (i) the determinants of selectivity and (ii) the effects of the para-CF3-substitution of MCAT on the transport cycle. We systematically tested different para-substituted MCATs by biochemical, computational and electrophysiological approaches: addition of the pCF3group, but not of other substituents with larger van der Waal's volume, lipophilicity or polarity, converted the DAT-selective MCAT into a SERT-selective partial releaser. Electrophysiological and superfusion experiments, together with kinetic modelling, showed that pCF3MCAT, but not MCAT, trapped a fraction of SERTs in an inactive state by occupying the S2-site. These findings define a new mechanism of action for partial releasers, which is distinct from the other two known binding modes underlying partial release. Our observations highlight the fact that the substrate permeation pathway of monoamine transporters supports multiple binding modes, which can be exploited for drug design.",Serotonergic modulation of feeding behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans and other related nematodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028772,Neuroscience research,2019 05 18,"Serotonin is a conserved neuromodulator that controls feeding behavior in response to environmental inputs in a wide range of species, including the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. To understand the detailed mechanism and evolution of serotonergic neuromodulation, the feeding behaviors of C. elegans and related species have been studied intensively because of their simple neural anatomy and genetic manipulability. C. elegans shows patterned movements of a feeding structure called the pharynx, and serotonin modulates feeding rhythms via several serotonin receptors expressed in pharyngeal motor neurons and muscles. Environmental inputs and physiological states like food signals, starvation, and heat affect the activity of serotonergic neurons and downstream neural pathways. We focus on serotonergic neural pathways in the feeding behavior of C. elegans and other nematodes, neuromodulation between environmental inputs and behavioral outputs, and their evolutionary path.",DNA methylation and chromatin modifiers in colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028771,Molecular aspects of medicine,2019 05 03,"Colorectal carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic alterations over time that ultimately leads to disease progression and metastasis. Binding of transcription factors to gene promoter regions alone cannot explain the complex regulation pattern of gene expression during this process. It is the chromatin structure that allows for a high grade of regulatory flexibility for gene expression. Posttranslational modifications on histone proteins such as acetylation, methylation, or phosphorylation determine the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA. DNA methylation, a chemical modification of DNA that modulates chromatin structure and gene transcription acts in concert with these chromatin conformation alterations. Another epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression is represented by small non-coding RNAs.

Compared to mammals and birds, there are very few behavioral studies using operant conditioning paradigm in teleosts. Here we aim to establish matching-to-sample task (MTS) in adult zebrafish, using visual cues (colors) as discriminative stimuli. Unlike simple one-to-one color-reward association learning, MTS requires ability for context integration. In this study, zebrafish learned to perform the simultaneous-matching-to-sample (SMTS) within 15 sessions. After the SMTS training, working memory was tested by inserting a delay period (delayed matching-to-sample; DMTS). Zebrafish could perform the DMTS with a delay of at least 3-4 seconds. They could also learn to perform the DMTS even with a delay period from the beginning of the training session. These results strongly suggest that adult zebrafish possess working memory. However, our study also indicates limitations of zebrafish in cognitive flexibility or attention: they could perform SMTS/DMTS only in a certain set-up. The presence of working memory without the mesencephalic dopamine neurons indicates the convergent evolution of this function in amniotes and teleosts.",Voluntary exercise enables stress resistance in females.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028765,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 12,"Stress-related disorders are more common in females than males. This difference could arise from differential responses to behavioral interventions that enable stress resistance between sexes. In male rats, regular physical activity prevents the behavioral consequences of uncontrollable stress, such as social avoidance and exaggerated fear conditioning. However, it is unknown if these protective effects are also present in females. Here we demonstrate for the first time in female rats that six weeks of voluntary wheel running buffers against the behavioral sequelae of uncontrollable stress. This observation allows for mechanistic investigations of exercise-induced stress resistance in both sexes.",Cardiac electrical and contractile disorders promoted by anabolic steroid overdose are associated with late autonomic imbalance and impaired Ca2+ handling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028764,Steroids,2019 05 28,Investigate cardiac electrical and mechanical dysfunctions elicited by chronic anabolic steroid (AS) overdose.

In this study, APCs generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were first treated with mitomycin-C, followed by stimulation with Sal-HA, Sal-M2e, Sal-NA or Salmonella alone for 24 h. Subsequently, stimulated APCs were coincubated with untreated PBMCs (1:10) of the same individual for 24 or 72 h and then analysed for cytokine induction and T cell proliferations by qRT-PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Our results demonstrated that APCs stimulated with Sal-HA, Sal-M2e or Sal-NA induced significantly (p < .05) higher CD3+CD4+ T cell proliferations compared to the APCs treated with Salmonella alone. Our data further revealved that APCs treated with Sal-HA induced significantly (p < .05) higher CD3+CD4+ T cell responses compared to the APCs treated with either Sal-M2e or Sal-NA, which both induced almost comparable levels. The T cell proliferation responses were further measured by lymphocyte proliferation assay and the results showed that Sal-HA and Sal-M2e stimulated APCs induced significantly (p < .05) higher proliferations in T cells compared to the APCs stimulated with either Sal-NA or Salmonella alone. With respect to cytokine inductions, APCs treated with either Sal-HA or Sal-M2e induced significantly (p < .05) higher mRNA transcription levels of proinflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23), Th1 (IFN-γ), Th17 (IL-17 and IL-21) and Th2 (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines in T cells compared to Sal-NA or Salmonella alone treated APCs. In conclusion, we show that Salmonella system can efficiently deliver vaccine antigens to APCs and is, thus, capable to elicit heterologous antigen-specific adaptive immunity.",Patients' experiences with South Carolina's immediate postpartum Long-acting reversible contraception Medicaid policy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028752,Contraception,2019 04 27,We sought to examine women's experiences with immediate postpartum LARC counseling and use in the context of South Carolina's Medicaid policy.,Nicotinamide inhibits corneal endothelial mesenchymal transition and accelerates wound healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028751,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) maintain the clarity of the cornea through the barrier and pump function. Ex vivo culture or injury may cause corneal endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EnMT) and lead to loss of function. In this study, we explored the effects of nicotinamide (NIC) on the wound healing of rabbit corneal endothelium and the proliferation, migration, and EnMT of cultured human CEC lines. The animal results showed that corneal clarity was rapidly recovered within seven days through topical application of NIC in the rabbits with mechanical injury of the corneal endothelium, while the control corneas remained edematous and cloudy. Whole-mounted corneal staining found the expressions of Na+/K+-ATPase, aquaporin-1, and zonula occludens-1 were mainly localized to the boundaries of regenerated endothelium in NIC-treated eyes, in contrast to the scattered staining in vehicle-treated eyes. Interestingly, we found that NIC application inhibited the expression of typical EnMT marker alpha-smooth muscle actin, which appeared in the rabbit corneal endothelial wound healing. In vitro, NIC promoted the proliferation, but not the migration, of cultured human CECs. Moreover, NIC effectively inhibited transforming growth factor beta-1-induced corneal EnMT and decreased the levels of EnMT regulators snail and slug. Therefore, our study indicates that NIC enhances corneal endothelial wound healing through the promotion of proliferation and the inhibition of EnMT, which may provide a potential pharmaceutical agent for treating corneal endothelial dysfunction.",Long term features of diabetic retinopathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028750,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss among working-age adults. To assess whether the Wistar rat with Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes is a suitable animal model of human proliferative diabetic retinopathy we evaluated the vascular changes to assess the diabetic retinopathy (DR) stages in this model. After two weeks of intraperitoneal STZ (55 mg/kg) injection in male Wistar rats (270-300 g), they were considered diabetic with persistent blood glucose levels ≥ 16.65 mmol/L. The diabetic and control rats were investigated after 1, 3, 6 and 9 months by electroretinography, Evans blue assay, dextran fluorescence retinal angiography, and retinal histopathological studies. Retinal vascular permeability in the diabetic groups increased significantly in all diabetic groups. The amplitude of a- and b-waves decreased significantly in all diabetic groups compared with the age-matched control groups. The latent time of a-waves in the diabetic groups was delayed at 3 months of diabetes and this delay remained relatively constant till 9 months following the onset of diabetes. Although the latent time of b-wave in the diabetic groups increased slightly, a significant difference was found right at 9 months of diabetes. Vascular density and branching point numbers significantly decreased in the diabetic eyes at 3 and 6 months while they increased at 9 months, which was not significant. Intraretinal hemorrhage and ischemic changes were detected in the half of diabetic rats after 6 months and considered as preproliferative stage of diabetic retinopathy. Although preproliferative changes were detected in all diabetic rats at 9 months, half of them showed vitreous neovascularization attached to retina and retinal folds which can be considered as proliferative stage of DR. Intraretinal hemorrhage, extensive leakage of fluorescein, retinal folds, and vitreous neovascularization were the most prominent findings of severe and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in a fraction of the STZ-induced diabetic rats which were comparable to that of the human patients. STZ-induced diabetic rats can be considered to be a potentially useful model for studies on pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in human.",An optimization of tear extraction method: A simple tool for screening and diagnosis in the medicine of the future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028749,Experimental eye research,2019 04 27,"Predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM) is a current concept in healthcare based on the analysis of biomarkers through non-invasive methods. Especially using inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers for screening. Quantification of tear total protein content is important to identify potential, specific biomarkers, such as malondialdehyde concerning oxidative stress. The Schirmer strip test is an accessible and simple method for tear analysis. However, it is limited by the low concentration of biomarkers in the human tear. In this preliminary study, different procedures were compared for the extraction of tear proteins and malondialdehyde. Schirmer strips were used to obtain tears from healthy subjects. Ionic strength and surfactant agents were assessed, as well as different centrifugation parameters. Finally, several volumes of n-butanol on the process of malondialdehyde extraction were evaluated. Our results showed that ionic strength strongly influences the extraction process, although most studies have suggested that surfactant agents are the most relevant factor; the best results were obtained using a 2 M solution of NaCl in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Regarding centrifugation, leaving the Schirmer strip tip left hanging outside the tube cap and using 1000 rpm was the best option, which is a lower centrifugation speed than the usually reported on literature. Moreover, 250 μL was the optimal n-butanol volume for malondialdehyde extraction. The importance of this study relies on the increasing relevance of the biomarkers in the field of PPPM and the need of a standardized method to extract biomarkers from the tears, to optimize its use.",Factors associated with current tobacco use among adolescents and young students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028748,Jornal de pediatria,2019 05 07,"To determine the prevalence of current tobacco use and its association with sociodemographic factors and risk behaviors among adolescents and young students, according to gender.",Analysis of neonatal mortality risk factors in Brazil: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028747,Jornal de pediatria,2019 05 03,"To identify, using a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, which risk factors are significantly associated with neonatal mortality in Brazil, and to build a comprehensive national analysis on neonatal mortality.",STRONGkids validation: tool accuracy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028746,Jornal de pediatria,2019 05 11,Validate the accuracy of the Screening Tool for Risk on Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids) and estimate the prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk in hospitalized children.,Low FODMAPs diet for functional abdominal pain disorders in children: critical review of current knowledge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028745,Jornal de pediatria,2019 05 04,"This narrative review aimed to provide practitioners a synthesis of the current knowledge on the role of a low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols diet in reducing symptoms associated with functional abdominal pain disorders in children.

In the search of new effective therapies, identification of synthetic lethal partners of AML genetic alterations might represent a suitable approach to tailor patient treatment. Genetic mutations directly affecting DNA repair genes are not commonly present in AML. Nevertheless, several studies indicate that AML cells show high levels of DNA lesions and genomic instability. Leukaemia-driving oncogenes (e.g., RUNX1-RUNXT1, PML-RARA, TCF3-HLF, IDH1/2, TET2) or treatment with targeted agents directed against aberrant kinases (e.g., JAK1/2 and FLT3 inhibitors) have been associated with reduced DNA repair gene expression/activity that would render leukaemia blasts selectively sensitive to synthetic lethality induced by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Thus, specific oncogenic chimeric proteins or gene mutations, rare or typically distinctive of certain leukaemia subtypes, may allow tagging cancer cells for destruction by PARPi. In this review, we will discuss the rationale for using PARPi in AML subtypes characterized by a specific genetic background and summarize the preclinical and clinical evidence reported so far on their activity when used as single agents or in combination with classical cytotoxic chemotherapy or with agents targeting AML-associated mutated proteins."

In this study, we attempted to examine how the inhibition of epilepsy-related cholinergic plasticity may be reflected in seizure susceptibility and/or in the development of chronic epilepsy and its neurological consequences. For this purpose, adult Wistar rats received intrahippocampal injections of low doses of 192-IgG-saporin (SAP) to produce a moderate, but significant loss of septohippocampal cholinergic cells and to suppress their plasticity. Then, animals were treated with kainic acid to induce status epilepticus, which leads to the development of chronic epilepsy later in life. It was found that SAP-pretreatment was associated with longer latency to the onset of status epilepticus and with reduced mortality rate, suggesting that increased activity of septal cholinergic cells may potentiate seizures. Interestingly, months later, a greater percentage of rats with intact septohippocampal cholinergic connections showed spontaneous seizures, when compared to SAP-pretreated rats. Treatment with kainic acid produced death of 40-50% of hippocampal neurons and this effect was not ameliorated by prior cholinergic depletion. Moreover, the kainate induced cognitive deficits were detected in both SAP-pretreated and sham-pretreated groups. These data suggest that seizure-induced plasticity of cholinergic cells may indeed enhance seizure susceptibility and contribute to epileptogenic processes. They do not support the hypothesis that epilepsy-related hypertrophy of cholinergic neurons may potentiate hippocampal cell loss and respective behavioral impairments.",A newly identified nociresponsive region in the transitional zone (TZ) in rat sensorimotor cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028729,Brain research,2019 05 19,"The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) comprises a number of functionally distinct regions, reflecting the diversity of somatosensory receptor submodalities innervating the body. In particular, two spatially and functionally distinct nociceptive regions have been described in primate S1 (Vierck et al., 2013; Whitsel et al., 2019). One region is located mostly in Brodmann cytoarchitectonic area 1, where a subset of neurons exhibit functional characteristics associated with myelinated Aδ nociceptors and perception of 1st/sharp, discriminative pain. The second region is located at the transition between S1 and primary motor cortex (M1) in area 3a, where neurons exhibit functional characteristics associated with unmyelinated C nociceptors and perception of 2nd/slow, burning pain. To test the hypothesis that in rats the transitional zone (TZ) - which is a dysgranular region at the transition between M1 and S1 - is the functional equivalent of the nociresponsive region of area 3a in primates, extracellular spike discharge activity was recorded from TZ neurons in rats under general isoflurane anesthesia. Thermonoxious stimuli were applied by lowering the contralateral forepaw or hindpaw into a 48-51 °C heated water bath for 5-10 s. Neurons in TZ were found to be minimally affected by non-noxious somatosensory stimuli, but highly responsive to thermonoxious skin stimuli in a slow temporal summation manner closely resembling that of nociresponsive neurons in primate area 3a. Selective inactivation of TZ by topical lidocaine application suppressed or delayed the nociceptive withdrawal reflex, suggesting that TZ exerts a tonic facilitatory influence over spinal cord neurons producing this reflex. In conclusion, TZ appears to be a rat homolog of the nociresponsive part of monkey area 3a. A possibility is considered that this region might be primarily engaged in autonomic aspects of nociception.","Differential suppression of the ipsi- and contralateral nociceptive reflexes in the neonatal rat spinal cord by agonists of µ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028728,Brain research,2019 05 19,"Nociceptive discharges caused by the unilateral tissue damage are processed in the spinal cord by both ipsi- and contralateral neuronal circuits. The mechanisms of the neurotransmitter control of this bilateral excitation spread is poorly understood. Spinally administered opiates are known to suppress nociceptive transmission and nociceptive withdrawal reflexes. Here we investigated whether three major types of opioid receptors are involved in the bilateral control of the spinal nociceptive sensorimotor processing. Effects of the µ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptor agonists on the ipsi- and contralateral nociceptive reflexes were studied by recording slow ventral root potentials in an isolated spinal cord preparation of the new-born rat. Absolute levels of expression of the opioid genes were analyzed by the droplet digital PCR. Ipsi- and contralateral slow ventral root potentials were most strongly suppressed by the µ-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, by 63% and 85%, followed by the κ-opioid receptor agonist U-50488H, by 44% and 73%, and δ-opioid receptor agonist leucine-enkephalin, by 27% and 49%, respectively. All these agonists suppressed stronger contra- than ipsilateral responses. Naloxone prevented effects of the agonists indicating that they act through opioid receptors, which, as we show, are expressed in the neonatal spinal cord at the levels similar to those in adults. Thus, opioid receptor agonists suppress the segmental nociceptive reflexes. Stronger contralateral effects suggest that the endogenous opioid system regulates sensorimotor processing in the spinal commissural pathways. These effects of opioids may be relevant for treatment of symmetric clinical pain symptoms caused by unilateral tissue injury.","Engineering aldo-keto reductase 1B10 to mimic the distinct 1B15 topology and specificity towards inhibitors and substrates, including retinoids and steroids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028727,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 14,"The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily comprises NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes that catalyze the reduction of a variety of carbonyl compounds. AKRs are classified in families and subfamilies. Humans exhibit three members of the AKR1B subfamily: AKR1B1 (aldose reductase, participates in diabetes complications), AKR1B10 (overexpressed in several cancer types), and the recently described AKR1B15. AKR1B10 and AKR1B15 share 92% sequence identity, as well as the capability of being active towards retinaldehyde. However, AKR1B10 and AKR1B15 exhibit strong differences in substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity. Remarkably, their substrate-binding sites are the most divergent parts between them. Out of 27 residue substitutions, six are changes to Phe residues in AKR1B15. To investigate the participation of these structural changes, especially the Phe substitutions, in the functional features of each enzyme, we prepared two AKR1B10 mutants. The AKR1B10 m mutant carries a segment of six AKR1B15 residues (299-304, including three Phe residues) in the respective AKR1B10 region. An additional substitution (Val48Phe) was incorporated in the second mutant, AKR1B10mF48. This resulted in structures with smaller and more hydrophobic binding pockets, more similar to that of AKR1B15. In general, the AKR1B10 mutants mirrored well the specific functional features of AKR1B15, i.e., the different preferences towards the retinaldehyde isomers, the much higher activity with steroids and ketones, and the unique behavior with inhibitors. It can be concluded that the Phe residues of loop C (299-304) contouring the substrate-binding site, in addition to Phe at position 48, strongly contribute to a narrower and more hydrophobic site in AKR1B15, which would account for its functional uniqueness. In addition, we have investigated the AKR1B10 and AKR1B15 activity toward steroids. While AKR1B10 only exhibits residual activity, AKR1B15 is an efficient 17-ketosteroid reductase. Finally, the functional role of AKR1B15 in steroid and retinaldehyde metabolism is discussed.","Increased expression of DCLK1, a novel putative CSC maker, is associated with tumor aggressiveness and worse disease-specific survival in patients with bladder carcinomas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028726,Experimental and molecular pathology,2019 05 24,"Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has been characterized as a novel potential cancer stem cell (CSC) marker in several types of cancer. It is considered as one of the most specific markers for distinguishing colorectal CSCs from normal stem cells. Yet, there are limited reports on the role of DCLK1 as a putative CSC marker in bladder cancer. Using immunohistochemistry, DCLK1 expression was examined in a well-defined tissue microarray series of 472 bladder cancer tissues. The association between DCLK1 protein expression and clinicopathological features, as well as survival outcomes, was assessed. Our findings showed strong, moderate, and weak DCLK1 expression in 123 (26.1%), 230 (48.7%), and 119 (25.2%) of the bladder cancer specimens, respectively. Higher expression of DCLK1 was significantly associated with increase in histological grade (P ≤ .001), pT stage (P = .014), lamina propria (P = .006), and lamina propria/muscularis (L/M) involvement (P = .014). On multivariate analysis, pT stage (P < .001), histological grade (P = .021), and lamina propria involvement (P = .001) were independent prognostic factors in DCLK1 expression. Moreover, the expression of DCLK1 was found to be an independent marker of poor prognosis for disease- specific survival (DSS) (P = .048) in bladder carcinomas. Our observations showed that DCLK1 expression was associated with more aggressive tumor behavior, more advanced disease, and poorer DSS in patients with bladder carcinomas. However, any potential clinical applications of DCLK1 as a novel target molecule in bladder cancer patients would require further investigations.",The 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) regulates proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy via mediating VEGF.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028725,Experimental and molecular pathology,2019 04 27,"The 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) belongs to a family of the heat shock protein implicated in the cellular response to environmental stress. Previous data demonstrated that ORP150 regulates the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to drive progression of angiogenesis associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, the expression and biological functions of serum ORP150 levels in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remain unclear. In this study, we reported for the first time that ORP150 was up-regulated in serum of patients with DN. Moreover, we observed the dramatic increase in serum ORP150 accompanied with the elevated levels of proteinuria and serum VEGF levels in DN, indicating the possible involvement of ORP150 in regulation of albuminuria via mediating VEGF in DN. Employing the streptozotocin (STZ) to construct the DN model, we confirmed the positive correlation of ORP150 with VEGF in vivo. Monoclonal anti-ORP150 antibodies treatment significantly decreased the secretion of VEGF and albuminuria in STZ-induced DN models. Consequently, our data suggested that ORP150 levels were positively correlated with proteinuria burden via mediating VEGF in DN. It may be considered as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.",High prevalence of CTX-M-1 group in ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae infection in intensive care units in southern Chile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028724,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,2019 05 24,"Enterobacteria-producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) play an important role in healthcare infections, increasing hospitalization time, morbidity and mortality rates. Among several ESBLs that emerge from these pathogens, CTX-M-type enzymes had the most successful global spread in different epidemiological settings. Latin America presents high prevalence of CTX-M-2 in ESBL-producing enterobacterial infections with local emergence of the CTX-M-1 group. However, this high prevalence of the CTX-M-1 group has not yet been reported in Chile. The aim of this study was to identify ESBLs among enterobacteria isolated from clinical samples of critically ill patients from southern Chile. One-hundred thirty seven ESBL-producing bacteria were isolated from outpatients from all critical patient units from Hernán Henríquez Aravena Hospital. Phenotype characterization was performed by antibiogram, screening of ESBL, and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). PCR was used for genetic confirmation of resistance. Molecular typing was performed by ERIC-PCR. ESBL-producing isolates were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=115), Escherichia coli (n=18), Proteus mirabilis (n=3), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=1), presenting multidrug resistance profiles. PCR amplification showed that the strains were positive for blaSHV (n=111/81%), blaCTX-M-1 (n=116/84.7%), blaTEM (n=100/73%), blaCTX-M-2 (n=28/20.4%), blaCTX-M-9 (0.7%), blaPER-1 (0.7%), and blaGES-10 (0.7%).

Five goats were infected with an oral gavage of 150 metacercarial cysts of F. gigantica and anthelmintic treatment occurred at 4 weeks post infection with an oral dose of 10 mg/kg. They were euthanized at 0 (untreated), 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post treatment (h pt). Juvenile flukes were recovered from each of the goat's liver and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The untreated control flukes showed normal ultrastructure and no apparent changes were observed at 24 h pt. At 48 h pt, moderate levels of disruption were observed to the tegument and minor changes to the sub-tegument which included widespread blebbing and disruption of apical tegumental membrane, swollen mitochondria, reduced number of secretory bodies, swelling of basal infolds leading to severe vacuolation, and relatively mild disruption to the subtegumental muscle fibres, parenchyma and tegumental cells, whereas the gastrodermal cells appeared less affected. By 72 h pt, sloughing of the tegumental syncytium was evident leading to the exposure of the basal lamina and the disruption was severe in the subtegument too. At 96 h pt, the flukes were totally devoid of tegument and the disruption was extremely severe, distorting the ultrastructure of the entire fluke's body. The results of the present study revealed that the flukes showed time-dependent progressive disruption to the internal tissues which became increasingly severe over time pt. This is the first study to detail the time-scale and impacts on ultrastructural morphology of the in vivo TCBZ treatment of the immature tropical liver fluke, Fasciola gigantica."

In vertebrates, sex chromosome-autosome fusions resulting in neo-sex chromosomes occur frequently in male heterogametic taxa (XX/XY), but are rare in groups with female heterogamety (WZ/ZZ). We examined sex chromosomes of seven pests of the diverse lepidopteran superfamily Gelechioidea and confirmed the presence of neo-sex chromosomes in their karyotypes. Two synteny blocks, which correspond to autosomes 7 (LG7) and 27 (LG27) in the ancestral lepidopteran karyotype exemplified by the linkage map of Biston betularia (Geometridae), were identified as sex-linked in the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Gelechiidae). Testing for sex-linkage performed in other species revealed that while LG7 fused to sex chromosomes in a common ancestor of all Gelechioidea, the second fusion between the resulting neo-sex chromosome and the other autosome is confined to the tribe Gnoreschemini (Gelechiinae). Our data accentuate an emerging pattern of high incidence of neo-sex chromosomes in Lepidoptera, the largest clade with WZ/ZZ sex chromosome system, which suggest that the paucity of neo-sex chromosomes is not an intrinsic feature of female heterogamety. Furthermore, LG7 contains one of the major clusters of UDP-glucosyltransferases, which are involved in the detoxification of plant secondary metabolites. Sex chromosome evolution in Gelechioidea thus supports an earlier hypothesis postulating that lepidopteran sex chromosome-autosome fusions can be driven by selection for association of Z-linked preference or host-independent isolation genes with larval performance and thus can contribute to ecological specialization and speciation of moths.",Ancient Polyploidy and Genome Evolution in Palms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028709,Genome biology and evolution,2019 06 10,"Mechanisms of genome evolution are fundamental to our understanding of adaptation and the generation and maintenance of biodiversity, yet genome dynamics are still poorly characterized in many clades. Strong correlations between variation in genomic attributes and species diversity across the plant tree of life suggest that polyploidy or other mechanisms of genome size change confer selective advantages due to the introduction of genomic novelty. Palms (order Arecales, family Arecaceae) are diverse, widespread, and dominant in tropical ecosystems, yet little is known about genome evolution in this ecologically and economically important clade. Here, we take a phylogenetic comparative approach to investigate palm genome dynamics using genomic and transcriptomic data in combination with a recent, densely sampled, phylogenetic tree. We find conclusive evidence of a paleopolyploid event shared by the ancestor of palms but not with the sister clade, Dasypogonales. We find evidence of incremental chromosome number change in the palms as opposed to one of recurrent polyploidy. We find strong phylogenetic signal in chromosome number, but no signal in genome size, and further no correlation between the two when correcting for phylogenetic relationships. Palms thus add to a growing number of diverse, ecologically successful clades with evidence of whole-genome duplication, sister to a species-poor clade with no evidence of such an event. Disentangling the causes of genome size variation in palms moves us closer to understanding the genomic conditions facilitating adaptive radiation and ecological dominance in an evolutionarily successful, emblematic tropical clade.",Shared signature dynamics tempered by local fluctuations enables fold adaptability and specificity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028708,Molecular biology and evolution,2019 06 10,"Recent studies have drawn attention to the evolution of protein dynamics, in addition to sequence and structure, based on the premise structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. Of interest is to understand how functional differentiation is accomplished while maintaining the fold, or how intrinsic dynamics plays out in the evolution of structural variations and functional specificity. We performed a systematic computational analysis of 26,899 proteins belonging to 116 CATH superfamilies. Characterising cooperative mechanisms and convergent/divergent features that underlie the shared/differentiated dynamics of family members required a methodology that lends itself to efficient analyses of large ensembles of proteins. We therefore introduced, SignDy, an integrated pipeline for evaluating the signature dynamics of families based on elastic network models. Our analysis confirmed that family members share conserved, highly cooperative (global) modes of motion. Importantly, our analysis discloses a subset of motions that sharply distinguishes subfamilies, which lie in a low-to-intermediate frequency (LTIF) regime of the mode spectrum. This regime has maximal impact on functional differentiation of families into subfamilies, while being evolutionarily conserved among subfamily members. Notably, the high frequency (HF) end of the spectrum also reveals evolutionary conserved features across and within subfamilies; but in sharp contrast to global motions, HF modes are minimally collective. Modulation of robust/conserved global dynamics by LTIF fluctuations thus emerges as a versatile mechanism ensuring the adaptability of selected folds and the specificity of their subfamilies. SignDy further allows for dynamics-based categorization as a new layer of information relevant to distinctive mechanisms of action of subfamilies, beyond sequence or structural classifications.",Agreement between ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring in detecting night-time hypertension and nondipping patterns in the general population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028705,American journal of hypertension,2019 04 27,"Night-time blood pressure (BP) and nondipping pattern are strongly associated with hypertensive end-organ damage.

In this study, we sequenced tumor-inducing (Ti) and opine-catabolic (OC) plasmids in three Rhizobium rhizogenes (Agrobacterium biovar 2) strains isolated from the same crown gall tumor on ""Colt"" cherry rootstock and conducted comparative genomic analyses. Tumorigenic strains C5.7 and C6.5 carry nopaline-type Ti plasmids pTiC5.7/pTiC6.5, whereas the nonpathogenic strain Colt5.8 carries the nopaline-type OC plasmid pOC-Colt5.8. Overall, comparative genomic analysis indicated that pTiC5.7/pTiC6.5 and related Ti plasmids described before (pTiC58 and pTi-SAKURA) originate from a common ancestor, although they have diverged during evolution. On the other hand, plasmid pOC-Colt5.8 was most closely related to the well-known OC plasmid pAtK84b; however, analysis suggested that they had different evolutionary histories and seem to share a more distant common ancestor. Although the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Ti and OC plasmids is still speculative, we hypothesized that nopaline-type Ti plasmid might originate from the nopaline-type OC plasmid. Our results suggested that OC plasmids are widespread and closely associated with crown gall tumors. Finally, we proposed a thorough scheme for classification of Ti and OC plasmids that is based on separate comparative analysis of each functional element of the plasmid studied.",HIV-1 Phylodynamics to Detect and Characterize Active Transmission Clusters in North Carolina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028702,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 04 27,HIV-1 phylodynamics can be used to monitor epidemic trends and help target prevention through identification and characterization of transmission clusters.,Contamination of eggs by Salmonella Enteritidis in experimentally infected laying hens of four commercial genetic lines in conventional cages and enriched colony housing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028700,Poultry science,2019 04 27,"Human illness caused by the consumption of eggs contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis is a continuing international public health concern. This pathogen is deposited inside the edible contents of eggs as a consequence of its ability to colonize reproductive tissues in infected hens. Conditions in the housing environment can influence the persistence and transmission of avian Salmonella infections, but the food safety ramifications of different poultry management systems are not entirely clear. The present study assessed the deposition of S. Enteritidis inside eggs laid by groups of experimentally infected laying hens of 4 commercial genetic lines (designated as white egg lines W1 and W2 and brown egg lines B1 and B2). Groups of hens from each line were housed at 555 cm2 of floor space per bird in both conventional cages and colony units enriched with access to perches and nesting areas. All hens were orally inoculated with 5.75 × 107 cfu of a 2-strain S. Enteritidis mixture, and the internal contents of eggs laid 5 to 24 D post-inoculation were cultured to detect the pathogen. No significant differences in egg contamination frequencies were found between the 2 housing systems for any of the hen lines. Contaminated eggs were laid between 7 and 21 D post-inoculation at an overall frequency of 2.47%, ranging from 0.25 to 4.38% for the 4 hen lines. The frequency of S. Enteritidis recovery from egg samples was significantly (P < 0.05) lower for line B2 than for any of the other lines, and the egg contamination frequency for line W1 was significantly greater than for line W2. The overall incidence of contamination among white eggs (3.38%) was significantly higher than among brown eggs (1.56%). These results demonstrate that S. Enteritidis deposition inside eggs can vary between genetic lines of infected laying hens, but housing these hens in 2 different systems did not affect the production of contaminated eggs.",Methodologic considerations for measuring energy expenditure differences between diets varying in carbohydrate using the doubly labeled water method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028699,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2019 05 08,"Low-carbohydrate diets have been reported to significantly increase human energy expenditure when measured using doubly labeled water (DLW) but not by respiratory chambers.

Because aneuploidy simultaneously affects many genes, it has the potential to confer multiple phenotypes to the same cells. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms by which Candida albicans, the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, acquires the ability to survive both chemotherapeutic agents and antifungal drugs. Strikingly, adaptation to both types of drugs was accompanied by the acquisition of specific whole-chromosome aneuploidies, with some aneuploid karyotypes recovered independently and repeatedly from very different drug conditions. Specifically, strains selected for survival in hydroxyurea, an anticancer-drug, acquired cross-adaption to caspofungin, a first-line antifungal drug, and both acquired traits were attributable to trisomy of the same chromosome: loss of trisomy was accompanied by loss of adaptation to both drugs. Mechanistically, aneuploidy simultaneously altered the copy number of most genes on chromosome 2, yet survival in hydroxyurea or caspofungin required different genes and stress response pathways. Similarly, chromosome 5 monosomy conferred increased tolerance to both fluconazole and to caspofungin, antifungals with different mechanisms of action. Thus, the potential for cross-adaptation is not a feature of aneuploidy per se; rather, it is dependent on specific genes harbored on given aneuploid chromosomes. Furthermore, pre-exposure to hydroxyurea increased the frequency of appearance of caspofungin survivors, and hydroxyurea-adapted C. albicans cells were refractory to antifungal drug treatment in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. This highlights the potential clinical consequences for the management of cancer chemotherapy patients at risk of fungal infections.",Divergent Fine-Scale Recombination Landscapes between a Freshwater and Marine Population of Threespine Stickleback Fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028697,Genome biology and evolution,2019 06 16,"Meiotic recombination is a highly conserved process that has profound effects on genome evolution. At a fine-scale, recombination rates can vary drastically across genomes, often localized into small recombination ""hotspots"" with highly elevated rates, surrounded by regions with little recombination. In most species studied, the location of hotspots within genomes is highly conserved across broad evolutionary timescales. The main exception to this pattern is in mammals, where hotspot location can evolve rapidly among closely related species and even among populations within a species. Hotspot position in mammals is controlled by the gene, Prdm9, whereas in species with conserved hotspots, a functional Prdm9 is typically absent. Due to a limited number of species where recombination rates have been estimated at a fine-scale, it remains unclear whether hotspot conservation is always associated with the absence of a functional Prdm9. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model to examine the evolution of recombination over short evolutionary timescales. Using a linkage disequilibrium-based approach, we found recombination rates indeed varied at a fine-scale across the genome, with many regions organized into narrow hotspots. Hotspots had highly divergent landscapes between stickleback populations, where only ∼15% of these hotspots were shared. Our results indicate that fine-scale recombination rates may be diverging between closely related populations of threespine stickleback fish. Interestingly, we found only a weak association of a PRDM9 binding motif within hotspots, which suggests that threespine stickleback fish may possess a novel mechanism for targeting recombination hotspots at a fine-scale."

For one problem, thermal channels can operate at high temperatures, and for these channels, prolonged temperature stimulation incurs excessive thermal stress to destabilize patches. For another problem, conventional temperature controls are slow and limit the attainment of high resolution data such as time-resolved activations of thermal channels.

We conclude that competitive bodybuilders may benefit from consuming a higher protein intake than what is generally prescribed for recreationally trained lifters; however, the paucity of direct research in this population makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions on the topic.",Biomechanical Risk Factors Associated with Running-Related Injuries: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028658,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 06 10,"Running is a popular form of physical activity with many health benefits.

However, the analyses of such big datasets present a major challenge. During the last decade, a wide variety of strategies have been proposed covering different steps of the analysis. Here, we introduce a selection of computational tools to provide an overview of a generic analysis pipeline.The first step of every scRNA-Seq experiment is proper study design, which does not require sophisticated experimental or informatics skills but is nonetheless presumably the most important step. The quality of the resulting data strictly depends on the proper planning of the experiment, including the selection of the most suitable technology for the biological question of interest as well as an elaborated study design to minimize the influence of confounding factors. Once the experiment has been conducted, the raw sequencing data needs to be processed to extract the gene expression information for each cell. This task comprises quality assessment of the sequenced reads, alignment against a reference genome, demultiplexing of the cell barcodes, and quantification of the reads/transcripts per gene. As any other transcriptomics technology, single-cell mRNA-Seq requires data normalization to assure sample-to-sample, here cell-to-cell, comparability and the consideration of confounding factors.Once gene expression values have been extracted from the reads and normalized, the researcher has the agony of choosing between a plethora of analysis approaches to investigate diverse aspects of the single-cell transcriptomes, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering to explore cellular heterogeneity or trajectory analysis to model differentiation processes.In this chapter, we present a wrap-up of the abovementioned steps to conduct single-cell RNA-Seq analyses and present a selection of existing tools.",Differential Expression Analysis in Single-Cell Transcriptomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028652,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 03,"Differential expression analysis is an important aspect of bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq).

Comparative analysis of tools used to detect differentially expressed genes between two groups of single cells showed that edgeR with quasi-likelihood F-test (QLF) outperforms other methods.In bulk RNAseq, differential expression is mainly used to compare limited number of replicates of two or more biological conditions. However, scRNAseq differential expression analysis might be also instrumental to identify the main players of cells subpopulation organization, thus requiring the use of multiple comparisons tools. Nowadays, edgeR is one of the few tools that are able to handle both zero inflated matrices and multiple comparisons.

The SEM-EDS and mapping and XRD results illustrated the microstructure of GAZCA: the homogeneous aggregation of zeolite and AMBO nanoparticles with their crystal integrity and the uniform distribution of Al/Mn/Si/O elements on the adsorbent surface. FTIR and XPS results demonstrated the existence of impregnated sodium cations and hydroxyl groups, which were responsible for the removal of NH3-N and P, respectively. The results of BET analysis and compression tests exhibited a high surface area (14.4 m2/g) and a satisfactory mechanical strength of GAZCA. Kinetic adsorption results showed a fast adsorption rate for NH3-N and P, and mutual inference was not observed between the adsorption kinetics of NH3-N and P in the bi-component system. The adsorption isotherm results demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacities of NH3-N and P were calculated as 12.9 mg/g and 9.3 mg/g via the Langmuir model, respectively. In the bi-component system, the adsorption capacities of NH3-N and P were maintained at low and moderate concentrations and decreased at high concentrations due to the blockage effects of NH4MnPO4·H2O precipitates. The removal efficiency of NH3-N could be maintained in a wide pH range of 4~10, while P adsorption was inhibited at alkali conditions. The solution of sodium bicarbonate (0.4 M) was used for the regeneration of saturated adsorbents, which permitted GAZCA to keep 98% and 78% of its adsorption capacity for NH3-N and P even after three regeneration and reuse cycles. Dynamic experiments illustrated that a satisfactory performance was obtained for the in situ treatment of simulated N- and P-contaminated water by using a column reactor packed with GAZCA, thus further confirming its great potential for the control of eutrophication.",Two-Year Outcomes After Aquablation Compared to TURP: Efficacy and Ejaculatory Improvements Sustained.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028614,Advances in therapy,2019 05 24,To compare 2-year safety and efficacy outcomes after Aquablation or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).,Xyloglucan exoglycosidases in the monocot model Brachypodium distachyon and the conservation of xyloglucan disassembly in angiosperms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028613,Plant molecular biology,2019 04 27,"Brachypodium distachyon has a full set of exoglycosidases active on xyloglucan, including α-xylosidase, β-galactosidase, soluble and membrane-bound β-glucosidases and two α-fucosidases. However, unlike in Arabidopsis, both fucosidases are likely cytosolic. Xyloglucan is present in primary walls of all angiosperms. While in most groups it regulates cell wall extension, in Poaceae its role is still unclear. Five exoglycosidases participate in xyloglucan hydrolysis in Arabidopsis: α-xylosidase, β-galactosidase, α-fucosidase, soluble β-glucosidase and GPI-anchored β-glucosidase. Mutants in the corresponding genes show alterations in xyloglucan composition. In this work putative orthologs in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon were tested for their ability to complement Arabidopsis mutants. Xylosidase and galactosidase mutants were complemented, respectively, by BdXYL1 (Bd2g02070) and BdBGAL1 (Bd2g56607). BdBGAL1, unlike other xyloglucan β-galactosidases, is able to remove both galactoses from XLLG oligosaccharides. In addition, soluble β-glucosidase BdBGLC1 (Bd1g08550) complemented a glucosidase mutant. Closely related BdBGLC2 (Bd2g51280), which has a putative GPI-anchor sequence, was found associated with the plasma membrane and only a truncated version without GPI-anchor complemented the mutant, proving that Brachypodium also has soluble and membrane-bound xyloglucan glucosidases. Both BdXFUC1 (Bd3g25226) and BdXFUC2 (Bd1g28366) can hydrolyze fucose from xyloglucan oligosaccharides but were unable to complement a fucosidase mutant. Fluorescent protein fusions of BdXFUC1 localized to the cytosol and both proteins lack a signal peptide. Signal peptides appear to have evolved only in some eudicot lineages of this family, like the one leading to Arabidopsis. These results could be explained if cytosolic xyloglucan α-fucosidases are the ancestral state in angiosperms, with fucosylated oligosaccharides transported across the plasma membrane.",Prognostic impact of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 expression on monocytes in Egyptian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028612,Immunologic research,2019 04 27,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a role in chronic inflammation. Still, little is known about the expression of TLRs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we tried to assess the prognostic value of TLR2 and TLR4 expression on circulating monocytes in HCC patients and correlate their levels with some clinical, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes. Forty patients with hepatic focal lesions diagnosed radiologically as HCC by triphasic multislice CT pelviabdominal and chest, and in some patients MRI diffusion and 38 age and sex matching healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Subjects were evaluated for liver functions, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), imaging, response to different treatments, and overall survival. TLR2 and TLR4 expression by monocytes was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 on monocytes was significantly increased in HCC patients than the controls, in patients with more progressive HCC than those with lower progression and in patients with poor response to treatment than patients with better treatment response. Moreover, their levels showed positive correlations with ALT, AST, and AFP and inverse correlations with the overall survival of HCC patients. The results of the current study suggest that increased expression ofTLR2 and TLR4 on peripheral monocytes might reflect the development and progression of HCC and can be used to indicate poor prognosis. In addition, high expression of TLR2 correlated significantly with poor response to treatment, while high expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 were associated with poor survival. Our findings will help to design more studies on the role of TLRs in HCC pathogenesis and prognosis which may provide new therapeutic targets for HCC.","NMR assignment of free 1H, 15N and 13C-Grb2-SH2 domain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028611,Biomolecular NMR assignments,2019 04 27,"Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) is an adaptor protein composed of three domains, an N-terminal SH3 (nSH3), SH2 and a C-terminal SH3 (cSH3) domains.

Objective To evaluate the adverse effects in renal transplant recipients under mycophenolate treatment with respect to gender. Setting University Clinical Centre of Nis, Clinic of Nephrology, Serbia. Method This research included 96 renal transplant recipients, who received immunosuppressive regimen, based on tacrolimus or cyclosporin A, prednisone and mycophenolic acid. The high-performance liquid chromatography method combined with protein precipitation was used for the analysis of mycophelate concentration in human plasma. Drug concentration and dose-adjusted concentration were determined with respect to the patients' gender. An adverse effect scoring system developed by nephrologists within the University of Buffalo Nephrology/Transplant Program was used to monitor adverse effects of therapy. Main outcome measure Individual and scores of adverse effects in relation to the dosing regimen and gender. Results Results showed statistically lower dose and concentrations in men compared to the women in our investigation group. Also, female patients demonstrated higher mean scores (cumulative and subscores) within the same dosing regimens of mycophenolic acid.

Hospital pharmacists can record changes to medications in the electronic discharge note to improve the quality of this information for primary care. Objective To audit the pharmacist-completed notes describing changes to admission medication, and to identify improvement opportunities. Setting 750-bed teaching district general hospital in England. Methods An evaluation of pharmacist written notes was conducted at a 750-bed teaching district general hospital in England. A sample of notes was analysed in three consecutive years, 2016-2018. Analyses were performed using descriptive statistics. Main outcome measure The number of discrepancies in the note compared to the discharge summary medication list. Results Notes were analysed for 125, 120 and 120 patients in 2016-2018 respectively. We saw an overall improvement in the accuracy of our notes from 12% of patients having an inaccurate note in 2016 to 4.2% in 2017 and 5.8% in 2018. The percentage of discharge medicines affected by these discrepancies reduced from 1.7% (2016) to 0.6% (2017) and 0.9% (2018). Conclusion Discrepancies were due to changes in the patient's medicines journey not being fully captured and documented. The overall reduction of discrepancies over the three consecutive audits was felt to be largely due to formalisation of the discharge medicines reconciliation process and reminding staff on how to complete a note. We are planning to utilise informatics surveillance tools along with system developments to sustain this elimination of out of date notes being transmitted to primary care.",Perceived sensitivity to medicines: a study among chronic medicine users in Norway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028593,International journal of clinical pharmacy,2019 06 10,"Background Little is known about patients' Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines (PSM), ""the belief that one is especially sensitive to the actions and side effects of medicines"". Objective (i) To explore the extent of and factors associated with high Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines in a Norwegian population of chronic medicine users; (ii) to assess the psychometric characteristics of the tool to measure PSM. Setting Community pharmacies in the Oslo area, Norway. Method A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted between October 2015 and January 2016. Patients filling prescriptions for chronic disorders were recruited. Main outcome measure Perceived sensitivity to medicines. Results The study population included 214 patients (response rate 36.7%). In total 20.1% of the patients reported low, 61.7% moderate and 18.2% high perceived sensitivity to medicines. Factors positively associated with high perceived sensitivity were female gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 5.33, 95% CI 1.52 to 18.72, p < 0.001) and having a non-native language (aOR 4.76, 95% CI 1.48 to 15.30, p < 0.001); lower educational level (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.07, p < 0.001) and using generic medicines (aOR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with high perceived sensitivity to medicines. There was no association between the perceived sensitivity and the number of prescription medicines taken. The Norwegian version of the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines tool demonstrated good psychometric characteristics. Conclusion Almost one out of five patients in this study reported high sensitivity to medicines. Female gender, having a non-native language, lower educational level and using generic medicines were important factors related to the perceived sensitivity. Health care providers should be aware of the impact negative expectations about medicines can have on health behaviors and treatment outcomes, and seek to elicit and address patients' beliefs about their personal sensitivity to medicines.",Mood Disorders in High-Functioning Autism: The Importance of Alexithymia and Emotional Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028592,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 04 27,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have co-morbid anxiety and depression. Alexithymia and emotion regulation difficulties are commonly seen in individuals with ASD and in mood disorders. We hypothesized that alexithymia and emotional regulation would mediate the relationship between autistic features and anxiety/depression symptom severity. We collected data about emotional regulation, alexithymia, autistic symptoms and depression/anxiety in a sample of 64 young adults with ASD. We constructed two serial multiple mediator models, using autistic features as the independent variable and anxiety/depression symptoms as outcome variables. The serial relationship between alexithymia and emotional regulation mediated associations between autistic features and depression and anxiety, separately. The findings suggest that targeting alexithymia may benefit therapies designed to alleviate mood disorders in ASD.",Two-pore physiologically based pharmacokinetic model with de novo derived parameters for predicting plasma PK of different size protein therapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028591,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,2019 06 10,"Two-pore PBPK models have been used for characterizing the PK of protein therapeutics since 1990s. However, widespread utilization of these models is hampered by the lack of a priori parameter values, which are typically estimated using the observed data. To overcome this hurdle, here we have presented the development of a two-pore PBPK model using de novo derived parameters. The PBPK model was validated using plasma PK data for different size proteins in mice. Using the ""two pore theory"" we were able to establish the relationship between protein size and key model parameters, such as: permeability-surface area product (PS), vascular reflection coefficient (σ), peclet number (Pe), and glomerular sieving coefficient (θ). The model accounted for size dependent changes in tissue extravasation and glomerular filtration. The model was able to a priori predict the PK of 8 different proteins: IgG (150 kDa), scFv-Fc (105 kDa), F(ab)2 (100 kDa, minibody (80 kDa), scFv2 (55 kDa), Fab (50 kDa), diabody (50 kDa), scFv (27 kDa), and nanobody (13 kDa). In addition, the model was able to provide unprecedented quantitative insight into the relative contribution of convective and diffusive pathway towards trans-capillary mass transportation of different size proteins. The two-pore PBPK model was also able to predict systemic clearance (CL) versus Molecular Weight relationship for different size proteins reasonably well. As such, the PBPK model proposed here represents a bottom-up systems PK model for protein therapeutics, which can serve as a generalized platform for the development of truly translational PBPK model for protein therapeutics.","Number, Proliferative Activity, and Expression of Thyroid Hormone Receptors in Dermal Fibroblasts in Mice with Changed Thyroid Status.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028589,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 05 07,"We studied the intensity of age-specific changes in the dermis (number and proliferative activity of fibroblasts) in mice with normal and experimentally changed level of thyroid hormones. Receptors of thyroid hormones, TR-α and TR-β, in mouse dermal fibroblasts were identified by immunohistochemical methods. The relative expression of Thra, Thrb, and Dio2 genes was assessed by real-time PCR analysis. From the second to fifth month of life, the number of fibroblasts in the connective tissue layer of mouse skin decreased by 42.3%. The number of fibroblasts in the dermis of 5-month-old mice treated with Thyrozol significantly decreases by 25.9% (p<0.05), and vice versa, in mice receiving thyroxin this parameter increased by 4.7% in comparison with the control (p>0.05). TR-α and TR-β were identified in dermal fibroblasts in all groups of mice. No differences in the content TR-α and Thra gene expression in 2- and 5-month-old mice of the control and experimental were revealed. TR-β content in dermal fibroblasts of 2-month-old animals was maximum and exceeded this value in 5-month-old control mice by 25%. The number of these receptors decreased by 33.3% in mice treated with Thyrozol and increased by 25% in animals receiving thyroxin injection in comparison with the control. Relative expression of Thrb gene significantly increased only in mice treated with thyroxin. Comparative analysis of the relative expression of Dio2 gene revealed no differences between the experimental and control groups. Changes in the level of thyroid hormones, content of TR-β, and relative Thrb gene expression contribute to agerelated shifts in the number and proliferative activity of mouse dermal fibroblasts.",Growth and Persistence of Campylobacter jejuni in Foodstuffs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028588,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 05 07,"Campylobacter genus bacteria causing campylobacteriasis are difficult to culture. This fact necessitates creation of special approaches to studies of the behavior of these pathogens during the manufacture and storage of foodstuffs. The regularities of Campylobacter jejuni transition into an uncultivable state are studied under conditions simulating the process of immersion cooling of fresh poultry products. The proportion of viable colony-forming (CFU) cells to the total count of planktonic and uncultivable cells in the population was calculated by the level of genomic DNA in the samples evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR with intercalating dyes. PCR was carried out with primers detecting the cytolethal toxin subunit B gene cdtB and invasion gene ciaB in C. jejuni strains. The count of detected cells was 5-10-fold higher than the count of CFU; the cultural method failed to detect the agent in 40% analyzed samples of superficially infected products, while the level of uncultivable cells detected by PCR was significantly higher. The relationship between culturing conditions and formation of C. jejuni biofilms was studied. The most intensive formation of film exomatrix was observed under unfavorable conditions for this microorganism at 25oC. In microaerophilic gaseous medium, weak formation of films and intensive growth of C. jejuni populations were observed. Culturing at higher temperatures (37-42oC) was in fact inessential for the film formation process.",Neurodegenerative Changes in Rat Brain in Streptozotocin Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028587,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 05 07,"One of the most common models of sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease is injection of streptozotocin into the lateral ventricles of rat brain. In 3 months after this injection, an increase in the expression of astroglia in the corpus callosum and a decrease in the thickness of the corpus callosum and intensity of its staining with luxol fast blue were observed. This can reflect a decrease in the content of myelinated fibers. In layer V of the sensorimotor cortex, intensive degeneration of neurons was revealed. The lateral ventricles were significantly enlarged and the expression of PSA-NCAM protein, a marker of immature neurons, was reduced in subventricular zone, which can be associated with disturbed neurogenesi.",Markers of Systemic Inflammation in Experimental Dyslipidemia Induced by P-407: Modulation with Fucoidan from Brown Alga Fucus evanescens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028586,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 05 07,"The effect of sulfated polysaccharide from brown alga Fucus evanescens (fucoidan) administered via different routes (peroral and parenteral) on the dynamic of some lipid metabolism parameters and markers of systemic inflammation in mice with experimental dyslipidemia induced by prolonged administration of poloxamer P-407. It was found that fucoidan corrected the main parameters of lipid metabolism, reduced the level of endothelial dysfunction marker endothelin-1 and proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IFNγ in blood serum in animals with experimental dyslipidemia. These findings open prospects for using fucoidan in the complex treatment of metabolic disorders and atherosclerotic inflammation.",Influence of Sialadenectomy on the Development of Spermatogenesis in Rats: Ultrastructural Characteristics of Spermatogenic Epithelium and Leydig Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028585,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 05 07,"Sialadenectomy in young rats modifies the development of the spermatogenic and steroidogenic functions of the testes.

During chest X-ray he suddenly collapsed and died. Autopsy revealed a large atherosclerotic saccular thoracic aortic aneurysm whose right lateral wall firmly adhered to the right lung. There was more than 2.5 l of blood with fibrin deposits in the right part of the thoracic cavity. The right bronchus contained a cast of blood; blood was also present in the trachea and the distal airways of the right lung. Further dissection revealed that the aneurysm had eroded the tissue surrounding it and made a fistulous canal into the lower lobe of the right lung, causing the lung to fill with fluid blood. The cause of death was hemorrhage from the aortopulmonary fistula caused by pressure necrosis from the thoracic aortic aneurysm.",The risk of assault against mental health professionals: a fatal case report and literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028573,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 05 22,"Assaults by patients against healthcare providers are an increasing phenomenon worldwide. Mental health professionals in acute facilities and rehabilitation wards have the highest risk of being attacked at work. Verbal abuse or intimidating behaviors represent the most common types of violence. Fatal assault by psychiatric patients has been rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of a female psychiatrist who was fatally stabbed in her office in a Mental Health Center. At autopsy seventy stab wounds were found: four wounds of the neck, fifty penetrating wounds of the thorax, three wounds of the abdomen, six wounds of the lumbar region, and seven wounds of the upper arms including defense injuries. The cause of death was massive blood loss due to multiple stab wounds. The perpetrator was a 44-year-old male patient who had been referred to the victim after a previous admission to hospital following experiences of suicidal ideation and confusion. The extreme and unmotivated violence in a non-acute setting were notable. A borderline-antisocial personality disorder was later diagnosed by forensic experts. This case emphasizes the significant occupational risk for mental healthcare staff to sustain life threatening injuries or death, with implications for training of clinicians, and strategies for preventing aggressive behaviors.",Characterization of H/D exchange in type 1 pili by proton-detected solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028572,Journal of biomolecular NMR,2019 04 27,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli invades and colonizes hosts by attaching to cells using adhesive pili on the bacterial surface. Although many biophysical techniques have been used to study the structure and mechanical properties of pili, many important details are still unknown. Here we use proton-detected solid-state NMR experiments to investigate solvent accessibility and structural dynamics. Deuterium back-exchange at labile sites of the perdeuterated, fully proton back-exchanged pili was conducted to investigate hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange patterns of backbone amide protons in pre-assembled pili. We found distinct H/D exchange patterns in lateral and axial intermolecular interfaces in pili. Amide protons protected from H/D exchange in pili are mainly located in the core region of the monomeric subunit and in the lateral intermolecular interface, whereas the axial intermolecular interface and the exterior region of pili are highly exposed to H/D exchange. Additionally, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the type 1 pilus rod and estimated the probability of H/D exchange based on hydrogen bond dynamics. The comparison of the experimental observables and simulation data provides insights into stability and mechanical properties of pili.",Cyclin-dependent Kinase 18 Promotes Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Differentiation through Activating the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028571,Neuroscience bulletin,2019 04 27,"The correct differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is essential for the myelination and remyelination processes in the central nervous system. Determining the regulatory mechanism is fundamental to the treatment of demyelinating diseases. By analyzing the RNA sequencing data of different neural cells, we found that cyclin-dependent kinase 18 (CDK18) is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes. In vivo studies showed that the expression level of CDK18 gradually increased along with myelin formation during development and in the remyelination phase in a lysophosphatidylcholine-induced demyelination model, and was distinctively highly expressed in oligodendrocytes. In vitro overexpression and interference experiments revealed that CDK18 directly promotes the differentiation of OPCs, without affecting their proliferation or apoptosis. Mechanistically, CDK18 activated the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, thus promoting OPC differentiation. The results of the present study suggest that CDK18 is a promising cell-type specific target to treat demyelinating disease.",Enhancement of chemosensitivity in 5-fluorouracil-resistant colon cancer cells with carcinoembryonic antigen-specific RNA aptamer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028570,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 27,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers, and rates of incidence and diagnosis of CRC have gradually increased. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is overexpressed in patients with CRC and is associated with cell adhesion, anoikis resistance, and promotion of metastasis to the liver. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat cancer, including CRC. However, a major issue of 5-FU therapy is the occurrence of chemoresistance, and the fact that 5-FU induces CEA overexpression, which may induce the 5-FU resistance. We previously isolated a CEA-specific RNA aptamer that was able to inhibit hepatic metastasis of colon cancer cells in a mouse model. In the present study, we tested whether protecting CEA using the CEA aptamer could enhance 5-FU sensitivity in chemoresistant LS174T colon cancer cells. We observed that the CEA aptamer sensitized the 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cell line to 5-FU more than five-fold (IC50 ~ 5.995 μM), compared with cells treated with 5-FU alone (IC50 ~ 31.46 μM). Moreover, treatment with CEA aptamer combined with 5-FU synergistically regressed growth of chemoresistant tumors in mouse xenografted models. Combinatorial treatment of 5-FU and CEA aptamer augmented caspase-8 activity in the 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cell line via aptamer-mediated disruption of CEA interaction with death receptor 5 and in mouse xenograft tumors. In conclusion, CEA-specific aptamer improved 5-FU sensitivity in chemoresistant colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and thus represents a novel 5-FU adjuvant to overcome the chemoresistance in CRC patients.","Genome-wide identification, expression, and interaction analysis for ovate family proteins in peach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028569,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 27,"Ovate family proteins (OFPs), which are involved in aspects of plant development and growth, is a class of plant-specific transcription factors. Although OFPs have been reported in some species, little is known about their evolution, structure, fruit developmental expression, and interactions among OFP members in peach (Prunus persica). In this study, 15 peach OFP (PpOFP) genes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 716 OFPs from 32 species were divided into 15 subgroups; 10 subgroups (Ia, Ib, Ic, Id, Ie, If, Ig, Ih, Ii, and Ij) were composed of dicotyledonous plants only and five (IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, and IIe) were composed of monocotyledonous plants only. Structure analysis showed that the OFP genes in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants had no introns. Chromosomal localization analysis showed that 15 PpOFP genes were unevenly mapped on seven chromosomes. Furthermore, eight of the 15 PpOFP genes were cloned successfully by the RT-PCR method. To some extent, eight PpOFPs were expressed in all the detected peach tissues. In addition, analysis by Y2H and BiFC technologies indicated that both PpOFP4 and PpOFP5 formed homodimers with themselves, and PpOFP5 interacted with PpOFP7 or PpOFP8 to form heterodimers. These results serve as the theoretical basis for the analysis of the biological function and regulation of peach OFP transcription factors in the growth, development and other conditions, as well as evolution studies of OFP transcription factors in higher plants.",Peptide P11 suppresses the growth of human thyroid carcinoma by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028568,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 10,"Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy, and the incidence of thyroid carcinoma is increasing in recent decades. CYYGQSKYC (P6), a nonapeptide with anti-lymphangiogenic effect by its binding to VEGFR-3 and selectively inhibiting VEGF-C binding to VEGFR-3, could suppress the migration and invasion of cancer cells. LSPPRYP (P9) acts as an effective bFGF/FGFR antagonist and inhibits the growth of the murine melanoma B16-F10 cells. In order to increase the anti-tumor effects of P6 and P9, we connected P6 with P9 via a flexible linker Gly-Gly-Gly (GGG) to reconstruct a novel peptide P11, CYYGQSKYCGGGLSPPRYP. In the present study, the mechanism of action of peptide P11 on the growth of human thyroid carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo was determined. Our results showed that peptide P11 inhibited the proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion of human thyroid carcinoma cells. Peptide P11 increased the apoptosis and decreased the protein levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR in human thyroid carcinoma cells. In addition, P11 could effectively inhibit the growth of human thyroid carcinoma xenograft tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, peptide P11 could inhibit the growth of human thyroid carcinoma by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Novel peptides can be designed and applied for the treatment of various types of cancer.",Utility of left atrial strain for predicting atrial fibrillation following ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028567,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2019 04 27,"Twenty-five percent of ischemic strokes (IS) are cryptogenic, but it is estimated that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is the underlying cause in up to a third of cases. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of speckle tracking of the left atrium (LA) in diagnosing PAF in IS patients. We retrospectively studied 186 IS patients with a clinical echocardiographic examination during sinus rhythm. Outcome was PAF defined by at least one reported episode of AF following their IS. Conventional echocardiographic measures were performed. Global longitudinal strain (GLS), LA reservoir-(εs), conduit-(εe), contraction-strain (εa) and LA dyssynchrony (standard deviation of time-to-peak εs; LA SD-T2P) were obtained by left ventricular and LA speckle tracking. Of 186 patients, 28 (15%) were diagnosed with PAF. PAF-patients did not differ from non-PAF patients with regards to GLS nor SD-TPS, but atrial strain measures were significantly impaired at baseline (εs 27 vs. 35%, εe 12 vs. 16%, εa 15 vs. 18%, p < 0.02 for all, for PAF and non-PAF, respectively). However, only εs remained independently associated with PAF after adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic parameters (OR 1.13 [1.04; 1.22], p = 0.003, per 1% decrease). εs also provided the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve among all variables (AUC = 0.74). With a cutoff of 29%, εs had a specificity of 76% and a negative predictive value of 93%. Atrial reservoir strain is independently associated with PAF and may be used to improve the diagnosis of PAF following IS.",Impaired autophagy mediates hyperhomocysteinemia-induced HA-VSMC phenotypic switching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028566,Journal of molecular histology,2019 04 27,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a highly-related risk factor in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic modulation and atherosclerosis. Growing evidence indicated that autophagy is involved in pathological arterial changes. However, the risk mechanisms by which homocysteine and VSMC autophagy interact with cardiovascular disease are poorly understood. This study verified the homocysteine-responsive endoplasmic reticulum protein promotion of VSMC phenotypic switching, and the formation of atherosclerotic plaque in vitro. We found that impaired autophagy, as evidenced by decreased levels of MAP1LC3B II/MAP1LC3B I, has a vital role in HHcy-induced human aortic (HA)-VSMC phenotypic switching, with a decrease in contractile proteins (SM α-actin and calponin) and an increase in osteopontin. Knockdown of the essential autophagy gene Atg7 by small interfering RNA promoted HA-VSMC phenotypic switching, indicating that impaired autophagy induces phenotypic switching in these cells. HHcy co-treatment with rapamycin triggered autophagy, which alleviated HA-VSMC phenotypic switching. Finally, we found that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc-finger transcription factor for maintaining genomic stability by resisting oxidative stress and restoring autophagy, is closely involved in this process. HHcy clearly decreased KLF4 expression. KLF4-specific siRNA aggravated defective autophagy and phenotypic switching. Mechanistically, KLF4 regulated the HHcy-induced decrease in HA-VSMC autophagy via the m-TOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the KLF4-dependent rapamycin signaling pathway is a novel mechanism underlying HA-VSMC phenotypic switching and is crucial for HHcy-induced HA-VSMCs with defective autophagy to accelerate early atherosclerosis.",Asymmetric dimethylation and citrullination of proteinic arginine and homoarginine synthesis in human Helicobacter pylori infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028565,Amino acids,2019 05 29,"The importance of L-arginine (Arg) and relatives, including L-homoarginine (hArg) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), in humans infected with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is little understood. ADMA is produced by asymmetric dimethylation of the guanidine group of Arg residues in certain proteins and is released by proteolysis. High concentrations of circulating free ADMA are considered a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in adults. This risk is considered to arise from the inhibition of the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In the present study, we quantified by stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) the concentration of free (f) and total (t) ADMA, Arg, hArg, lysine (Lys) and the sum of citrulline (Cit) and ornithine (Orn) (6 M HCl, 20 h, 110 °C) in serum samples of apparently healthy elderly subjects (n = 27; age, 31-105 years) who were tested for Hp infection. Nine subjects (5 males, 4 females) were found to be Hp seropositive (Hp+) and 18 subjects (8 males, 9 females) were found to be Hp seronegative (Hp‒). Proteinic (p) concentrations were determined by difference. fADMA (0.493 ± 0.068 vs 0.466 ± 0.081 µM, P = 0.382), pADMA (113 ± 73 vs 76 ± 59 nM, P = 0.169) and tADMA (0.606 ± 0.126 vs 0.543 ± 0.121 µM, P = 0.280) serum concentrations were found not to differ between the Hp+ and Hp- subjects. Serum concentrations of fArg (162 ± 30 vs 177 ± 36 µM, P = 0.471), fhArg (1.600 ± 0.638 vs 1.831 ± 0.742 µM, P = 0.554), and fLys (388 ± 170 vs 395 ± 149 µM, P = 0.700) also did not differ statistically between Hp+ and Hp- subjects. tArg (12.4 ± 1.49 vs 13.0 ± 1.33 mM, P = 0.190), tLys (23.0 ± 2.65 vs. 23.9 ± 2.66 mM, P = 0.456) and tCit + Orn (2.53 ± 0.76 vs 2.63 ± 0.85 mM, P = 0.817) did not differ between Hp+and Hp‒ subjects as well. phArg concentration was close to the limit of quantitation of the method (Hp+: 30 ± 210 nM; Hp-: 42 ± 205 nM), suggesting that hArg is virtually absent in serum proteins of the investigated subjects. pCit + Orn did not differ between infected and non-infected subjects. Our study suggests that Hp infection is not associated with elevated asymmetric dimethylation and citrullination of Arg proteins present in the serum or with the hArg synthesis from free Arg in elderly subjects. However, asymmetric Arg dimethylation was found to correlate inversely with Arg citrullination in Hp- (r2 = 0.408, P = 0.004) but not in Hp+ (r2 = 0.065, P = 0.506), with Arg citrullination decreasing and Arg asymmetric dimethylation increasing with subjects' age."

This requires a long-lasting power supply to make implantable devices cost-effective and efficient. Since the current trend is to implant catheter-free stand-alone electrodes (implantable cardiac monitors), the need for smaller devices is at odds with the need for long-life batteries. To avoid these problems, we propose a passive endocardial sensor able to monitor the movement of the considered chamber based on a permanent magnet shaped for implantation in the internal chamber of the heart (i.e. the right atrium) and an external gauss meter unit to measure sensor-induced magnetic field variations. Since the magnet is permanent, no replacement is needed after the first implant, thereby reducing the risks linked to invasive procedures, and the battery in the external device can be substituted more easily. To test our idea we used a permanent magnet mounted on the tip of a commercial catheter for heart mapping together with a dedicated gauss meter built in our laboratory. The device was tested in vitro and the magnetic field variations were acquired and measured in different conditions of movement and distances. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and open an interesting new scenario where permanent magnets can be used to monitor the mechanical behaviour of the heart.",Structural characterization and heterologous expression of a new cyt gene cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028552,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 05 21,"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains produce Cry (crystal) and Cyt (cytolytic) proteins belonging to the group of bacterial toxins known as pore-forming toxins (PFTs), which interact with midgut cells of target insects to create pores, disruption of ion homeostasis and eventual death. PFTs have synergistic insecticidal activities and have been used as biopesticides against agriculturally important insects. Identification of new Cyt proteins is important because of their specific toxicity towards hemipteran pests, against which the Cry proteins are not effective. We have structurally characterized a cyt (cyt1007) gene from an Indian Bt isolate SK-1007. The presence of a ""Bacillus thuringiensis toxin"" domain and maximum identity of 36% with Cyt2Ca in the deduced amino acid sequence indicated Cyt1007 protein to be a new member of Cyt family. Three dimensional (3D) modeling (PMDB ID: PM0081490) revealed that it adopts a typical ferredoxin-like fold, and is composed of a single domain of α/β architecture, in which a single β sheet is surrounded by two α helical layers. The putative lipid binding site and probable mode of action of Cyt1007 protein were predicted through comparative analysis with other Cyt toxins and their distant homologs Evf (Erwinia virulence factor) and VVA2 (Volvatoxin A2). Heterologous expression of cyt1007 gene as a 25 kDa protein in Escherichia coli was achieved at high levels in both soluble and insoluble fractions. Affinity chromatography-based purification yielded 83.6% purified Cyt1007 protein, which can be used for downstream applications for the investigation of its toxicity.

During virion assembly, CA drives the formation of the hexameric lattice in immature viral particles, while in mature virions CA monomers assemble in cone-shaped cores surrounding the viral RNA genome and associated proteins. In addition to its functions in late stages of the viral replication cycle, CA plays key roles in a number of processes during early phases of HIV-1 infection including trafficking, uncoating, recognition by host cellular proteins and nuclear import of the viral pre-integration complex. As a result of efficient cooperation of CA with other viral and cellular proteins, integration of the viral genetic material into the host genome, which is an essential step for productive viral infection, successfully occurs. In this review, we will summarize available data on CA functions in HIV-1 replication, describing in detail its roles in late and early phases of the viral replication cycle.","Sleepless in Beirut: sleep duration and associated subjective sleep insufficiency, daytime fatigue, and sleep debt in an urban environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028521,Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2019 04 27,"Insufficient sleep is not well studied in developing countries.

Despite its constraints (overcrowding and unpredictable workload, in particular), the emergency department (ED) should be viewed as an opportune place for improving patient satisfaction and adherence to recommendations, and thus for preventing complications and early readmission, suggesting that better PE and health information could be one way to enhance patient safety. Building evidence on how best to organise and deliver effective PE poses many challenges, however. This paper gives an overview of the main issues (what we already know and prospects for research/clinical approaches) concerning PE in the ED: improving provider skills, ensuring PE continuity, developing educational materials, interprofessional collaboration, identifying specific educational needs for certain subgroups of patients, evaluating PE delivery, and identifying the most effective interventions. Future research will be needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for a comprehensive approach to PE."

In the past, pesticides usage was restricted to the cocoa, cotton, vegetables, and fruits sectors. Today, there is a widespread use of pesticides in the cultivation of yam. Since the introduction of pesticides into yam production, farmers have expressed satisfaction about the relief it has brought them with regard to labor and productivity. However, there has been public concern about the human and environmental health impacts of pesticides. In this study, 100 farmers were interviewed through a structured questionnaire to determine their knowledge, awareness, and use practices of pesticides and to determine their level of exposure. The study revealed that the common pesticides currently being used for yam production are herbicides. Although the farmers are aware of the risks associated with the use of pesticides, they use more than the recommended doses and do not pay attention to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) thereby predisposing themselves to the potential health effects of pesticides. A significant percentage (20 to 40%) of the farmers reported to have never used these PPEs and over 44% of them use glyphosate above the recommended dose (between 1.5 and 2 L/ha). This resulted in an average farmer exposure to glyphosate of 4.2 mg/kgBW/day, well above the acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.5 mg/kgBW/day. The government should develop and implement programs to train pesticides dealers, educate farmers, enforce the laws on pesticides, and support farmers to uphold protective measures.",Analysis of the effect of green roof substrate amended with biochar on water quality and quantity of rainfall runoff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028499,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 06 07,"Green roofs are becoming a popular ecological alternative in urban areas worldwide. In this study, we constructed two modular green roofs (commercial substrate green roof and biochar substrate green roof) and analyzed the effects that the green roof substrate amended with biochar on the runoff retention capacity, water quality, pollutants releasing characteristic, and pollution load by simulating rainfall experiment (rainfall levels 10~80 mm). Results showed that the mean retention ratio was no significant differences between the commercial substrate (72.54%) and the biochar substrate (72.08%). Both the two kinds of substrates showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and iron (Fe) decreased gradually with the extension of rainfall time. Electrical conductivity (EC) and pH, as well as mean concentrations of TN, COD, TP, total suspended solids (TSS), and Fe, showed no differences between the green roof runoff of two kind of substrate. However, the neutralizing capacity of biochar substrate for the pH of green roof runoff was stronger than the commercial substrate, and the mean concentration of the TN and COD in the commercial substrate (16.14 mg/L and 171.79 mg/L, respectively) was about two times higher than the biochar substrate (9.85 mg/L and 97.31 mg/L, respectively). Similarly, the pollution load of TN and COD in the commercial substrate was significantly higher than that in the biochar substrate. Therefore, the biochar substrate could effectively reduce the pollution load of TN and COD in the runoff of green roof. Consequently, we suggest that the biochar could be applied to green roof substrates in order to reduce the impact of city non-point pollution on receiving water bodies.",Colorimetric tyrosinase assay based on catechol inhibition of the oxidase-mimicking activity of chitosan-stabilized platinum nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028498,Mikrochimica acta,2019 06 10,"It is found that catechol inhibits the oxidase-mimicking activity of chitosan-protected platinum nanoparticles (Chit-PtNPs) by competing with the substrate for the active site of the Ch-PtNPs. The inhibition mechanism of catechol is different from that of ascorbic acid in that it neither reacts with O2•- nor reduces the oxidized 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Tyrosinase (TYRase) catalyzes the oxidation of catechol, thus restoring the activity of oxidase-mimicking Chit-PtNPs. By combining the Chit-PtNP, catechol, and TYRase interactions with the oxidation of TMB to form a yellow diamine (maximal absorbance at 450 nm), a colorimetric analytical method was developed for TYRase determination and inhibitor screening. The assay works in the 0.5 to 2.5 U·mL-1 TYRase activity range, and the limit of detection is 0.5 U·mL-1. In our perception, this new assay represents a powerful approach for determination of TYRase activity in biological samples.

Electronic questionnaires are increasingly used for collecting patient-reported-outcome (PRO) data about disease symptoms. Our aim was to leverage PRO data, collected to record COPD disease symptoms, in a general modelling framework to enable interpretation of PRO observations in relation to disease progression and potential to predict exacerbations. The data were collected daily over a year, in a prospective, observational study. The e-questionnaire, the EXAcerbations of COPD Tool (EXACT®) included 14 items (i.e. questions) with 4 or 5 ordered categorical response options. An item response theory (IRT) model was used to relate the responses from each item to the underlying latent variable (which we refer to as disease severity), and on each item level, Markov models (MM) with 4 or 5 categories were applied to describe the dependence between consecutive observations. Minimal continuous time MMs were used and parameterised using ordinary differential equations. One hundred twenty-seven COPD patients were included (median age 67 years, 54% male, 39% current smokers), providing approximately 40,000 observations per EXACT® item. The final model suggested that, with time, patients more often reported the same scores as the previous day, i.e. the scores were more stable.

Clotrimazole nanocrystals were optimized with studying the impact of individual process parameters of the media milling technique. The optimum level of individual process parameters was considered in the development of optimized batches. A promising result was obtained with a non-ionic stabilizer, polysorbate 80, at a concentration of 1.5%w/v, showing a distinct reduction in the particle size from above 31 μm to 264 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.211 with media milling at 1500 rpm for 6 h. This result was found to be in concordance with the TEM images, revealing a sharp diminution in particle morphology. Powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry results revealed crystallinity of clotrimazole (CTZ) in nanocrystal form. The optimized nanocrystal suspension was formulated into nanogel with carbopol 934, having a viscosity of 86.43 ± 2.06 Pa s at 25°C, which enhanced the ease of application of CTZ nanocrystals topically. A diffusion study showed around 82% of CTZ is transported across the membrane with the flux of 110.07 μg cm-2 h-1. In vivo results of the nanogel revealed improvement in CTZ release with 52% CTZ retention in different strata of the skin. The developed nanogel showed a significant improvement in the eradication of fungal infection within 10 days of application over Candida albicans-induced Wistar rat model. In a nutshell, the CTZ nanocrystal-loaded nanogel could achieve the goal of retaining CTZ in skin layers providing a prolonged effect and was able to treat cutaneous candidiasis in a short span with improved compliance for the candidiasis patients.",Application of Deep Learning Algorithm in Cervical Cancer MRI Image Segmentation Based on Wireless Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028491,Journal of medical systems,2019 06 13,"With the development of medical technology in China, new difficulties are gradually emerging in traditional medicine. Cervical cancer MRI image segmentation technology based on wireless network is one of the most famous means. But the traditional technology is not strong enough for information processing and analysis. Manual data processing alone may lead to errors in data processing and so on. Therefore, this research was aimed at the MRI image segmentation technology of cervical cancer based on wireless network, using depth learning algorithm to calculate and analyze. Through this kind of wireless network and the computer algorithm form, the data processing ability can be improved and increase the data processing ability be increased."

However, little is known about the richness and species composition of AM fungal communities associating with manioc and possible differences across soils and manioc landraces. We studied the diversity and composition of AM fungal communities present in the roots of different manioc landraces and surrounding soils in indigenous shifting cultivation fields on different Amazonian soil types. A total of 126 AM fungal virtual taxa (VT; phylogenetically defined taxonomic units) were recovered from soil and root samples using 454 sequencing of AM fungal SSU rRNA gene amplicons. Different AM fungal communities occurred in different soil types. Minor differences occurred in the composition of AM fungal community associating with different manioc landraces, but AM fungal richness was not different among them. There was a low similarity between the AM fungal communities colonizing manioc roots and those recorded in the soil, independently of differences in soil properties or the manioc landrace evaluated. Rhizophagus manihotis and Glomus VT126 were the most abundant AM fungal species colonizing manioc roots. Contrasting with the results of earlier spore-based investigations, all the AM fungi identified as indicator species of particular manioc landraces were morphologically unknown Glomus species. In conclusion, different manioc landraces growing in common conditions associated with distinct AM fungal communities, whereby AM fungal communities in soils did not necessarily reflect the AM fungal communities colonizing manioc roots.",Improvement in verbal learning over the first year of antipsychotic treatment is associated with serum HDL levels in a cohort of first episode psychosis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028479,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2019 04 27,"To investigate whether changes in serum lipids are associated with cognitive performance in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients during their first year of antipsychotic drug treatment. One hundred and thirty-two antipsychotic-treated FEP patients were included through the TOP study along with 83 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Information regarding cognitive performance, psychotic symptoms, lifestyle, body mass index, serum lipids [total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides] and antipsychotic treatment was obtained at baseline and after 1 year. The cognitive test battery is comprised of assessments for verbal learning, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency, and inhibition. Mixed-effects models were used to study the relationship between changes over time in serum lipids and cognitive domains, controlling for potential confounders. There was a significant group by HDL interaction effect for verbal learning (F = 11.12, p = 0.001), where an increase in HDL levels was associated with improvement in verbal learning in FEP patients but not in HC. Practice effects, lifestyle, and psychotic symptoms did not significantly affect this relationship. Antipsychotic-treated FEP patients who increased in HDL levels during the first year of follow-up exhibited better verbal learning capacity.

This meta-analysis quantifies the magnitude of this relationship and investigates the roles of sex, definition of caseness, different forms of addiction, the hand measured (right hand versus left hand), and other cohort characteristics. Univariate random-effects meta-analyses were performed, and moderators were tested with Bonferroni-corrected meta-regression analyses. The study included 18 independent samples with a total of 175,955 participants (96,316 males and 79,639 females). There was a significant difference in 2D:4D between the substance and computer-using subjects and the controls for the combined sample (Hedge's g = - 0.178 [- 0.291; - 0.064]) and for males (Hedge's g = - 0.260 [- 0.399; - 0.122]), but not for females. These effects were amplified when only analyzing studies that compared dependent versus non-dependent subjects (combined sample: g = - 0.325 [- 0.492; - 0.157]; males: g = - 0.427 [- 0.564; - 0.291]), but did not reach significance in the subgroup of studies examining other parameters of substance and computer use. When analyzing different forms of substance and computer use separately, alcohol intake and computer use revealed a significant difference in the standardized mean.

Carbon dots (CDs) were modified with glutaraldehyde for DNA conjugation, and antibody against 8-OHdG was immobilized on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The presence of DNA-8-OHdG can be linked to CDs by reaction of amino groups on DNA with glutaraldehyde. AuNPs were brought closely to CDs by specific immune reaction between 8-OHdG and antibody on AuNPs. Under 350 nm photoexcitation, the emission of CDs with a peak at 440 nm is quenched by the AuNPs and not restored. In the presence of DNA-8-OHdG, the measured fluorescence intensity decreases and quenching efficiency increases. The limit of detection is 700 pM, and the assay works in the 0.01 nM to 25 μM DNA-8-OHdG concentration range. The method is perceived to possess a good potential as a tool for detecting biomarkers for DNA damage due to oxidative stress.

In the event of the clinical suspicion of AAV the ANCA should first be determined by means of an antigen-specific immunoassay for proteinase 3‑ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA, according to current consensus recommendations. The diagnosis of AAV should also be confirmed by biopsy if possible. The classification criteria for AAV are currently being revised. Diagnostic criteria do not exist. The standard induction therapy consists of rituximab or cyclophosphamide, each in combination with glucocorticoids (GC). In the absence of severe organ involvement, methotrexate can alternatively be used. Recent study data suggest that additive plasmapheresis does not improve the long-term outcome. After remission, remission-preserving treatment with azathioprine, methotrexate or rituximab should be given for at least 48 months. The risk of severe infections is markedly increased, especially during the remission induction phase but can also be reduced during treatment with rituximab by the prophylactic administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Deaths were more common during the secretory phase (56.9%) in the suicidal group, while in the non-suicidal group, death occurred more commonly in the proliferative phase (66.3%). In reference to proliferative phase, deaths were more in the secretory phase and menstrual phase in the suicidal group, adjusted odd's ratio (OR) being 3.7 (p = 0.042) and 4.7 (p = 0.032), respectively.

Several studies have shown that perioperative body composition changes are affected by multimodal treatment for gastrointestinal cancer. This review summarizes the background, current status, and future perspectives of perioperative body composition changes in the multimodal treatment of gastrointestinal cancer. Recent studies have described the body composition changes observed in the early period after surgery and during adjuvant therapy. Changes in the body composition might affect adjuvant chemotherapy toxicity after surgery and postoperative complications after neoadjuvant therapy. The mechanisms underlying body composition changes during multimodal therapy are multifactorial and include systemic inflammation, reduced nutrient intake, and physical inactivity. Several approaches have been tested to maintain the body composition, and especially prevent skeletal muscle wasting, during multimodal therapy. Although the ideal approach for managing body composition changes in gastrointestinal cancer patients remains unclear, recent studies support the combination of multiple approaches rather than a single approach.",Mutations in CDKN2A and the FGFR3 genes on bladder cancer diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028457,World journal of urology,2019 04 27,To determine the association between mutations in CDKN2A and FGFR3 genes and the diagnosis of bladder carcinoma (BCa).,Pregnancy following urinary tract reconstruction using bowel segments: a review of published literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028456,World journal of urology,2019 04 27,To provide a literature review of the urological and obstetric outcomes during and after pregnancy following urinary diversion using bowel segments.,Urinary fungi associated with urinary symptom severity among women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028455,World journal of urology,2019 06 10,"To correlate the presence of fungi with symptom flares, pain and urinary severity in a prospective, longitudinal study of women with IC/BPS enrolled in the MAPP Research Network.","Cla4 PAK-like kinase is required for pathogenesis, asexual/sexual development and polarized growth in Bipolaris maydis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028454,Current genetics,2019 04 27,"PAK (p21-activated protein kinases)-like kinases are master regulators of development and morphogenesis, which were conserved among eukaryotes, including fungi.

In this study, to examine the broad functions of PAK-like kinases in growth, pathogenicity and asexual/sexual reproduction in filamentous fungi, we identified and characterized two PAK-like kinases, Ste20 and Cla4 in Bipolaris maydis. A single mutant of both Ste20 and Cla4 gene was viable, while the double mutant was not available, possibly because of lethality. In growth, conidiation, and pathogenicity, Δste20 strains showed phenotypes similar to those of the wild-type, while Δcla4 strains showed severely defected phenotypes. In this study, we also clarified that Ste20 is partially involved in pseudothecium development but is dispensable for maternity, while Cla4 is essential for maternal pseudothecium development and also involve in ascospore development in paternal pseudothecium. Fluorescent microscopy visualized the disorder in cell polarity at the hyphal tip in Δcla4. These results suggested that not Ste20 but Cla4 is a master regulator of growth, pathogenicity and asexual/sexual development in B. maydis.

Once cells initiate the meiotic divisions, it is imperative that they complete meiosis. Inappropriate exit from meiosis and entrance into mitosis can create polyploid cells and can lead to germline tumors. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells enter meiosis when starved of nutrients but can return to mitosis if provided nutrient-rich medium before a defined commitment point. Once past the meiotic commitment point in prometaphase I, cells stay committed to meiosis even in the presence of a mitosis-inducing signal. Recent research investigated the maintenance of meiotic commitment in budding yeast and found that two checkpoints that do not normally function in meiosis I, the DNA damage checkpoint and the spindle position checkpoint, have crucial functions in maintaining meiotic commitment.

Generally, the colonization of inoculated bacteria is considered to be the determining factor in technical success. However, increasing reports have shown that bioaugmentation was still effective when the colonization of inoculated bacteria was unsuccessful. Here, an augmentation study with iron-reducing bacteria (IRB, Shewanella decolorationis S12) was conducted in Fe(II)-poor sediments to elucidate the role of exogenously inoculated bacteria for bioaugmentation performance. The results showed that a sufficient amount of IRB inputs enhanced the iron reduction in bioaugmented sediments, even though the exogenous IRB did not colonize after the beginning of the experiment (less than 1% at day 3). The iron reduction function responded to stimulation of the indigenous IRB community such as Clostridium, Cupriavidus, Fervidicella, and Acinetobacter, which comprised less than 1% in the initial sediments. Moreover, compared with microbial community in control sediment, more positive correlations between OTUs were observed for that in S12-added sediments upon network analysis. The pH and oxidation-reduction potential of sediment were found to be the predominant factors shaping the iron-reducing microbial communities. It meant that exogenous IRB successfully trigged functional community via altering microenvironment by the inoculated bacteria.

Therefore, skin diseases are among the most common disorders. In many of them, the immune system plays a crucial pathogenetic role. For didactic and therapeutic reasons, classification of such immune-mediated skin diseases according to the underlying dominant immune mechanism rather than to their clinical manifestation appears to be reasonable. Immune-mediated skin diseases may be mediated mainly by T cells, by the humoral immune system, or by uncontrolled unspecific inflammation. According to the involved T cell subpopulation, T cell-mediated diseases may be further subdivided into T1 cell-dominated (e.g., vitiligo), T2 cell-dominated (e.g., acute atopic dermatitis), T17/T22 cell-dominated (e.g., psoriasis), and Treg cell-dominated (e.g., melanoma) responses. Moreover, T cell-dependent and -independent responses may occur simultaneously in selected diseases (e.g., hidradenitis suppurativa). The effector mechanisms of the respective T cell subpopulations determine the molecular changes in the local tissue cells, leading to specific microscopic and macroscopic skin alterations. In this article, we show how the increasing knowledge of the T cell biology has been comprehensively translated into the pathogenetic understanding of respective model skin diseases and, based thereon, has revolutionized their daily clinical management.",The hepatic capsular arteries: imaging features and clinical significance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028433,Abdominal radiology (New York),2019 04 27,"Although the anatomical features of the hepatic capsular arteries have been previously reported, the radiological and clinical importance of these arteries has not been well documented.",Diagnostic accuracy of acoustic radiation force impulse elastography (ARFI) in comparison to other non-invasive modalities in staging of liver fibrosis in chronic HCV patients: single-center experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028432,Abdominal radiology (New York),2019 04 27,To evaluate the reliability of ARFI elastography for liver fibrosis staging and compare it to other non-invasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis (FIB-4 and APRI) in chronic HCV (CHC) patients.,The role of the complement system in HIV infection and preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028431,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The food web of these ray species predominately consisted of zooplankton, three species of fish, and five species of invertebrates. Mean δ15N values in all species ranged from 10.54 ± 0.18‰ in zooplankton to 17.84 ± 0.81‰ in the shovelnose guitarfish.

The resemblance is advantageous for the mimic-species because the mimic-species can deceive predators and avoid predation. While Batesian mimicry is an important subject in ecology as a general phenomenon in nature, previous theoretical studies focus mainly on the evolution of mimicry and the predator learning process. In these mathematical models, the population sizes of the model- and mimic-species are not considered explicitly or are assumed to be constant, but this is not plausible in model-mimic community dynamics. Thus, the model-mimic community has been paid relatively less attention; However, to elucidate problems on Batesian mimicry, it is essential to understand the fundamental characteristics of the model-mimic community dynamics. Here, we construct a basic model-mimic community dynamics model, obtain the existence and stability conditions of its equilibria, and conduct the bifurcation analysis and numerical calculation. The results show that the instability of the model-only population is predicted, and this is consistent with the typical pattern of geographical distribution in Batesian mimicry in the field. We propose three new hypotheses to explain the typical pattern of geographical distribution. Furthermore, we reveal an irreversibility regarding the model-mimic coexistence that is important for the conservation of the model- and mimic-species.","Streptococcus gwangjuense sp. nov., Isolated from Human Pericoronitis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028412,Current microbiology,2019 06 10,"A novel facultative anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative coccus, designated strain ChDC B345T, was isolated from human pericoronitis lesion and was characterized by polyphasic taxonomic analysis.

SEC-ICP-MS in combination with a double isotope dilution approach enabled facile validation of the antibodies' integrity, the determination of the batch to batch labelling efficiency, monitoring of each labelling step, and quantification of the immunocomplexes after incubation with the target protein. The addition of oxygen into the dynamic reaction cell improved the detection of sulphur as a marker for the antibodies and target protein via mass-shifting (LOD = 3.7 ng/mL), whilst maintaining sufficient sensitivity for the analysis of the lanthanides. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) SEC ensured a rapid chromatographic method with separation times under 7 min of the labelled and unlabelled antibodies, the immunocomplexes, and the unconjugated polymer used to lanthanide-label the antibodies. SEC calibration estimated the molecular weights of all peaks and provided valuable insights in immunochemical reactions and the stoichiometry of the reactants and products. A novel on-line isotope dilution analysis (IDA) enabled absolute quantification of sulphur and lanthanide signals and the protein of interest. The chromatographic separation of immunocomplexes and labelled antibodies allowed the simultaneous determination of the antibody/metal stoichiometry and target protein concentration from a single mass flow chromatogram. An immunoglobulin protein was quantified after incubation with an 153Eu-labelled primary polyclonal antibody. The procedure was validated with direct labelling of the target protein with 156Gd for parallel, simultaneous quantification. The concentration determined via direct labelling of the protein deviated 1.9% from the immunochemical approach employing 153Eu-labelled polyclonal antibodies.

RCAos are associated with a high incidence of restenosis, and the implantations of drug-eluting stents for RCAos have not been fully elucidated. The study participants included 75 patients (72.3 ± 9.5 years, 72% men) who underwent PCI for RCAos at our institution between November 2001 and May 2017. The angle between the greater curvature of the aortic wall and the right coronary artery take-off in the diastolic and systolic phases in the left anterior oblique position view was investigated. Clinical outcome was defined as binary restenosis at follow-up coronary angiography. We also evaluated target lesion failure (TLF) defined as a composite of cardiac mortality, target vessel myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). The incidence of binary restenosis was 48.0% (n = 36) of the entire cohort. The incidence of TLF was 49.3% (n = 37) of the entire cohort, which was mainly driven by TLR (36.0%, n = 27). The area under the curve of the gap-angle ratio [(difference between the maximum and minimum angles)/(minimum angle); GAR] for binary restenosis was 0.73, and the cutoff value was 0.306 (sensitivity 67%, specificity 82%). The patients were divided into two groups: a low-GAR (< 0.306; n = 30) and high-GAR group (> 0.306; n = 45). Binary restenosis was more frequent in the high-GAR group than in the low-GAR group (76.7% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.007). The cumulative rate of TLF was significantly higher in the high-GAR group when compared with the low-GAR group (53.3% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.01), which was mainly driven by TLR (56.7% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.01).

Left atrial remodeling is associated with poor outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). This study aimed to investigate whether prolonged total atrial conduction time predicts poor prognosis in patients with HF. We performed transthoracic echocardiography in 100 patients (65 men; mean age 68 ± 13 years) who were hospitalized for HF. Total atrial conduction time was defined as the duration from P wave onset on electrocardiography to peak A' wave on tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography (PA-TDI duration). There were 37 cardiac events (37%) during a median follow-up period of 414 days. The PATDI duration was significantly longer in patients with cardiac events than in those without (150 ± 18 ms vs 133 ± 19 ms; P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions and ejection fractions between patients with and without cardiac events. Patients with HF were divided into 3 groups according to tertiles of the PA-TDI duration. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the highest tertile of PA-TDI duration was associated with the greatest risk among patients with HF. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the PA-TDI duration was an independent predictor of cardiac events, leading to the conclusion that prolonged PA-TDI duration was a feasible predictor of cardiac prognosis in patients with HF.",Pattern of failure in anaplastic glioma patients with an IDH1/2 mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028406,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

For this reason, we evaluated 12 field strains of Ae. aegypti from Punjab for resistance against deltamethrin, permethrin, and temephos along with underlying resistance mechanisms. For deltamethrin, high level of resistance was observed in Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Sheikhupura, Lahore, Pattoki, and Kasur strains (RRLC50 > 10-fold); moderate level of resistance in Sargodha, Gujranwala, and Sialkot strains (RRLC50 = 5- to 10-fold), and low level of resistance in Okara, Multan, and Sahiwal strains (RRLC50 < 5-fold). In the case of permethrin, high level of resistance was found in all the field strains, except the Okara strain that exhibited moderate resistance. For temephos, five field strains, viz. Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Kasur, Lahore, and Gujranwala, showed high level of resistance; five strains, viz.

Synergism bioassays implementing piperonyl butoxide and S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate exhibited a nonsignificant effect on synergizing toxicity of deltamethrin and permethrin in all field strains except the Lahore strain, suggesting the possible role of target-site resistance mechanism. However, both synergists had a significant effect on synergizing toxicity of temephos in all field strains, suggesting the possibility of metabolic-based mechanism of insecticide resistance. In conclusion, the study confirmed the presence of resistance to deltamethrin, permethrin, and temephos in the studied field strains of Ae. aegypti from Punjab, Pakistan.",Adaptation and Conservation throughout the Drosophila melanogaster Life-Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028390,Genome biology and evolution,2019 06 10,"Previous studies of the evolution of genes expressed at different life-cycle stages of Drosophila melanogaster have not been able to disentangle adaptive from nonadaptive substitutions when using nonsynonymous sites. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining whole-genome polymorphism data from D. melanogaster and divergence data between D. melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba. For the set of genes expressed at different life-cycle stages of D. melanogaster, as reported in modENCODE, we estimate the ratio of substitutions relative to polymorphism between nonsynonymous and synonymous sites (α) and then α is discomposed into the ratio of adaptive (ωa) and nonadaptive (ωna) substitutions to synonymous substitutions. We find that the genes expressed in mid- and late-embryonic development are the most conserved, whereas those expressed in early development and postembryonic stages are the least conserved. Importantly, we found that low conservation in early development is due to high rates of nonadaptive substitutions (high ωna), whereas in postembryonic stages it is due, instead, to high rates of adaptive substitutions (high ωa). By using estimates of different genomic features (codon bias, average intron length, exon number, recombination rate, among others), we also find that genes expressed in mid- and late-embryonic development show the most complex architecture: they are larger, have more exons, more transcripts, and longer introns. In addition, these genes are broadly expressed among all stages. We suggest that all these genomic features are related to the conservation of mid- and late-embryonic development. Globally, our study supports the hourglass pattern of conservation and adaptation over the life-cycle.",Genomic Plasticity Mediated by Transposable Elements in the Plant Pathogenic Fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028389,Genome biology and evolution,2019 06 10,"Phytopathogen genomes are under constant pressure to change, as pathogens are locked in an evolutionary arms race with their hosts, where pathogens evolve effector genes to manipulate their hosts, whereas the hosts evolve immune components to recognize the products of these genes. Colletotrichum higginsianum (Ch), a fungal pathogen with no known sexual morph, infects Brassicaceae plants including Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies revealed that Ch differs in its virulence toward various Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, indicating the existence of coevolutionary selective pressures. However, between-strain genomic variations in Ch have not been studied. Here, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Ch strain, resulting in a highly contiguous genome assembly, which was compared with the chromosome-level genome assembly of another strain to identify genomic variations between strains. We found that the two closely related strains vary in terms of large-scale rearrangements, the existence of strain-specific regions, and effector candidate gene sets and that these variations are frequently associated with transposable elements (TEs). Ch has a compartmentalized genome consisting of gene-sparse, TE-dense regions with more effector candidate genes and gene-dense, TE-sparse regions harboring conserved genes. Additionally, analysis of the conservation patterns and syntenic regions of effector candidate genes indicated that the two strains vary in their effector candidate gene sets because of de novo evolution, horizontal gene transfer, or gene loss after divergence. Our results reveal mechanisms for generating genomic diversity in this asexual pathogen, which are important for understanding its adaption to hosts.",desynaptic5 carries a spontaneous semi-dominant mutation affecting Disrupted Meiotic cDNA 1 in barley.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028386,Journal of experimental botany,2019 05 16,"Despite conservation of the process of meiosis, recombination landscapes vary between species, with large genome grasses such as barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) exhibiting a pattern of recombination that is very heavily skewed to the ends of chromosomes. We have been using a collection of semi-sterile desynaptic meiotic mutant lines to help elucidate how recombination is controlled in barley and the role of the corresponding wild-type (WT) meiotic genes within this process. Here we applied a combination of genetic segregation analysis, cytogenetics, and immunocytology to genetically map and characterize the meiotic mutant desynaptic5 (des5). We identified an exonic insertion in the positional candidate ortholog of Disrupted Meiotic cDNA 1 (HvDMC1) on chromosome 5H of des5. des5 exhibits a severe meiotic phenotype with disturbed synapsis, reduced crossovers, and chromosome mis-segregation. The meiotic phenotype and reduced fertility of des5 is similarly observed in Hvdmc1RNAi transgenic plants and HvDMC1p:GusPlus reporter lines show DMC1 expression specifically in the developing inflorescence.

Biochemical and genetic studies indicate accessory helicases play essential roles in replication in the presence of nucleoprotein barriers, but how they operate inside the cell is unclear. With high-speed single-molecule microscopy we observed genomically-encoded fluorescent constructs of the accessory helicase Rep and core replisome protein DnaQ in live Escherichia coli cells. We demonstrate that Rep colocalizes with 70% of replication forks, with a hexameric stoichiometry, indicating maximal occupancy of the single DnaB hexamer. Rep associates dynamically with the replisome with an average dwell time of 6.5 ms dependent on ATP hydrolysis, indicating rapid binding then translocation away from the fork. We also imaged PriC replication restart factor and observe Rep-replisome association is also dependent on PriC. Our findings suggest two Rep-replisome populations in vivo: one continually associating with DnaB then translocating away to aid nucleoprotein barrier removal ahead of the fork, another assisting PriC-dependent reloading of DnaB if replisome progression fails. These findings reveal how a single helicase at the replisome provides two independent ways of underpinning replication of protein-bound DNA, a problem all organisms face as they replicate their genomes.","Chronic kidney disease, heart failure and neprilysin inhibition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028383,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2019 04 27,"Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and this often manifests clinically like heart failure. Conversely, patients with heart failure frequently have reduced kidney function. The links between the kidneys and cardiovascular system are being elucidated, with blood pressure being a key risk factor. Patients with heart failure have benefitted from many trials which have now established a strong evidence based on which to base management. However, patients with advanced kidney disease have often been excluded from these trials. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that the benefits of such treatments are modified by the presence or absence of kidney disease, but more direct evidence among patients with advanced kidney disease is required. Neprilysin inhibition is the most recent treatment to be shown to improve outcomes among patients with heart failure. The UK HARP-III trial assessed whether neprilysin inhibition improved kidney function in the short- to medium-term and its effects on cardiovascular biomarkers. Although no effect (compared to irbesartan control) was found on kidney function, allocation to neprilysin inhibition (sacubitril/valsartan) did reduce cardiac biomarkers more than irbesartan, suggesting that this treatment might improve cardiovascular outcomes in this population.

Sessile serrated polyps with dysplasia represent the most clinically significant serrated polyp; however, the morphologic heterogeneity of dysplasia in sessile serrated polyps has only recently been recognized and correlated with MLH1 immunohistochemistry. Detailed morphologic analysis of traditional serrated adenomas has led to the recognition of flat and early forms of this polyp. Robust data on the risk of metachronous lesions in patients with serrated polyps are also beginning to emerge. This review will summarize our current understanding of serrated polyps and associated carcinomas with a focus on diagnostic criteria, morphologic heterogeneity, molecular findings, and natural history.

Many adenoid cystic carcinomas have been reported to have a specific chromosome translocation t(6;9)/MYB-NFIB. More recently, t(8;9)/MYBL1-NFIB gene fusion was reported in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas which lacked a t(6;9)/MYB-NFIB. Two prior studies showed t(6;9)/MYB-NFIB in tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma; however, only rare cases of MYBL1 rearrangement have been reported in this carcinoma. In this study, we used targeted RNA sequencing to investigate fusion genes in tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma at our institution. Fusions of either MYB or MYBL1 genes were detected in 7 of 7 carcinomas. Three cases had MYB-NFIB, and 3 had MYBL1-NFIB. The remaining case showed a rare MYBL1-RAD51B fusion. These findings suggest that rearrangement involving MYB or MYBL1 is a hallmark of tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma.",Precision genotyping diagnosis of lung tumors with trophoblastic morphology in young women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028360,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2019 04 27,"Trophoblastic differentiation has been previously described in somatic carcinomas at different primary sites, including the lung. Lung carcinomas with trophoblastic morphology presenting in women during the reproductive years pose a unique diagnostic challenge due to their overlapping microscopical and immunophenotypical features with metastatic choriocarcinoma of gestational origin. Distinction between the two entities is paramount as they require different chemotherapeutic regimens and have a markedly different prognostic outlook. Here we report a series of three female patients (ages 37-48 years) presenting with lung masses. Two of the three patients were noted to have elevated serum beta-hCG levels at the time of their presentation, while serum beta-hCG was not evaluated preoperatively in the third patient. None of them had a clinical history of molar pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Core biopsies of the lung masses were performed in two patients and one patient underwent a wedge resection, showing poorly differentiated carcinoma in all cases with scattered multinucleated giant cells, hemorrhage, and necrosis. Beta-hCG immunostain was performed in two cases and showed diffuse immunoreactivity. Clinical history and imaging studies were not conclusive in any of the cases to rule out a gestational origin. Short tandem repeat genotyping analysis was performed to compare the allelic patterns between tumor and normal tissues and revealed identical profiles in one case, consistent with somatic origin, and unique paternal alleles in two cases, confirming metastatic gestational choriocarcinoma. The patient with primary somatic lung carcinoma died of disease within 15 months despite chemotherapy, while both patients with gestational choriocarcinoma responded well to chemotherapy and are alive without evidence of disease. Our cases illustrate the diagnostic pitfalls of lung tumors with trophoblastic differentiation in young women. Genotyping analysis offers precise diagnostic distinction between primary lung carcinoma and gestational choriocarcinoma with major therapeutic and prognostic implications for the patients.",Molecular mechanisms of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028357,Nature reviews. Cardiology,2019 05 01,"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder characterized by the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction and fibrofatty replacement of myocardial tissue. Mutations in genes that encode components of desmosomes, the adhesive junctions that connect cardiomyocytes, are the predominant cause of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and can be identified in about half of patients with the condition. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to myocardial destruction, remodelling and arrhythmic predisposition remain poorly understood. Through the development of animal, induced pluripotent stem cell and other models of disease, advances in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy over the past decade have brought several signalling pathways into focus. These pathways include canonical and non-canonical WNT signalling, the Hippo-Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway and transforming growth factor-β signalling. These studies have begun to identify potential therapeutic targets whose modulation has shown promise in preclinical models.

MICs values ranged between 1 to 4 mg and 0.5 to 256 mg l-1 for eravacycline and colistin, respectively. In vitro synergy between eravacycline and colistin was evaluated by using the chequerboard methodology. Synergistic activity was found in 10% of the strains, and additive effect in 30%. No antagonism was detected. Similar activity was also observed in colistin-resistant CRAB isolates. The result of this study indicates that eravacycline and colistin combination may be a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of CRAB related infections.","Synergistic combinations of anthelmintic salicylanilides oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, and closantel with colistin eradicates multidrug-resistant colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028351,The Journal of antibiotics,2019 04 27,"Repurposing nonantibiotic drugs for antimicrobial therapy presents a viable approach to drug discovery. Development of therapeutic strategies that overcome existing resistance mechanisms is important especially against those bacterial infections in which treatment options are limited, such as against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

As a stand-alone agent, the three salicylanilides suffered from limited outer membrane permeation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with oxyclozanide also susceptible to efflux. Synergy was apparent for the combinations against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Susceptibility breakpoints for colistin, but also with polymyxin B, were reached upon addition of 1 µg ml-1 of the corresponding salicylanilide against colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Furthermore, enhanced bacterial killing was observed in all combinations. Our data corroborate the repositioning of the three salicylanilides as adjuvants to counter resistance to the antibiotic of last resort colistin.

Gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 04 28,"Caloric excess and sedentary lifestyle have led to a global epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The hepatic consequence of metabolic syndrome and obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is estimated to affect up to one-third of the adult population in many developed and developing countries. This spectrum of liver disease ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Owing to the high prevalence of NAFLD, especially in industrialized countries but also worldwide, and the consequent burden of progressive liver disease, there is mounting epidemiological evidence that NAFLD has rapidly become a leading aetiology underlying many cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this Review, we discuss NAFLD-associated HCC, including its epidemiology, the key features of the hepatic NAFLD microenvironment (for instance, adaptive and innate immune responses) that promote hepatocarcinogenesis and the management of HCC in patients with obesity and associated metabolic comorbidities.

In this study we investigated the effects of CUR on fear extinction and related depression-like behaviors in mice. In fear conditioning task, we found that administration of CUR (1.6, 8, 40 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip, for 7 days) did not affect memory consolidation, but CUR at higher doses (8, 40 mg·kg-1·d-1) significantly facilitated fear extinction, especially on D3 and D4. Moreover, CUR administration significantly ameliorated the fear conditioning-induced depression-like behaviors, likely through promoting fear extinction. We showed that CUR increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus, and activated protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Administration of the selective TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF, 5 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) also facilitated fear extinction, ameliorated depression-like behaviors. We established a mouse learned helplessness (LH) model to evaluate the antidepressant activity of CUR. The spatial memory was assessed in Morris water maze. We showed that LH-induced depression-like behaviors, including prolonged immobility times in forced swim and tail suspension tests as well as spatial memory impairments; LH also downregulated BDNF expression and the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus. Administration of CUR (1.6, 8, 40 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip, for 14 days) or 7,8-DHF (5 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip, for 3 days) prevented LH-induced depression-like behaviors and promoted BDNF expression and the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, CUR can accelerate the fear memory extinction and ameliorate depression-like behaviors in mice via promoting BDNF expression and activating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus.","Bufalin suppresses the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through HOTAIR, the sponge of miR-520b.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028291,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2019 04 27,"Bufalin, the major active component of the traditional Chinese medicine ChanSu obtained from the skin and parotid venom glands of toads, has long been known as an anticancer agent. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the anticancer activities of bufalin, while long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to interact with miRNAs to regulate various biological functions. In this paper, we investigated the possible network related to the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We demonstrated that bufalin (0.05-10 µM) dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells with IC50 values of 0.89 and 1.28 µM, respectively. Furthermore, bufalin treatment significantly suppressed the cell migration and invasion. To explore the role of lncRNAs in the antimetastatic activity of bufalin, we used an lncRNA microarray and found that HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was the most markedly downregulated lncRNA in bufalin-treated PCa cells. Overexpression of HOTAIR counteracted the suppressing effects of bufalin on DU145 and PC3 cells. We then predicted and verified that HOTAIR upregulated FGFR1 expression by sponging miR-520b in PCa cells. In 40 patients with PCa bone metastasis, we used in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical assay to assess the HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression, which revealed that both HOTAIR and FGFR1 expression were significantly higher in bone metastasis tissues than in the primary PCa tissues. In addition, the level of serum HOTAIR was positively associated with the levels of serum bone metabolic markers (CTx, OST, B-ALP and PINP) and may serve as a reasonable biomarker for PCa bone metastasis. Taken together, this is the first study revealing that HOTAIR promotes PCa bone metastasis, and bufalin may be a promising candidate for the treatment of this disease.","Large-scale analyses of the relationship between sex, age and intelligence quotient heterogeneity and cortical morphometry in autism spectrum disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028290,Molecular psychiatry,2019 04 27,"Significant heterogeneity across aetiologies, neurobiology and clinical phenotypes have been observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neuroimaging-based neuroanatomical studies of ASD have often reported inconsistent findings which may, in part, be attributable to an insufficient understanding of the relationship between factors influencing clinical heterogeneity and their relationship to brain anatomy. To this end, we performed a large-scale examination of cortical morphometry in ASD, with a specific focus on the impact of three potential sources of heterogeneity: sex, age and full-scale intelligence (FIQ). To examine these potentially subtle relationships, we amassed a large multi-site dataset that was carefully quality controlled (yielding a final sample of 1327 from the initial dataset of 3145 magnetic resonance images; 491 individuals with ASD). Using a meta-analytic technique to account for inter-site differences, we identified greater cortical thickness in individuals with ASD relative to controls, in regions previously implicated in ASD, including the superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal sulcus. Greater cortical thickness was observed in sex specific regions; further, cortical thickness differences were observed to be greater in younger individuals and in those with lower FIQ, and to be related to overall clinical severity. This work serves as an important step towards parsing factors that influence neuroanatomical heterogeneity in ASD and is a potential step towards establishing individual-specific biomarkers.",Use of polymeric CXCR4 inhibitors as siRNA delivery vehicles for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028289,Cancer gene therapy,2019 04 27,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and is associated with poor long-term survival often owing to relapse. Current treatments for AML are associated with considerable toxicity and are frequently not effective after relapse. Thus, it is important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapeutics targeting key oncogenes have been proposed as treatments for AML. We recently developed novel siRNA delivery polycations (PCX) based on AMD3100 (plerixafor), an FDA-approved inhibitor of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Inhibitors of CXCR4 have been shown to sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, PCX has the potential to target leukemia cells via two mechanisms: inhibition of CXCR4 and delivery of siRNAs against critical genes. In this report, we show that PCX exerts a cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells more effectively than other CXCR4 inhibitors, including AMD3100. In addition, we show that PCX can deliver siRNAs against the transcription factor RUNX1 to mouse and human leukemia cells. Overall, our study provides the first evidence that dual-function PCX/siRNA nanoparticles can simultaneously inhibit CXCR4 and deliver siRNAs, targeting key oncogenes in leukemia cells and that PCX/siRNA has clinical potential for the treatment of AML.",Visual performance of an extended depth of focus intraocular lens for treatment selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028286,"Eye (London, England)",2019 04 28,To evaluate the visual performance of an extended depth of focus (EDOF) intraocular lens (IOL) for patient selection.,Positive ecological effects of wind farms on vegetation in China's Gobi desert.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028283,Scientific reports,2019 05 08,"With the rapid development of wind power, there are increasing concerns about the negative ecological effects of its construction and operation. However, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of wind farms on flying fauna (i.e., birds and bats) or climate change separately from communities or ecosystems, and little attention has been paid to vegetation during wind farm operation. Furthermore, few studies have referred to vulnerable ecosystems with low biomass and biodiversity. In this research, a field study was conducted to investigate the effects of wind farms on the individual traits, community structures and ecosystem functions of Gobi Desert ecosystems. The effects were measured by comparing interfering areas (IAs, located between 40 m and 90 m in the downstream direction of the wind turbine) with non-interfering areas (NIAs, located over 200 m from the wind turbine matrixes). The results showed that (1) plant individuals in IAs were less stressed and in better physiological states than those in NIAs; (2) for community structures, IA plants tended to be shorter and denser and had a higher coverage condition than that of NIA plants; and (3) ecosystem functions in IAs were significantly improved due to the existence of shrubs and higher biomass. Meanwhile, significant correlations were identified between the wind wake caused by the large spinning blades and the community structures. Constructing wind turbines in the Gobi Desert is a win-win strategy that both contributes to the growth of desert vegetation with a favourable microclimate and sufficiently utilizes wind power to produce clean energy.",Pathway analysis of a genome-wide gene by air pollution interaction study in asthmatic children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028280,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 04 28,"We aimed to investigate the role of genetics in the respiratory response of asthmatic children to air pollution, with a genome-wide level analysis of gene by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) interaction on lung function and to identify biological pathways involved.",Mesenchyme-specific deletion of Tgf-β1 in the embryonic lung disrupts branching morphogenesis and induces lung hypoplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028279,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 04 27,"Proper lung development depends on the precise temporal and spatial expression of several morphogenic factors, including Fgf10, Fgf9, Shh, Bmp4, and Tgf-β. Over- or under-expression of these molecules often leads to aberrant embryonic or postnatal lung development. Herein, we deleted the Tgf-β1 gene specifically within the lung embryonic mesenchymal compartment at specific gestational stages to determine the contribution of this cytokine to lung development. Mutant embryos developed severe lung hypoplasia and died at birth due to the inability to breathe. Despite the markedly reduced lung size, proliferation and differentiation of the lung epithelium was not affected by the lack of mesenchymal expression of the Tgf-β1 gene, while apoptosis was significantly increased in the mutant lung parenchyma. Lack of mesenchymal expression of the Tgf-β1 gene was also associated with reduced lung branching morphogenesis, with accompanying inhibition of the local FGF10 signaling pathway as well as abnormal development of the vascular system. To shed light on the mechanism of lung hypoplasia, we quantified the phosphorylation of 226 proteins in the mutant E12.5 lung compared with control. We identified five proteins, Hrs, Vav2, c-Kit, the regulatory subunit of Pi3k (P85), and Fgfr1, that were over- or under-phosphorylated in the mutant lung, suggesting that they could be indispensable effectors of the TGF-β signaling program during embryonic lung development. In conclusion, we have uncovered novel roles of the mesenchyme-specific Tgf-β1 ligand in embryonic mouse lung development and generated a mouse model that may prove helpful to identify some of the key pathogenic mechanisms underlying lung hypoplasia in humans.",CXCR5+CD8+ T cells are a distinct functional subset with an antitumor activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028278,Leukemia,2019 04 30,"CXCR5 mediates homing of both B and follicular helper T (TFH) cells into follicles of secondary lymphoid organs. We found that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells are present in human tonsils and follicular lymphoma, inhibit TFH-mediated B cell differentiation, and exhibit strong cytotoxic activity. Consistent with these findings, adoptive transfer of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells into an animal model of lymphoma resulted in significantly greater antitumor activity than CXCR5-CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, RNA-Seq-based transcriptional profiling revealed 77 differentially expressed genes unique to CXCR5+CD8+ T cells. Among these, a signature comprised of 33 upregulated genes correlated with improved survival in follicular lymphoma patients. We also showed that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells could be induced and expanded ex vivo using IL-23 plus TGF-β, suggesting a possible strategy to generate these cells for clinical application. In summary, our study identified CXCR5+CD8+ T cells as a distinct T cell subset with ability to suppress TFH-mediated B cell differentiation, exert strong antitumor activity, and confer favorable prognosis in follicular lymphoma patients."

Yet, human pathophysiological valvulogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we report that, by combining single cell sequencing and in vivo approaches, a population of human pre-valvular endocardial cells (HPVCs) can be derived from pluripotent stem cells. HPVCs express gene patterns conforming to the E9.0 mouse atrio-ventricular canal (AVC) endocardium signature. HPVCs treated with BMP2, cultured on mouse AVC cushions, or transplanted into the AVC of embryonic mouse hearts, undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and express markers of valve interstitial cells of different valvular layers, demonstrating cell specificity. Extending this model to patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells recapitulates features of mitral valve prolapse and identified dysregulation of the SHH pathway.

It functions as a positive regulator of GPC and has a pleiotropic effect on rice grain quality. One SNP located in OsGluA2 promoter region is associated with its transcript expression level and GPC diversity. Polymorphisms of this nucleotide can divide all haplotypes into low (OsGluA2LET) and high (OsGluA2HET) expression types. Population genetic and evolutionary analyses reveal that OsGluA2LET, mainly present in japonica accessions, originates from wild rice. However, OsGluA2HET, the dominant type in indica, is acquired through mutation of OsGluA2LET. Our results shed light on the understanding of natural variations of GPC between indica and japonica subspecies.",Differential human antibody repertoires following Zika infection and the implications for serodiagnostics and disease outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028263,Nature communications,2019 05 13,"Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Americas led to extensive efforts to develop vaccines and ZIKV-specific diagnostics. In the current study, we use whole genome phage display library spanning the entire ZIKV genome (ZIKV-GFPDL) for in-depth immune profiling of IgG and IgM antibody repertoires in serum and urine longitudinal samples from individuals acutely infected with ZIKV. We observe a very diverse IgM immune repertoire encompassing the entire ZIKV polyprotein on day 0 in both serum and urine. ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies increase 10-fold between day 0 and day 7 in serum, but not in urine; these are highly focused on prM/E, NS1 and NS2B. Differential antibody affinity maturation is observed against ZIKV structural E protein compared with nonstructural protein NS1. Serum antibody affinity to ZIKV-E protein inversely correlates with ZIKV disease symptoms. Our study provides insight into unlinked evolution of immune response to ZIKV infection and identified unique targets for ZIKV serodiagnostics.",High-resolution specificity profiling and off-target prediction for site-specific DNA recombinases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028261,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"The development of site-specific recombinases (SSRs) as genome editing agents is limited by the difficulty of altering their native DNA specificities. Here we describe Rec-seq, a method for revealing the DNA specificity determinants and potential off-target substrates of SSRs in a comprehensive and unbiased manner. We applied Rec-seq to characterize the DNA specificity determinants of several natural and evolved SSRs including Cre, evolved variants of Cre, and other SSR family members. Rec-seq profiling of these enzymes and mutants thereof revealed previously uncharacterized SSR interactions, including specificity determinants not evident from SSR:DNA structures. Finally, we used Rec-seq specificity profiles to predict off-target substrates of Tre and Brec1 recombinases, including endogenous human genomic sequences, and confirmed their ability to recombine these off-target sequences in human cells. These findings establish Rec-seq as a high-resolution method for rapidly characterizing the DNA specificity of recombinases with single-nucleotide resolution, and for informing their further development.",High-fidelity spin and optical control of single silicon-vacancy centres in silicon carbide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028260,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Scalable quantum networking requires quantum systems with quantum processing capabilities. Solid state spin systems with reliable spin-optical interfaces are a leading hardware in this regard. However, available systems suffer from large electron-phonon interaction or fast spin dephasing. Here, we demonstrate that the negatively charged silicon-vacancy centre in silicon carbide is immune to both drawbacks. Thanks to its 4A2 symmetry in ground and excited states, optical resonances are stable with near-Fourier-transform-limited linewidths, allowing exploitation of the spin selectivity of the optical transitions. In combination with millisecond-long spin coherence times originating from the high-purity crystal, we demonstrate high-fidelity optical initialization and coherent spin control, which we exploit to show coherent coupling to single nuclear spins with ∼1 kHz resolution. The summary of our findings makes this defect a prime candidate for realising memory-assisted quantum network applications using semiconductor-based spin-to-photon interfaces and coherently coupled nuclear spins.","Harmonising topographic & remotely sensed datasets, a reference dataset for shoreline and beach change analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028259,Scientific data,2019 05 14,"This paper presents a novel reference dataset for North Norfolk, UK, that demonstrates the value of harmonising coastal field-based topographic and remotely sensed datasets at local scales. It is hoped that this reference dataset and the associated methodologies will facilitate the use of topographic and remotely sensed coastal datasets, as demonstrated here using open-access UK Environment Agency datasets. Two core methodologies, used to generate the novel reference dataset, are presented. Firstly, we establish a robust approach to extracting shorelines from vertical aerial photography, validated against LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and coastal topography surveys. Secondly, we present a standard methodology for quantifying sediment volume change from spatially continuous LiDAR elevation datasets. As coastal systems are monitored at greater spatial resolution and temporal frequency there is an unprecedented opportunity to determine how and why coastal systems have changed in the past with a view to informing future forecasting. With revelation of trends that suggest increasing coastal risk, coastal change research is needed to inform the management and protection of coasts.",Water quality improvements offset the climatic debt for stream macroinvertebrates over twenty years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028258,Nature communications,2019 05 13,"Many species are accumulating climatic debt as they fail to keep pace with increasing global temperatures. In theory, concomitant decreases in other stressors (e.g. pollution, fragmentation) could offset some warming effects, paying climatic debt with accrued environmental credit. This process may be occurring in many western European rivers. We fit a Markov chain model to ~20,000 macroinvertebrate samples from England and Wales, and demonstrate that despite large temperature increases 1991-2011, macroinvertebrate communities remained close to their predicted equilibrium with environmental conditions. Using a novel analysis of multiple stressors, an accumulated climatic debt of 0.64 (±0.13 standard error) °C of warming was paid by a water-quality credit equivalent to 0.89 (±0.04)°C of cooling. Although there is finite scope for mitigating additional climate warming in this way, water quality improvements appear to have offset recent temperature increases, and the concept of environmental credit may be a useful tool for communicating climate offsetting.",Laguerre-Gaussian mode sorter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028257,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Exploiting a particular wave property for a particular application necessitates components capable of discriminating in the basis of that property. While spectral or polarisation decomposition can be straightforward, spatial decomposition is inherently more difficult and few options exist regardless of wave type. Fourier decomposition by a lens is a rare simple example of a spatial decomposition of great practical importance and practical simplicity; a two-dimensional decomposition of a beam into its linear momentum components. Yet this is often not the most appropriate spatial basis. Previously, no device existed capable of a two-dimensional decomposition into orbital angular momentum components, or indeed any discrete basis, despite it being a fundamental property in many wave phenomena. We demonstrate an optical device capable of decomposing a beam into a Cartesian grid of identical Gaussian spots each containing a single Laguerre-Gaussian component, using just a spatial light modulator and mirror.",Coupling carbon and energy fluxes in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028256,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"The major biogeochemical cycles of marine ecosystems are driven by solar energy. Energy that is initially captured through photosynthesis is transformed and transported to great ocean depths via complex, yet poorly understood, energy flow networks. Herein we show that the chemical composition and specific energy (Joules per unit mass or organic carbon) of sinking particulate matter collected in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre reveal dramatic changes in the upper 500 m of the water column as particles sink and age. In contrast to these upper water column processes, particles reaching the deep sea (4000 m) are energy-replete with organic carbon-specific energy values similar to surface phytoplankton. These enigmatic results suggest that the particles collected in the abyssal zone must be transported by rapid sinking processes. These fast-sinking particles control the pace of deep-sea benthic communities that live a feast-or-famine existence in an otherwise energy-depleted habitat.",Binless normalization of Hi-C data provides significant interaction and difference detection independent of resolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028255,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Chromosome conformation capture techniques, such as Hi-C, are fundamental in characterizing genome organization. These methods have revealed several genomic features, such as chromatin loops, whose disruption can have dramatic effects in gene regulation. Unfortunately, their detection is difficult; current methods require that the users choose the resolution of interaction maps based on dataset quality and sequencing depth. Here, we introduce Binless, a resolution-agnostic method that adapts to the quality and quantity of available data, to detect both interactions and differences. Binless relies on an alternate representation of Hi-C data, which leads to a more detailed classification of paired-end reads. Using a large-scale benchmark, we demonstrate that Binless is able to call interactions with higher reproducibility than other existing methods. Binless, which is freely available, can thus reliably be used to identify chromatin loops as well as for differential analysis of chromatin interaction maps."

The hippocampus is a complex brain structure involved in learning, memory and emotional responses, and its functioning is also affected in various disorders. Despite conserved intrinsic circuitry, behavioral and anatomical studies suggest the existence of a structural and functional gradient along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. Here, we used an unbiased mass spectrometry approach to characterize the lipid composition of distinct hippocampal subregions. In addition, we evaluated the susceptibility of each area to lipid modulation by corticosterone (CORT), an important mediator of the effects of stress. We confirmed a great similarity between hippocampal subregions relatively to other brain areas. Moreover, we observed a continuous molecular gradient along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, with the dorsal and ventral extremities differing significantly from each other, particularly in the relative abundance of sphingolipids and phospholipids. Also, whereas chronic CORT exposure led to remodeling of triacylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol species in both hippocampal poles, our study suggests that the ventral hippocampus is more sensitive to CORT-induced changes, with regional modulation of ceramide, dihydrosphingomyelin and phosphatidic acid. Thus, our results confirm a multipartite molecular view of dorsal-ventral hippocampal axis and emphasize lipid metabolites as candidate effectors of glucocorticoid signaling, mediating regional susceptibility to neurological disorders associated with stress.","Chronic stress triggers divergent dendritic alterations in immature neurons of the adult hippocampus, depending on their ultimate terminal fields.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028242,Translational psychiatry,2019 05 02,"Chronic stress, a suggested precipitant of brain pathologies, such as depression and Alzheimer's disease, is known to impact on brain plasticity by causing neuronal remodeling as well as neurogenesis suppression in the adult hippocampus. Although many studies show that stressful conditions reduce the number of newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), little is known about whether and how stress impacts on dendritic development and structural maturation of these newborn neurons. We, herein, demonstrate that chronic stress impacts differentially on doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons in distinct phases of maturation. Specifically, the density of the DCX-positive immature neurons whose dendritic tree reaches the inner molecular layer (IML) of DG is reduced in stressed animals, whereas their dendritic complexity is increased. On the contrary, no change on the density of DCX-positive neurons whose dendritic tree extends to the medial/outer molecular layer (M/OML) of the DG is found under stress conditions, whereas the dendritic complexity of these cells is diminished. In addition, DCX+ cells displayed a more complex and longer arbor in the dendritic compartments located in the granular cell layer of the DG under stress conditions; on the contrary, their dendritic segments localized into the M/OML were shorter and less complex. These findings suggest that the neuroplastic effects of chronic stress on dendritic maturation and complexity of DCX+ immature neurons vary based on the different maturation stage of DCX-positive cells and the different DG sublayer, highlighting the complex and dynamic stress-driven neuroplasticity of immature neurons in the adult hippocampus.",Effects of Sevoflurane Pretreatment on Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Through the Akt/Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α)/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028241,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 10,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sevoflurane (SEV) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and its mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Sham group (n=20), I/R group (n=20) and I/R+SEV group (n=20). The I/R model was established by ligating and recanalizing the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test and echocardiography (ECG) were used for analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied to detect the morphological changes. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was conducted to detect the apoptosis levels. The expression level of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) was measured. Finally, the effect of SEV on the protein kinase B (Akt)/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway was detected via western blotting. RESULTS SEV could significantly improve I/R-induced cardiac insufficiency, inhibit cardiac infarction, and as well as reduce the infarction area from 53.21±2.11% to 32.33±3.49% (P<0.05). Compared with rats in I/R group, the cardiac myofilament was better in alignment, degradation and necrosis were milder, and cell edema was notably reduced in the I/R+SEV group. Thus, SEV could significantly reverse the decreased expression of SOD2 caused by I/R and reduce oxidative stress in the heart (P<0.05). According to the western blotting results, SEV was capable of obviously activating the expressions of phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt), HIF-1alpha, and VEGF. CONCLUSIONS SEV can significantly improve myocardial injury caused by I/R in rats, and its mechanism might be related to the activation of the Akt/HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling pathway.",A Case of Myocardial Ischemia Detected by Global Longitudinal Strain Using Intraoperative Speckle-Tracking Echocardiography in a High-Risk Patient Undergoing Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028240,The American journal of case reports,2019 04 27,"BACKGROUND Global longitudinal strain (GLS) detected by echocardiography has been shown to have a prognostic role in the evaluation of myocardial ischemia in several clinical settings. A case is presented where GLS was used to detect intraoperative myocardial ischemia in a high-risk patient undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. CASE REPORT A 75-year-old Caucasian man with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a 60 pack-year smoking history presented with a one-week history of exertional chest pain. Two-dimensional (2D) speckle-tracking echocardiography was used to calculate myocardial velocities and deformation parameters, including GLS. A reduced baseline GLS of -18.2% was found with dysfunction of the basal anterior, inferior, and mid anterolateral wall of the left ventricle. During aortic cross-clamping, his basal segments became mildly hypokinetic, although his ejection fraction (EF) remained unchanged at 50-55%. Despite normal left ventricular systolic function on visual assessment, his GLS decreased to -14.2% during aortic cross-clamping with similar segmental changes noted in the baseline GLS analysis. After the release of the aortic cross-clamp, his basal segments returned to normal and his left ventricular systolic function improved with an EF of 60-65% and the GLS recovered to -18.4% with improvement in the basal segmental function. CONCLUSIONS This case report showed that detection of GLS by echocardiography was a sensitive indicator of myocardial dysfunction that was superior to regional ventricular wall assessment. Detection of early changes in myocardial function by evaluating GLS may assist in guiding anesthetic management in high-risk patients with ischemic heart disease.",Lung function in children with sickle cell disease from Central Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028238,Thorax,2019 05 16,"Lung function in patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) living in sub-Saharan Africa is largely unknown.

By examining mouse livers, we have found that in the fasted state, the Mediator complex exists primarily as an approximately 1.2-MDa complex, consistent with the size of the large Mediator complex, whereas following feeding, it converts to an approximately 600-kDa complex, consistent with the size of the core Mediator complex. This dynamic change is due to the dissociation and degradation of the kinase module that includes the MED13, MED12, cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), and cyclin C (CCNC) subunits. The dissociation and degradation of the kinase module are dependent upon nutrient activation of mTORC1 that is necessary for the induction of lipogenic gene expression because pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mTORC1 in the fed state restores the kinase module. The degradation but not dissociation of the kinase module depends upon the E3 ligase, SCFFBW7 In addition, genetically insulin-resistant and obese db/db mice in the fasted state displayed elevated lipogenic gene expression and loss of the kinase module that was reversed following mTORC1 inhibition. These data demonstrate that the assembly state of the Mediator complex undergoes physiologic regulation during normal cycles of fasting and feeding in the mouse liver. Furthermore, the assembly state of the Mediator complex is dysregulated in states of obesity and insulin resistance.","Current barriers, facilitators and future improvements to advance quality of abortion care: views of women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028169,BMJ sexual & reproductive health,2019 04 27,"Barriers to accessing abortion care continue to exist even in settings where abortion is legal.

Methods: We included patients with a clinical diagnosis for AD (n = 13) or FTD (n = 12), respectively, who were examined with 18F-FDG PET/CTs after injection of 210 ± 9 MBq 18F-FDG. List mode data was reconstructed over various time intervals simulating reduced acquisition times or administered activities. Volume-of-interest-based as well as voxel-wises statistical analyses including group contrasts were performed for 15 different acquisition times, ranging from the 10 min down to 2 sec. In addition, blinded visual reads were obtained from three readers independently for 7 different acquisition times down to 30 sec providing a diagnosis for either AD or FTD as well as the individual diagnostic certainty. Results: Regional mean uptake values changed by less than 5% at a reduced acquisition time down to 1 min in all regions and patients except for the posterior cingulate cortex of one patient. Voxel-wise group contrasts suggest a sufficient measurement time of only 2 min for which the number of significant voxels decreased by merely 5% while maintaining their spatial pattern. In 450 visual reads at reduced times, no change of the original diagnosis was observed. The diagnostic certainty showed only a very slow and mild decline with small effect sizes (Cohen's d) of 0.3 at acquisition times of 3 and 2 min compared to the original results at 10 min. Conclusion: Statistical results on region- and voxel-level as well as single-subject visual reads reveal a considerable potential to reduce the typical acquisition time (~10 min) by a factor of 4 without compromising diagnostic quality. Conversely, out data suggests that for a given acquisition time of 10 min and a similar effect size, the administered activity may be reduced to 50 MBq resulting in an effective dose of less than 1 mSv for the PET examination.",Development of Dedicated Brain PET Imaging Devices - Recent Advances and Future Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028166,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2019 06 10,"Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are not optimized for imaging small structures in the human brain.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, stomata comprise two kidney bean-shaped epidermal guard cells that flank a central pore overlying a cavity in the mesophyll. These guard cells can adjust their shape to occlude or facilitate access to this pore, and in so doing regulate the release of water vapor and oxygen from the plant, in exchange for the intake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Stomatal guard cells are the end product of a specialized lineage whose cell divisions and fate transitions ensure both the production and pattern of cells in aerial epidermal tissues. The stomatal lineage is dynamic and flexible, altering stomatal production in response to environmental change. As such, the stomatal lineage is an excellent system to study how flexible developmental transitions are regulated in plants. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster, we will summarize current knowledge of the divisions and fate decisions during stomatal development, discussing the role of transcriptional regulators, cell-cell signaling and polarity proteins. We will highlight recent work that links the core regulators to systemic or environmental information and provide an evolutionary perspective on stomata lineage regulators in plants."

However, fMRI mapping of the vestibular system, which is pivotal for our sense of balance, poses significant challenges. Physical constraints limit a subject's ability to perform motion- and balance-related tasks inside the scanner, and current stimulation techniques within the scanner are nonspecific to delineate complex vestibular nucleus (VN) pathways. Using fMRI, we examined brain-wide neural activity patterns elicited by optogenetically stimulating excitatory neurons of a major vestibular nucleus, the ipsilateral medial VN (MVN). We demonstrated robust optogenetically evoked fMRI activations bilaterally at sensorimotor cortices and their associated thalamic nuclei (auditory, visual, somatosensory, and motor), high-order cortices (cingulate, retrosplenial, temporal association, and parietal), and hippocampal formations (dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum). We then examined the modulatory effects of the vestibular system on sensory processing using auditory and visual stimulation in combination with optogenetic excitation of the MVN. We found enhanced responses to sound in the auditory cortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus ipsilateral to the stimulated MVN. In the visual pathway, we observed enhanced responses to visual stimuli in the ipsilateral visual cortex, thalamus, and contralateral superior colliculus. Taken together, our imaging findings reveal multiple brain-wide central vestibular pathways. We demonstrate large-scale modulatory effects of the vestibular system on sensory processing.",Oncogenic mutations at the EGFR ectodomain structurally converge to remove a steric hindrance on a kinase-coupled cryptic epitope.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028138,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is initiated by a large ligand-favored conformational change of the extracellular domain (ECD) from a closed, self-inhibited tethered monomer, to an open untethered state, which exposes a loop required for strong dimerization and activation. In glioblastomas (GBMs), structurally heterogeneous missense and deletion mutations concentrate at the ECD for unclear reasons. We explore the conformational impact of GBM missense mutations, combining elastic network models (ENMs) with multiple molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Our simulations reveal that the main missense class, located at the I-II interface away from the self-inhibitory tether, can unexpectedly favor spontaneous untethering to a compact intermediate state, here validated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Significantly, such intermediate is characterized by the rotation of a large ECD fragment (N-TR1), deleted in the most common GBM mutation, EGFRvIII, and that makes accessible a cryptic epitope characteristic of cancer cells. This observation suggested potential structural equivalence of missense and deletion ECD changes in GBMs. Corroborating this hypothesis, our FACS, in vitro, and in vivo data demonstrate that entirely different ECD variants all converge to remove N-TR1 steric hindrance from the 806-epitope, which we show is allosterically coupled to an intermediate kinase and hallmarks increased oncogenicity. Finally, the detected extraintracellular coupling allows for synergistic cotargeting of the intermediate with mAb806 and inhibitors, which is proved herein.",Structural and functional impact of non-synonymous SNPs in the CST complex subunit TEN1: structural genomics approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028137,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"TEN1 protein is a key component of CST complex, implicated in maintaining the telomere homeostasis, and provides stability to the eukaryotic genome. Mutations in TEN1 gene have higher chances of deleterious impact; thus, interpreting the number of mutations and their consequential impact on the structure, stability, and function is essentially important. Here, we have investigated the structural and functional consequences of nsSNPs in the TEN1 gene. A wide array of sequence- and structure-based computational prediction tools were employed to identify the effects of 78 nsSNPs on the structure and function of TEN1 protein and to identify the deleterious nsSNPs. These deleterious or destabilizing nsSNPs are scattered throughout the structure of TEN1. However, major mutations were observed in the α1-helix (12-16 residues) and β5-strand (88-96 residues). We further observed that mutations at the C-terminal region were having higher tendency to form aggregate. In-depth structural analysis of these mutations reveals that the pathogenicity of these mutations are driven mainly through larger structural changes because of alterations in non-covalent interactions. This work provides a blueprint to pinpoint the possible consequences of pathogenic mutations in the CST complex subunit TEN1.",Mapping the metabolism of five amino acids in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei using U-13C-labelled substrates and LC-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028136,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"The metabolism of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei has been the focus of numerous studies since the 1940s.

The present study also raised a number of questions regarding the origin of several metabolites, for example succinate, only a proportion of which derives from glucose. In order to answer some of these questions and explore the metabolism of bloodstream form T. brucei in more depth we followed the fate of five heavy labelled amino acids - glutamine, proline, methionine, cysteine and arginine - using an LC-MS based metabolomics approach. We found that some of these amino acids have roles beyond those previously thought and we have tentatively identified some unexpected metabolites which need to be confirmed and their function determined.",ssExpression level of GAS6-mRNA influences the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028135,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"As high expression level of growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) had an adverse effect on prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, it is interesting to reveal the relationship between GAS6-mRNA level and the survival condition of AML patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database and found 71 AML patients with GAS6-mRNA expression and received allo-HSCT treatments. We divided them into two groups based on the median expression of GAS6-mRNA. Patients with GAS6-mRNAhigh (n=36) seemed to have lower bone marrow (BM) blast (P=0.022), lower percentage of type M5 (P=0.034), lower percentage of inv(16)/CBFβ-MYH11 karyotype (P=0.020), and lower rate of good risk classification (P=0.005) than the group GAS6-mRNAlow (n= 35).

Univariate analyses showed that GAS6-mRNA was unfavorable for overall survival (OS) (P=0.044), as RUNX1 and WT1 also gave negative influences.

Methods The differentially expressed microRNAs were screened by analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. By using the survival data of the database, we analyzed correlation between patients' survival time and miR-550a expression levels. Differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis were performed using the targeted data. Results It was found that patients with high miR-550a expression levels had shorter survival time. Data mining and signal pathway enrichment analysis of TCGA database showed that abnormal miR-550a expressions affected the recurrence of tumors by the muscle system regulation. Conclusions Through the proposed investigation, miR-550a is found to be a potential biomarker as well as non-coding therapeutic target for esophagus cancer.

The clinicopathologic characteristics differ among regions, so epigenetic changes play a key role in gastric carcinogenesis. Methods: In the present study, we first demonstrate that cardamonin, a natural production of chalcone, is an anti-gastric cancer agent in pre-clinical evaluation. Results: Cardamonin inhibited proliferation and migration, induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. It could reduce the expression of apoptosis-related and migration-related genes and proteins. The constant activation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signal is a major intrinsic signal for cancer inflammation. It regulates cellular proliferation, cell cycle, and migration that are critical for cancer procession. Cardamonin could effectively down-regulate p-STAT3 and abolish activation of STAT3 through inhibiting the expression of LncRNA-PVT1. Conclusion: The present study revealed that cardamonin is a potential natural source of anti-gastric cancer drugs via epigenetic mechanism to inhibit LncRNA-PVT1-STAT3 axis."

In taxa with dimorphic sex chromosomes, pairing between them in the heterogametic sex is limited to a narrow interval of residual sequence homology known as the pseudoautosomal region (PAR). Failure to form the obligate crossover in the PAR is associated with male infertility in house mice (Mus musculus) and humans. Yet despite this apparent functional constraint, the boundary and organization of the PAR is highly variable in mammals, and even between subspecies of mice. Here, we estimate the genetic map in a previously documented expansion of the PAR in the M. musculus castaneus subspecies and show that the local recombination rate is 100-fold higher than the autosomal background. We identify an independent shift in the PAR boundary in the M. musculus musculus subspecies and show that it involves a complex rearrangement, but still recombines in heterozygous males. Finally, we demonstrate pervasive copy-number variation at the PAR boundary in wild populations of M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, and M. m. castaneus Our results suggest that the intensity of recombination activity in the PAR, coupled with relatively weak constraints on its sequence, permit the generation and maintenance of unusual levels of polymorphism in the population of unknown functional significance.",A Likelihood-Free Estimator of Population Structure Bridging Admixture Models and Principal Components Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028112,Genetics,2019 04 27,"We introduce a simple and computationally efficient method for fitting the admixture model of genetic population structure, called ALStructure. The strategy of ALStructure is to first estimate the low-dimensional linear subspace of the population admixture components and then search for a model within this subspace that is consistent with the admixture model's natural probabilistic constraints. Central to this strategy is the observation that all models belonging to this constrained space of solutions are risk-minimizing and have equal likelihood, rendering any additional optimization unnecessary. The low-dimensional linear subspace is estimated through a recently introduced principal components analysis method that is appropriate for genotype data, thereby providing a solution that has both principal components and probabilistic admixture interpretations. Our approach differs fundamentally from other existing methods for estimating admixture, which aim to fit the admixture model directly by searching for parameters that maximize the likelihood function or the posterior probability. We observe that ALStructure typically outperforms existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed under a wide array of simulated and real human genotype datasets. Throughout this work we emphasize that the admixture model is a special case of a much broader class of models for which algorithms similar to ALStructure may be successfully employed.",Meiotic MCM Proteins Promote and Inhibit Crossovers During Meiotic Recombination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028111,Genetics,2019 06 15,"Crossover formation as a result of meiotic recombination is vital for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at the end of meiosis I. In many organisms, crossovers are generated through two crossover pathways: Class I and Class II. To ensure accurate crossover formation, meiosis-specific protein complexes regulate the degree to which each pathway is used. One such complex is the mei-mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which contains MCM and MCM-like proteins REC (ortholog of Mcm8), MEI-217, and MEI-218. The mei-MCM complex genetically promotes Class I crossovers and inhibits Class II crossovers in Drosophila, but it is unclear how individual mei-MCM proteins contribute to crossover regulation. In this study, we perform genetic analyses to understand how specific regions and motifs of mei-MCM proteins contribute to Class I and II crossover formation, and distribution. Our analyses show that the long, disordered N-terminus of MEI-218 is dispensable for crossover formation, and that mutations that disrupt REC's Walker A and B motifs differentially affect Class I and Class II crossover formation. In rec Walker A mutants, Class I crossovers exhibit no change but Class II crossovers are increased. However, in rec Walker B mutants, Class I crossovers are severely impaired and Class II crossovers are increased. These results suggest that REC may form multiple complexes that exhibit differential REC-dependent ATP-binding and -hydrolyzing requirements. These results provide genetic insight into the mechanisms through which mei-MCM proteins promote Class I crossovers and inhibit Class II crossovers.",SERUM CHROMIUM LEVELS ARE HIGHER IN PERITONEAL DIALYSIS THAN IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028110,Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2019 04 27,"An elevation in serum chromium levels in individuals treated with renal replacement therapy has been previously described, but chromium levels have not been systematically studied in patients treated with different dialysis modalities.

Notably, withdrawal severity is independent of maternal buprenorphine dose, suggesting that interindividual variance in pharmacokinetics may influence risk and severity of NOWS. Using a rat model of NOWS, we tested the hypothesis that clinically relevant doses of the active metabolite norbuprenorphine (NorBUP) can induce in utero opioid dependence, manifested as naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal signs in the neonate. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were implanted with 14-day osmotic minipumps containing vehicle, morphine (positive control), or NorBUP (0.3-10 mg/kg per day) on gestation day 9. By 12 hours post-delivery, an intraperitoneal injection of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (1 or 10 mg/kg) or saline was administered to pups. Precipitated withdrawal signs were graded by raters blinded to treatment conditions. In a separate group, NorBUP concentrations in maternal and fetal blood and brain on gestation day 20 were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Steady-state maternal blood concentrations of NorBUP in dams infused with 1 or 3 mg/kg per day were comparable to values reported in pregnant humans treated with buprenorphine (1.0 and 9.6 ng/ml, respectively), suggesting a clinically relevant dosing regimen. At these doses, NorBUP increased withdrawal severity in the neonate as shown by an evaluation of 10 withdrawal indicators. These findings support the possibility that NorBUP contributes to fetal opioid dependence and NOWS following maternal buprenorphine treatment during pregnancy.",The gastric sieve of penaeid shrimp species is a sub-micrometer nutrient filter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028105,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 05 18,"Unlike that of vertebrates, the penaeid shrimp stomach is of ectodermic origin and is thus covered by a cuticle that is sloughed upon molting. It is composed of two chambers, here called the anterior and posterior stomach chambers, ASC and PSC, respectively. The PSC contains a filtration structure variously called a pyloric filter, filter press, gastric filter or gastric sieve (GS), and the last of these will be used here. The GS resembles an elongated, inverted-V, dome-like, chitinous structure with a midline ridge that is integral to the ventral base of the PSC. The dome surface is covered with a carpet-like layer of minute, comb-like setae bearing laterally branching setulae. This carpet serves as a selective filter that excludes large partially digested food particles but allows smaller particles and soluble materials to enter hepatopancreatic ducts that conduct them into the shrimp hepatopancreas (HP), where further digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. Although the GS function is well known, its exclusion limit for particulate material has not been clearly defined. Using histological and ultra-structure analysis, we show that the GS sieve pore diameter is approximately 0.2-0.7 µm in size, indicating a size exclusion limit of substantially less than 1 µm. Using fluorescent microbeads, we show that particles of 1 µm diameter could not pass through the GS but that particles of 0.1 µm diameter did pass through to accumulate in longitudinal grooves and move on to the HP, where some were internalized by tubule epithelial cells. We found no significant difference in these sizes between the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei or between juveniles and adults in P. vannamei This information will be of value for the design of particulate feed ingredients such as nutrients, therapeutic drugs and toxin-absorbing materials that may selectively target the stomach, intestine or HP of cultivated shrimp.",Parabronchial remodeling in chicks in response to embryonic hypoxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028104,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 05 17,"The embryonic development of parabronchi occurs mainly during the second half of incubation in precocious birds, which makes this phase sensitive to possible morphological modifications induced by O2 supply limitation. Thus, we hypothesized that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development induces morphological changes that remain after hatching. To test this hypothesis, chicken embryos were incubated entirely (21 days) under normoxia or partially under hypoxia (15% O2 during days 12 to 18). Lung structures, including air capillaries, blood capillaries, infundibula, atria, parabronchial lumen, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries and interparabronchial tissue, in 1- and 10-day-old chicks were analyzed using light microscopy-assisted stereology. Tissue barrier and surface area of air capillaries were measured using electron microscopy-assisted stereology, allowing for calculation of the anatomical diffusion factor. Hypoxia increased the relative volumes of air and blood capillaries, structures directly involved in gas exchange, but decreased the relative volumes of atria in both groups of chicks, and the parabronchial lumen in older chicks. Accordingly, the surface area of the air capillaries and the anatomical diffusion factor were increased under hypoxic incubation. Treatment did not alter total lung volume, relative volumes of infundibula, bronchi, blood vessels larger than capillaries, interparabronchial tissue or the tissue barrier of any group. We conclude that hypoxia during the embryonic phase of parabronchial development leads to a morphological remodeling, characterized by increased volume density and respiratory surface area of structures involved in gas exchange at the expense of structures responsible for air conduction in chicks up to 10 days old.",The Migration of Arizona's Post-Insanity Defense Procedures to a Modified GBMI Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028103,The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,2019 06 11,"Arizona's insanity defense and post-insanity procedures have evolved over the last 30 years into a unique system. Arizona moved from a typical M'Naughten-based insanity defense to an adaptation of the Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB) model and then to its current form, in which the PSRB is cast in a correctional framework. These changes have resulted in a correctional statute, with outcomes that may subject the guilty except insane (GEI) offender to a disposition similar to that of someone found guilty but mentally ill (GBMI). We review the literature on the GBMI defense first developed in Michigan in the 1970s and compare Arizona's current system to the earlier GBMI models. We conclude with a discussion of Arizona's GEI verdict and implications of managing these offenders in a correctional framework, resulting in a modified GBMI statute.",TET enzymes augment activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression via 5-hydroxymethylcytosine modifications at the Aicda superenhancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028100,Science immunology,2019 06 15,"TET enzymes are dioxygenases that promote DNA demethylation by oxidizing the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we report a close correspondence between 5hmC-marked regions, chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity in B cells, and a strong enrichment for consensus binding motifs for basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors at TET-responsive genomic regions. Functionally, Tet2 and Tet3 regulate class switch recombination (CSR) in murine B cells by enhancing expression of Aicda, which encodes the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) enzyme essential for CSR. TET enzymes deposit 5hmC, facilitate DNA demethylation, and maintain chromatin accessibility at two TET-responsive enhancer elements, TetE1 and TetE2, located within a superenhancer in the Aicda locus. Our data identify the bZIP transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) as a key transcription factor involved in TET-dependent Aicda expression. 5hmC is not deposited at TetE1 in activated Batf-deficient B cells, indicating that BATF facilitates TET recruitment to this Aicda enhancer. Our study emphasizes the importance of TET enzymes for bolstering AID expression and highlights 5hmC as an epigenetic mark that captures enhancer dynamics during cell activation."

We evaluated the incremental benefit of targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in the identification of gene fusions and MET exon 14 (METex14) alterations in DNA sequencing (DNAseq) driver-negative lung cancers.Experimental Design: Lung cancers driver negative by MSK-IMPACT underwent further analysis using a custom RNAseq panel (MSK-Fusion). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was assessed as a potential prioritization criterion for targeted RNAseq.Results: As part of prospective clinical genomic testing, we profiled 2,522 lung adenocarcinomas using MSK-IMPACT, which identified 195 (7.7%) fusions and 119 (4.7%) METex14 alterations. Among 275 driver-negative cases with available tissue, 254 (92%) had sufficient material for RNAseq. A previously undetected alteration was identified in 14% (36/254) of cases, 33 of which were actionable (27 in-frame fusions, 6 METex14). Of these 33 patients, 10 then received matched targeted therapy, which achieved clinical benefit in 8 (80%). In the 32% (81/254) of DNAseq driver-negative cases with low TMB [0-5 mutations/Megabase (mut/Mb)], 25 (31%) were positive for previously undetected gene fusions on RNAseq, whereas, in 151 cases with TMB >5 mut/Mb, only 7% were positive for fusions (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: Targeted RNAseq assays should be used in all cases that appear driver negative by DNAseq assays to ensure comprehensive detection of actionable gene rearrangements. Furthermore, we observed a significant enrichment for fusions in DNAseq driver-negative samples with low TMB, supporting the prioritization of such cases for additional RNAseq.",Inhibiting Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 Type I Receptor Signaling Promotes Remyelination by Potentiating Oligodendrocyte Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028086,eNeuro,2019 06 10,"Blocking inhibitory factors within CNS demyelinating lesions is regarded as a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an inhibitory factor present in demyelinating lesions. Noggin, an endogenous antagonist to BMP, has previously been shown to increase the number of oligodendrocytes and promote remyelination in vivo. However, it remains unclear how BMP4 signaling inhibits remyelination. Here we investigated the downstream signaling pathway that mediates the inhibitory effect that BMP4 exerts upon remyelination through pharmacological and transgenic approaches. Using the cuprizone mouse model of central demyelination, we demonstrate that selectively blocking BMP4 signaling via the pharmacological inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the extent of remyelination in vivo This was accompanied by the downregulation of transcriptional targets that suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation. Further, selective deletion of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA) within primary mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) significantly enhanced their differentiation and subsequent myelination in vitro Together, the results of this study identify that BMP4 signals via BMPRIA within OPCs to inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation and their capacity to myelinate axons, and suggest that blocking the BMP4/BMPRIA pathway in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.",Bronchioalveolar stem cells are a main source for regeneration of distal lung epithelia in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028085,The EMBO journal,2019 04 27,"Bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) are a potential source for lung regeneration, but direct in vivo evidence for a multipotential lineage contribution during homeostasis and disease is critically missing, since specific genetic labeling of BASCs has not been possible. We developed a novel cell tracing approach based on intein-mediated assembly of newly engineered split-effectors, allowing selective targeting of dual-marker expressing BASCs in the mouse lung. RNA sequencing of isolated BASCs demonstrates that BASCs show a distinct transcriptional profile, characterized by co-expression of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial genes. We found that BASCs generate the majority of distal lung airway cells after bronchiolar damage but only moderately contribute to cellular turnover under homeostatic conditions. Importantly, DTA-mediated ablation of BASCs compromised proper regeneration of distal airways. The study defines BASCs as crucial components of the lung repair machinery and provides a paradigmatic example for the detection and manipulation of stem cells that cannot be recognized by a single marker alone.",Triggering MSR1 promotes JNK-mediated inflammation in IL-4-activated macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028084,The EMBO journal,2019 06 10,"Alternatively activated M2 macrophages play an important role in maintenance of tissue homeostasis by scavenging dead cells, cell debris and lipoprotein aggregates via phagocytosis. Using proteomics, we investigated how alternative activation, driven by IL-4, modulated the phagosomal proteome to control macrophage function. Our data indicate that alternative activation enhances homeostatic functions such as proteolysis, lipolysis and nutrient transport. Intriguingly, we identified the enhanced recruitment of the TAK1/MKK7/JNK signalling complex to phagosomes of IL-4-activated macrophages. The recruitment of this signalling complex was mediated through K63 polyubiquitylation of the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1). Triggering of MSR1 in IL-4-activated macrophages leads to enhanced JNK activation, thereby promoting a phenotypic switch from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory state, which was abolished upon MSR1 deletion or JNK inhibition. Moreover, MSR1 K63 polyubiquitylation correlated with the activation of JNK signalling in ovarian cancer tissue from human patients, suggesting that it may be relevant for macrophage phenotypic shift in vivo Altogether, we identified that MSR1 signals through JNK via K63 polyubiquitylation and provides evidence for the receptor's involvement in macrophage polarization.",Beyond the seed: structural basis for supplementary microRNA targeting by human Argonaute2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028083,The EMBO journal,2019 06 14,"microRNAs (miRNAs) guide Argonaute proteins to mRNAs targeted for repression. Target recognition occurs primarily through the miRNA seed region, composed of guide (g) nucleotides g2-g8. However, nucleotides beyond the seed are also important for some known miRNA-target interactions. Here, we report the structure of human Argonaute2 (Ago2) engaged with a target RNA recognized through both miRNA seed and supplementary (g13-g16) regions. Ago2 creates a ""supplementary chamber"" that accommodates up to five miRNA-target base pairs. Seed and supplementary chambers are adjacent to each other and can be bridged by an unstructured target loop of 1-15 nucleotides. Opening of the supplementary chamber may be constrained by tension in the miRNA 3' tail, as increases in miRNA length stabilize supplementary interactions. Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrate that optimal supplementary interactions can increase target affinity > 20-fold. These results provide a mechanism for extended miRNA targeting, suggest a function for 3' isomiRs in tuning miRNA targeting specificity, and indicate that supplementary interactions may contribute more to target recognition than is widely appreciated.",Different Patterns of Conditional Survival of Breast Cancer Patients by Age and Histologic types: Evidence from the Korean Nationwide Registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028082,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2019 04 27,"Conditional relative survival (CRS), which is the survival estimate of patients who have already survived for a certain period of time after diagnosis, could provide more relevant information on the current prognosis of cancer survivors than the standard 5-year relative survival (RS).

Sequencing classification was compared with mismatch repair protein IHC. Cancers with microsatellite instability by sequencing were analyzed using a testing protocol to identify patients with Lynch syndrome.Results: Sequencing identified microsatellite instability in 3.6% (23/645) of upper gastrointestinal tract cancers, including 28% (8/29) of small intestinal and 9% (9/97) of gastric carcinomas. In 20 cancers classified as having microsatellite instability, 19 demonstrated loss of expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, or MSH6, and one cancer was indeterminate by IHC. In contrast, 52 control cancers demonstrated retained expression of all mismatch repair proteins. Using targeted sequencing as the initial screening test, 1.1% (7/645) of patients were identified to have pathogenic germline variants confirming a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome.Conclusions: Targeted cancer next-generation sequencing is an accurate first-line test to detect microsatellite instability in upper gastrointestinal tract cancers.Impact: This study provides a proof of concept for the use of targeted next-generation sequencing to detect microsatellite instability and screen for Lynch syndrome.",Vitamin D Signaling Suppresses Early Prostate Carcinogenesis in TgAPT121 Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028080,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2019 06 04,"We tested whether lifelong modification of vitamin D signaling can alter the progression of early prostate carcinogenesis in studies using mice that develop high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that is similar to humans. Two tissue-limited models showed that prostate vitamin D receptor (VDR) loss increased prostate carcinogenesis. In another study, we fed diets with three vitamin D3 levels (inadequate = 25 IU/kg diet, adequate for bone health = 150 IU/kg, or high = 1,000 IU/kg) and two calcium levels (adequate for bone health = 0.5% and high = 1.5%). Dietary vitamin D caused a dose-dependent increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and a reduction in the percentage of mice with adenocarcinoma but did not improve bone mass. In contrast, high calcium suppressed serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and improved bone mass but increased the incidence of adenocarcinoma. Analysis of the VDR cistrome in RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells revealed vitamin D-mediated regulation of multiple cancer-relevant pathways. Our data support the hypothesis that the loss of vitamin D signaling accelerates the early stages of prostate carcinogenesis, and our results suggest that different dietary requirements may be needed to support prostate health or maximize bone mass. SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows that disrupting vitamin D signaling through diet or genetic deletion increases early prostate carcinogenesis through multiple pathways.

Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is not only one of the most widely-used phthalates but also a member of EEDs with the estrogenic property. Although some studies have revealed the negative effect of DBP on the reproductive system, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Here the effect of DBP on P450 aromatase, a rate-limiting enzyme stimulated by FSH in the estradiol synthesis, was investigated in human granulosa cell line KGN. Cultured cells were treated with FSH and various doses of DBP (0.1μM, 1μM, 10μM, 50μM, or 100μM) for 24hr. Then the expression of aromatase was assessed, and the synthesis of estradiol was detected to reflect aromatase activity. As shown by the results, all concentrations of DBP could up-regulate the mRNA as well as protein levels of aromatase, and 0.1μM DBP increased the production of estradiol significantly. Furthermore, the ovary-specific promoter of aromatase, promoter II, was activated by 0.1μM DBP, and the expression of FSH receptor (FSHR) was increased by DBP from 0.1μM to 100μM. The study results show that DBP can affect aromatase from both quantitative and functional aspects, and this process may involve the activation of aromatase promoter II and upregulation of FSHR in KGN. Additionally, low-concentration DBP, near human serum concentration, has a more robust effect. This study suggests that DBP may affect the steroidogenic capacity in human ovaries and contributes to our understanding of the effects of DBP on the female reproductive system.",Clinical and Prognostic Value of Human Mammary Tumor Virus in Korean Patients with Breast Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028060,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,2019 04 27,"Human mammary tumor virus (HMTV) is 90-95% homologous to mouse mammary tumor virus, one of the causal agents of murine mammary tumors.

A previous study involving human hepatocytes showed the primary route of midazolam metabolism, 1'-hydroxylation, shifted to N-glucuronidation in the presence of the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole, which may lead to an overprediction of the magnitude of a xenobiotic-midazolam interaction. Because ketoconazole is no longer recommended as a clinical CYP3A inhibitor, indinavir was selected as an alternate CYP3A inhibitor to evaluate the contribution of the N-glucuronidation pathway to midazolam metabolism. The effects of indinavir on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and N-glucuronidation were first characterized in human-derived in vitro systems. Compared with vehicle, indinavir (10 μM) inhibited midazolam 1'-hydroxylation by recombinant CYP3A4, human liver microsomes, and high-CYP3A activity cryopreserved human hepatocytes by ≥70%; the IC50 obtained with hepatocytes (2.7 μM) was within reported human unbound indinavir Cmax (≤5 μM). Midazolam N-glucuronidation in hepatocytes increased in the presence of indinavir in both a concentration-dependent (1-33 μM) and time-dependent (0-4 hours) manner (by up to 2.5-fold), prompting assessment in human volunteers (n = 8). As predicted by these in vitro data, indinavir was a strong inhibitor of the 1'-hydroxylation pathway, decreasing the 1'-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)0-12h ratio by 80%. Although not statistically significant, the midazolam N-glucuronide/midazolam AUC0-12h ratio increased by 40%, suggesting a shift to the N-glucuronidation pathway. The amount of midazolam N-glucuronide recovered in urine increased 4-fold but remained <10% of the oral midazolam dose (2.5 mg).

These disparities continue to persist in current literature. The gas chromatographic methods found that the absolute bioavailability of d-(R,R)-MPH is 23% and that of l-(S,S)-MPH is 5% (i.e., 82% exists as the active d-isomer), while liquid chromatographic methods consistently report that approximately 99% of circulating MPH is d-MPH. The older methods used perfluoroacylated S-prolyl derivatizing agents which have a history of imprecision due to the susceptibility of the prolyl S-configuration to isomerize to the R-enantiomer. Accordingly, any R-prolyl impurity in the chiral derivatization reagent will yield the (R,R,R)-MPH-prolyl diastereomer from d-MPH which, in being related as the opposite enantiomer of (S,S,S)-prolyl-MPH, co-elutes with l-(S,S)-MPH. This results in overestimating the percent l-MPH at the expense of underestimating d-MPH. Thus, unless compelling reasons exist to justify use of any chiral discriminators, then less complex and less costly achiral analyses of plasma dl-MPH fundamentally allows d-MPH quantitation since 99% exists as d-MPH. However, simultaneous monitoring of both d-MPH and l-MPH appear warranted when alterations in first-pass hepatic metabolism by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) occurs. For examples: (a) using transdermal dl-MPH delivery; (b) in cases of concomitant dl-MPH and a CES1 inhibitor, e.g., ethanol, which especially elevates l-MPH concentrations; (d) in forensic studies of intravenous/intranasal dl-MPH abuse or (e) were dl-MPH to be formulated as a free base sublingual product for direct oral mucosal transport.

In addition to having impaired development of teeth, hair, eccrine sweat glands, and salivary and mammary glands, HED patients have ear, nose and throat disease. The mouse strains Tabby (EdaTa ) and downless (Edardl-J/dl-J ) have rhinitis and otitis media due to loss of submucosal glands in the upper airway. We report that prenatal correction of EDAR signalling in EdaTa mice with the agonist anti-EDAR antibody rescues the auditory-tube submucosal glands and prevents otitis media, rhinitis and nasopharyngitis. The sparse- and wavy-haired (swh) rat strain carries a mutation in the Edaradd gene and has similar cutaneous HED phenotypes to mouse models. We report that auditory-tube submucosal glands are smaller in the homozygous mutant Edaraddswh/swh than those in unaffected heterozygous Edaraddswh/+ rats, and that this predisposes them to otitis media. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of otitis media in the rat HED model differs from that in mice, as otitis media is the primary pathology, and rhinitis is a later-onset phenotype. These findings in rodent HED models imply that hypomorphic as well as null mutations in EDAR signalling pathway genes may predispose to otitis media in humans. In addition, this work suggests that the recent successful prenatal treatment of X-linked HED (XLHED) in humans may also prevent ear, nose and throat disease, and provides diagnostic criteria that distinguish HED-associated otitis media from chronic otitis media with effusion, which is common in children.",Differential Effects of Depleting versus Programming Tumor-Associated Macrophages on Engineered T Cells in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028033,Cancer immunology research,2019 06 10,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy resistant to therapies, including immune-checkpoint blockade. We investigated two distinct strategies to modulate tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) to enhance cellular therapy targeting mesothelin in an autochthonous PDA mouse model. Administration of an antibody to colony-stimulating factor (anti-Csf1R) depleted Ly6Clow protumorigenic TAMs and significantly enhanced endogenous T-cell intratumoral accumulation. Despite increasing the number of endogenous T cells at the tumor site, as previously reported, TAM depletion had only minimal impact on intratumoral accumulation and persistence of T cells engineered to express a murine mesothelin-specific T-cell receptor (TCR). TAM depletion interfered with the antitumor activity of the infused T cells in PDA, evidenced by reduced tumor cell apoptosis. In contrast, TAM programming with agonistic anti-CD40 increased both Ly6Chigh TAMs and the intratumoral accumulation and longevity of TCR-engineered T cells. Anti-CD40 significantly increased the frequency and number of proliferating and granzyme B+ engineered T cells, and increased tumor cell apoptosis. However, anti-CD40 failed to rescue intratumoral engineered T-cell IFNγ production. Thus, although functional modulation, rather than TAM depletion, enhanced the longevity of engineered T cells and increased tumor cell apoptosis, ultimately, anti-CD40 modulation was insufficient to rescue key effector defects in tumor-reactive T cells. This study highlights critical distinctions between how endogenous T cells that evolve in vivo, and engineered T cells with previously acquired effector activity, respond to modifications of the tumor microenvironment.",Microbial communities in different developmental stages of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis are associated with differentially expressed peptidoglycan recognition protein genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028032,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 27,"The insect microbiota can change dramatically to enable adaptation of the host in different developmental stages and environments; however, little is known about how the host maintains its microbiota to achieve such adaptations. In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the microorganisms in larvae and adults of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis are primarily Gram negative bacteria but that the major components in pupae are Gram positive bacteria. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and transcriptome analysis, we screened two specifically expressed peptidoglycan recognition protein genes (PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB1) and analyzed their relationship to B. dorsalis microbial communities. Knockdown of PGRP-LB in larvae and adults led to increased ratios of Gram positive bacteria; knockdown of PGRP-SB1 in pupae led to increased ratios of Gram negative bacteria. Our results suggest that maintenance of the microbiota in different developmental stages of B. dorsalis may be associated with PGRP-LB and PGRP-SB1.ImportanceMicroorganisms are ubiquitous in insects and have widespread impacts on multiple aspects of insect biology. However, the microorganisms present in insects can change dramatically in different developmental stages, and it is critical to maintain the appropriate microorganisms in specific host developmental stages. Therefore, analysis of the factors associated with the microbiota in specific development stages of the host is needed. Here, we apply suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) combined with transcriptome analysis to investigate whether the microbiota in development stages of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis is associated with expression of PGRP genes. We found that two different PGRP genes were specifically expressed during development and that these genes may be associated with changes in microbial communities in different developmental stages of B. dorsalis.",Viable and total bacterial populations undergo equipment- and time-dependent shifts during milk processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028031,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 27,"We set out to identify the viable and total bacterial content in milk as it passes through a large-scale, dairy product-manufacturing plant for pasteurization, concentration, separation, blending, and storage prior to cheese manufacture. A total of 142 milk samples were collected from up to 10 pieces of equipment for a period spanning 21 h on two collection dates in the spring and late summer of 2014. Bacterial composition in the milk was determined by 16S rRNA marker gene, high-throughput DNA sequencing. Milk samples from the late summer were paired such that half were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to enrich for viable cells prior to quantification by PCR and identification by DNA sequence analysis. Streptococcus had the highest median relative abundance across all sampling sites within the facility on both sampling dates. Proportions of Anoxybacillus, Thermus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Micrococcaceae, and Pseudomonas were also elevated in some samples. Viable cells detected by PMA treatment showed that Turicibacter was enriched after High Temperature Short Time (HTST) pasteurization, whereas proportions of Staphylococcus were significantly reduced. Using cleaning in place (CIP) times as a reference point, Bacillus or Anoxybacillus comprised 30% of total bacteria in 5 out of 17 samples collected from recently cleaned silos (< 19 h since CIP). At later times (>19 h after CIP), 10 out of 11 silos contained elevated viable cell numbers and were enriched in Acinetobacter and/or Lactococcus These results show the tremendous, point-to-point and sample variation in bacterial composition in milk during processing.IMPORTANCEMilk undergoes sustained contact with the built environment during processing into finished dairy products. This contact has the potential to influence the introduction, viability, and growth of microorganisms within the milk. Currently, the population dynamics of bacteria in milk undergoing processing are not well understood. Therefore, we measured total and viable bacterial cell numbers and composition in milk over time and at different processing points in a cheese manufacture facility in California. Our results provide new perspectives on the dramatic variations in microbial populations in milk during processing even over short amounts of time. Although some of the changes in the milk microbiota were predictable (e.g. reduced viable cell numbers after pasteurization), other findings could not be easily foreseen based on knowledge of bacteria contained in raw milk or when the equipment was last cleaned. This information is important for predicting and controlling microbial spoilage contaminants in dairy products.",Effect of ceftiofur cessation and substitution with lincomycin-spectinomycin on extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase/AmpC genes and multidrug resistance in Escherichia coli from a Canadian broiler production pyramid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028030,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 27,"Ceftiofur, a third generation cephalosporin antimicrobial, was used in Canadian hatcheries for many years to prevent early mortality in chicks, leading to a high prevalence of cephalosporin resistance in Escherichia coli in chickens. Preventive use of ceftiofur in hatcheries ceased in 2014. We examined the effect of ceftiofur cessation (n=40 flocks with ceftiofur, n=28 flocks without antimicrobial at hatchery) and its replacement with an antimicrobial combination, lincomycin-spectinomycin, (n=32) at the hatchery on the proportion of samples with E. coli positive for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC β-lactamase related genes, and on the multidrug resistance profiles of ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli in broilers and their associated breeders (n=46 samples), at one year post-cessation. For indicator E. coli from non-enriched media, a significant decrease post-cessation in the proportion of samples harboring E. coli isolates positive for blaCMY-2 and/or blaCTX-M was observed. In contrast, following enrichment in medium containing ceftriaxone (1mg/L) to facilitate recovery of ESBL/AmpC β-lactamase producing E. coli colonies, both pre- and post-cessation, 99% of the samples harbored E. coli positive for blaCMY-2 or blaCTX-M Among the 15 tested antimicrobial agents, flocks receiving lincomycin-spectinomycin after cessation of ceftiofur showed a significantly greater non-susceptibility to aminoglycosides, folate inhibitors, phenicols, tetracyclines and possible extensively drug resistant E. coli compared to those receiving ceftiofur or no antimicrobial at hatchery. This study clearly demonstrates an initial decrease in ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli following the cessation of ceftiofur in hatchery but an increase in antimicrobial non-β-lactam resistance of ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli following replacement with lincomycin-spectinomycin.ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is a global problem. The antimicrobial ceftiofur has been used worldwide for disease prevention in poultry production, resulting in a greatly increased resistance to this antimicrobial important in poultry and human medicine. Our study examines the impact of ceftiofur cessation and its replacement with the antimicrobial combination lincomycin-spectinomycin, a common practice in the industry. Our study demonstrated a decrease in ceftiofur resistance after the cessation of its use, although the resistance genes remain ubiquitous in all phases of poultry production, showing that poultry remains a reservoir for ceftiofur resistance and requiring continued vigilance. We also observed a decrease in multidrug resistance involving different antimicrobial classes after cessation of ceftiofur but an increase following use of lincomycin-spectinomycin, indicating that this antimicrobial use should be questioned. Reduced resistance to ceftiofur in poultry may translate to better treatment efficacy, decreased morbidity/mortality and enhance food safety for humans.",Agricultural origins of a highly-persistent lineage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in New Zealand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028029,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 04 27,"Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are human and animal gut commensals. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are important opportunistic pathogens with limited treatment options. Historically, the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and avoparcin selected for the emergence of vancomycin resistance in human and animal isolates respectively, resulting in global cessation of avoparcin use between 1997 and 2000. To better understand human and animal-associated VRE strains in the post-avoparcin era, we sequenced the genomes of 231 VRE isolates from New Zealand (NZ) (75 human clinical, 156 poultry) cultured between 1998 and 2009. E. faecium lineages and their antibiotic resistance carriage patterns strictly delineated between agricultural and human reservoirs, with bacitracin resistance ubiquitous in poultry but absent in clinical E. faecium strains. In contrast, one E. faecalis lineage (ST108) predominated in both poultry and human isolates in the three years following avoparcin discontinuation. Both phylogenetic and antimicrobial susceptibility (i.e. ubiquitous bacitracin resistance in both poultry and clinical ST108 isolates) analyses suggest an agricultural origin for the ST108 lineage. VRE isolate resistomes were carried on multiple, heterogeneous plasmids. In some isolate genomes, bacitracin, erythromycin, and vancomycin resistance elements were co-localized, indicating multiple potentially-linked selection mechanisms.Importance: Historical antimicrobial use in NZ agriculture has driven the evolution of ST108, a VRE lineage carrying a range of clinically-relevant antimicrobial resistances. The persistence of this lineage in NZ for over a decade indicates that co-selection may be an important stabilizing mechanism for its persistence."

The motor altered the length of a cable running through the socket panels according to commands communicated from a mobile phone. A proportional-integral-derivative controller adjusted the voltage applied to the motor via pulse-width modulation to achieve target settings. Bench test results showed that when the system was subjected to loads comparable to those expected during clinical use, maximum absolute steady state error was 0.036 mm.

Neurologic manifestation in central nervous system (CNS) is less frequent than the peripheral and usually is in form of stroke. Few cases of lateral medullary ischemic stroke (Wallenberg syndrome) due to GPA have been reported. A 41 year-old female, presented with acute vertigo, nausea/vomiting, hiccups, dysphagia. In physical examination she had a saddled nose, horner syndrome, soft palate paralysis, crossed hypoesthesia of face, and limbs and hemi-ataxia. Brain magnetic imaging revealed a left lateral medullary infarction and sinusitis confirmed by paranasal Sinus CT scans. Chest CT showed a cavitary mass. Laboratory findings were remarkable for anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. Cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)/anti-proteinase 3 was positive. Diagnosis of GPA was established and treatment was started. During 6-month follow-up improvement was satisfying and no relapses occurred. Medullary infarct is reported in few GPA patients, especially at presentation. Definite diagnosis is based on tissue biopsy. Although in context of extra CNS involvement and positive ANCA diagnosis can be made confidently. Treatment of choice in CNS involvement is not clear, corticosteroids and immunosuppressives seem effective. CNS involvement, especially stroke may present GPA or accompany extra CNS symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential.",Total femur replacement in non-oncologic indications: Functional and radiological outcomes from a French survey with a mean 6 years' follow-up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027981,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR",2019 05 31,"There are few published studies on total femur replacement (TFR) because its indications are rare. Other than malignant diseases, the indications extend to revisions and interprosthetic femur fractures; however, the outcomes of these indications have not been well defined. The aim of this retrospective survey was to analyze the complication rate and functional outcomes of these newer indications.",Clinical and radiographic results of partial versus total meniscectomy in patients with symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027980,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR",2019 05 31,Some reports have noted favorable long-term clinical results with milder postoperative arthritic changes after total meniscectomy in symptomatic patients with torn discoid lateral meniscus (DLM). This meta-analysis was conducted to compare the clinical and radiographic results between partial and total meniscectomy in patients with symptomatic DLM.,Analysis of the trends in arthroscopic meniscectomy and meniscus repair procedures in France from 2005 to 2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027979,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR",2019 05 31,"In 2008, the French National Authority for Health (HAS) recommended that ""conservative"" treatments be adopted for meniscal lesions. This recommendation and the lack of superiority of meniscectomy over non-operative treatment for meniscus degeneration have modified the treatment pathway. However, the impact of these findings on French clinical practice is not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the change over time in the number of alternative surgical procedures (meniscectomy and meniscus repair) and regional variation in France using data from the French agency for information on hospital care (ATIH)."
