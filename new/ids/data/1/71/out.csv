The main aim of the present study was to evaluate an age-specific 45-min educational program, designed in accordance with the current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines and physical activity (PA) guidelines, among adolescents and adults. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the health-promoting lifestyle habits by the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP-II) at baseline and following 6⁻8 weeks post-education in a nationally representative sample of Serbian adolescents and adults (n = 3822). Results: The percentage of adolescents eating 3⁻5 servings of vegetables per day increased at follow-up (20.1% versus 23.1%, p = 0.001), with significantly more adolescents regularly reading food labels (from 12.2% at baseline to 14.2% at follow-up; p = 0.02). Taken together, mean HPLP-II scores in adolescents significantly improved for both diet (0.05 points; p < 0.0001) and PA (0.09 points; p < 0.0001), and for PA in adults (0.08 points; p < 0.0001). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that our model as a whole (including time of testing as a predictor variable, and age and gender as control variables) explained 3.0% of the variance in mean HPLP-II scores for diet (p = 0.942) and 3.0% for PA (p = 0.285) in adolescents, and 1.1% of the variance in HPLP-II scores for diet (p = 0.781) and 1.9% for PA (p = 0.075) in adults, respectively. Conclusions: It appears that a brief focused education can positively tackle unhealthy lifestyles in promoting good health in general population. Different modes of interactive communication used here appeared to strengthen participants' capacities for lifestyle changes.",The Role of Proteases in the Virulence of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720762,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 02 28,"A pathogenic lifestyle is inextricably linked with the constant necessity of facing various challenges exerted by the external environment (both within and outside the host). To successfully colonize the host and establish infection, pathogens have evolved sophisticated systems to combat the host defense mechanisms and also to be able to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Proteases, as crucial components of these systems, are involved in a variety of processes associated with infection. In phytopathogenic bacteria, they play important regulatory roles and modulate the expression and functioning of various virulence factors. Secretory proteases directly help avoid recognition by the plant immune systems, and contribute to the deactivation of the defense response pathways. Finally, proteases are important components of protein quality control systems, and thus enable maintaining homeostasis in stressed bacterial cells. In this review, we discuss the known protease functions and protease-regulated signaling processes associated with virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria.",Photodegradation and Biodegradation of Poly(Lactic) Acid Containing Orotic Acid as a Nucleation Agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720761,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"Orotic acid is a natural heterocyclic compound that acts as a nucleation agent in poly(lactic acid) (PLA). PLA materials with increasing orotic acid content were prepared and characterized. It was found that crystallinity of about 28% was reached with 0.3% content of the agent. Further enhancement in the content of the agent did not provoke any additional significant increase of crystallinity. Subsequently, it was investigated whether the orotic acid content affected photodegradation of PLA and, in the next phase, its biodegradation. The results of rheological measurements showed that the compound slightly accelerates photodegradation of the material, which was accompanied by the cleavage of PLA chains. Previous photodegradation was shown to accelerate the subsequent biodegradation by shortening the lag phase of the process, where the explanation is probably in the reduction of the polymer molecular weight during the photodegradation. Moreover, the presence of orotic acid in both initial and photodegraded samples was found to influence biodegradation positively by shortening the lag phase and increasing the observed maximal rate of the biodegradation.",Welding Characteristics Analysis and Application on Spacecraft of Friction Stir Welded 2A14-T6 Aluminum Alloy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720760,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"According to the actual size parameters, the finite element model (FEM) of friction stir welding (FSW) was established, and the FEM was updated by experiments. The FSW of the 2A14-T6 high-strength aluminum alloy was simulated under a reasonable welding process parameter range, and the welding process parameters with good simulation effect were determined. The test was carried out under the same parameters, and the axial force of the FSW tool and temperature of the workpiece measuring point were collected. The comparison between the simulated data and the experimental data is reasonable, indicating the correctness of the FEM. The microstructure analysis of the welded joint shows that the grain size in the upper part of the weld nugget was smaller than that in the middle and lower parts, and there are obvious boundaries of grain size in each region of the joint. The hardness of the joint in the upper layer is higher than that in the middle and lower layers, and the minimum Vickers hardness value of the joint appears near the interface between the thermo-mechanically affected zone and the heat-affected zone on both sides of the weld. Tensile testing shows that the strength coefficient of the joint reaches 82.5% under this process parameter, and the sample breaks at the intersection of the material flow during stretching. After analyzing the final mechanical properties of the joint, we found that a degree of aerospace application can be achieved. Under this parameter, the welding test was carried out on the top cover of the rocket fuel tank. Firstly, melon valve welding, which is relatively difficult in welding conditions, was carried out, and a high-quality joint with good surface and no defects was obtained.","Prostate Cancer Disparity, Chemoprevention, and Treatment by Specific Medicinal Plants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720759,Nutrients,2019 04 10,"Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers in men. The global burden of this disease is rising. Its incidence and mortality rates are higher in African American (AA) men compared to white men and other ethnic groups. The treatment decisions for PC are based exclusively on histological architecture, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and local disease state. Despite advances in screening for and early detection of PC, a large percentage of men continue to be diagnosed with metastatic disease including about 20% of men affected with a high mortality rate within the African American population. As such, this population group may benefit from edible natural products that are safe with a low cost. Hence, the central goal of this article is to highlight PC disparity associated with nutritional factors and highlight chemo-preventive agents from medicinal plants that are more likely to reduce PC. To reach this central goal, we searched the PubMed Central database and the Google Scholar website for relevant papers. Our search results revealed that there are significant improvements in PC statistics among white men and other ethnic groups. However, its mortality rate remains significantly high among AA men. In addition, there are limited studies that have addressed the benefits of medicinal plants as chemo-preventive agents for PC treatment, especially among AA men. This review paper addresses this knowledge gap by discussing PC disparity associated with nutritional factors and highlighting the biomedical significance of three medicinal plants (curcumin, garlic, and Vernonia amygdalina) that show a great potential to prevent/treat PC, as well as to reduce its incidence/prevalence and mortality, improve survival rate, and reduce PC-related health disparity.",Signal Transduction across the Nuclear Envelope: Role of the LINC Complex in Bidirectional Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720758,Cells,2019 03 29,"The primary functions of the nuclear envelope are to isolate the nucleoplasm and its contents from the cytoplasm as well as maintain the spatial and structural integrity of the nucleus. The nuclear envelope also plays a role in the transfer of various molecules and signals to and from the nucleus. To reach the nucleus, an extracellular signal must be transmitted across three biological membranes: the plasma membrane, as well as the inner and outer nuclear membranes. While signal transduction across the plasma membrane is well characterized, signal transduction across the nuclear envelope, which is essential for cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression, remains poorly understood. As a physical entity, the nuclear envelope, which contains more than 100 proteins, functions as a binding scaffold for both the cytoskeleton and the nucleoskeleton, and acts in mechanotransduction by relaying extracellular signals to the nucleus. Recent results show that the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which is a conserved molecular bridge that spans the nuclear envelope and connects the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton, is also capable of transmitting information bidirectionally between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This short review discusses bidirectional signal transduction across the nuclear envelope, with a particular focus on mechanotransduction.",A Brief Report of Sexual Violence among Universities with NCAA Division I Athletic Programs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720757,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 10,"Violence against women on college campuses continues to be a pervasive public health problem with approximately one in five women experiencing sexual assault and one in nine women experiencing rape while in college. The current study examined relationship and sexual violence among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I universities. Based on previous research, Division I universities seem to report higher rates of sexual assault, but within-group differences have yet to be examined. The data include 1422 four-year private and public institutions with at least 1000 students who submitted Clery data (2014) on rape, domestic and dating violence, and stalking. Division I campuses reported significantly higher reports of violence against women compared to Division II, III, and universities with no athletic programs. There were no differences in violence reported across the three subdivisions within Division I, however, certain conferences reported significantly higher relationship and sexual violence within the football bowl and football championship subdivisions. These findings have important implications for targeting higher risk campuses, such as the Big 10, Big 12, Ivy League, Pac-12, and SEC with much needed sexual assault prevention programs.",Nasal Decolonisation of MRSA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720756,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 19,"The recent demonstration for the first time of urinary monic acid A as a clinical urinary biomarker of exposure to intra-nasal mupirocin during medication for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) offers a way of verifying adherence to the regimen. However, absence of the biomarker in some patients needs explanation, to ensure that efficient decolonisation has not been compromised by confounding circumstances, and that additional resistance to mupirocin has not unwittingly been encouraged.",The Shock Effect of Inorganic Suspended Solids in Surface Runoff on Wastewater Treatment Plant Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720755,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"Previous studies on the water quality of surface runoff often focused on the chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, phosphorus, and total suspended solid (TSS), but little is known in terms of the inorganic suspended solids (ISS). This research investigated the effects of ISS carried by surface runoff on the treatment efficiency of the pretreatment facilities and the ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solid to mixed liquor suspended solid (MLVSS/MLSS) of the activated sludge in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO) process in Chongqing city, China. The results showed that the surface runoff had a long-lasting impact on the grit removal capacity of the grit chamber, affecting the normal operation after the rainfall. In contrast, the primary sedimentation tank showed strong impact resistance with higher removal rates of COD, TSS, and ISS. Nonetheless, the primary settling tank aggravates the removal of organic carbon in sewage during rainfall, having a negative impact on subsequent biological treatment. The ISS in the surface runoff could increase the sludge concentration and decrease the MLVSS/MLSS ratio. After repeated surface runoff impact, the MLVSS/MLSS ratio in the activated sludge would drop below even 0.3, interrupting the normal operation of WWTP.",Edible Coatings Enriched with Essential Oils on Apples Impair the Survival of Bacterial Pathogens through a Simulated Gastrointestinal System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720754,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Edible coatings supplemented with essential oil components have been investigated to control spoilage microorganisms. In this study, the survival of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium on apples treated with edible coatings based on sodium alginate (2%) (ECs) and supplemented with essential oil components, namely eugenol (Eug) at 0.2% or in combination with 0.1% (v/v) of Eug and citral (Cit) at 0.15% was determined. Both bacterial pathogens were exposed on apples treated with ECs supplemented with Eug or Eug + Cit and challenged with gastrointestinal fluids and their survival was examined. Both pathogens were able to survive on the surface of 'Bravo de Esmolfe' apple. The use of ECs in fresh-cut fruits impaired the survival of both bacterial populations over 72 h at 4 °C. The exposure of the pathogens on apples with ECs supplemented with Eug and Cit and challenged with gastrointestinal fluids significantly reduced their survival. This study evidences that the use of alginate edible coating enriched with Eug or the combination of Eug and Cit can contribute to the safer consumption of minimally processed fruits."

About 15% of modern civil aircrafts are made from titanium alloys. Ti⁻6Al⁻4V, the most used titanium alloy, is widely considered a difficult-to-machine material due to short tool life, poor surface integrity, and low productivity during machining. Cryogenic machining using liquid nitrogen (LN₂) has shown promising advantages in increasing tool life and material removal rate whilst improving surface integrity. However, to date, there is no study on cutting tool geometry and its performance relationship in cryogenic machining. This paper presents the first investigation on various cutting tool geometries for cryogenic end milling of Ti⁻6Al⁻4V alloy. The investigations revealed that a 14° rake angle and a 10° primary clearance angle are the most suitable geometries for cryogenic machining. The effect of cutting speed on tool life was also studied. The analysis indicated that 110 m/min cutting speed yields the longest tool life of 91 min whilst allowing for up to 83% increased productivity when machining Ti⁻6Al⁻4V. Overall the research shows significant impact in machining performance of Ti⁻6Al⁻4V with much higher material removal rate.",The Relationship between Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Lesions and 24-Hour Rhythm Holter Findings in Patients with Cryptogenic Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720741,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 14,"Cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings of patients considered to be cryptogenic stroke may be useful in determining the clinical and prognostic significance of arrhythmias, such as atrial premature beats and atrial run attacks, that are frequently encountered in rhythm Holter analysis.

The composition and contents of bioactive compounds in the fruit can be influenced by its maturity stages. In this study, total phenol, total flavonoid, individual polyphenolic compounds, total carotenoids and antioxidant activities at four maturity stages of the fruit were determined. Polyphenolic compounds were analyzed using high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS) and HPLC. Among 18 polyphenolic compounds identified in this study, five parishin derivatives (gastrodin, parishin A, B, C, E) were positively identified for the first time in this plant. These compounds were also validated and quantified using authentic standards. Parishin A was the most abundant component, followed by chlorogenic acid, gastrodin, eriodictyol glucoside, parishin C, parishin E and parishin B. The contents of all the polyphenolic compounds were higher at the immature and premature stages than at fully mature and overmature stages, while total carotenoid was found to be higher in the mature and overmature stages. Overall antioxidant activities by three different assays (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP) decreased as maturation progressed. Antioxidant properties of the fruit extract are suggested to be attributed to the polyphenols.",Lipomatrix: A Novel Ascorbyl Palmitate-Based Lipid Matrix to Enhancing Enteric Absorption of Serenoa Repens Oil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720739,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 02 28,"The class of lipophilic compounds coming from vegetal source represents a perspective in the adjuvant treatment of several human diseases, despite their poor bioavailability in humans. These compounds are generally soluble in fats and poorly soluble in water. The major reason for the poor bioavailability of lipophilic natural compounds after oral uptake in humans is related to their reduced solubility in enteric water-based fluids, leading to an ineffective contact with absorbing epithelium. The main goal to ensure efficacy of such compounds is then creating technological conditions to deliver them into the first enteric tract as hydro-dispersible forms to maximize epithelial absorption. The present work describes and characterizes a new technological matrix (Lipomatrix, Labomar Research, Istrana, TV, Italy) based on a molten fats core in which Ascorbyl Palmitate is embedded, able to deliver lipophilic compounds in a well-dispersed and emulsified form once exposed to duodenal fluids. Authors describe and quantify Lipomatrix delivery of Serenoa repens oil through an innovative in vitro model of human gastro-enteric digestion, reporting results of its improved bioaccessibility, enteric absorption and efficacy compared with not formulated Serenoa repens oil-containing commercial products using in vitro models of human intestine and prostatic tissue.","An Innovative, Unobtrusive Approach to Investigate Smartphone Interaction in Nonaddicted Subjects Based on Wearable Sensors: A Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720738,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 14,"Background and objectives: Smartphones are playing a pivotal role in everyday life, due to the opportunity they grant in terms of simplifying communication, entertainment, education and many other daily activities. Against such positive characteristics, smartphone interaction can result, in particular cases, in dangerous smartphone addiction patterns, possibly leading to several long-term detrimental psychophysiological conditions. Therefore, this pilot aims at assessing the feasibility of using an innovative approach, based on unobtrusive wearable sensors, used for the first time in this specific topic, and psychological questionnaires, to investigate the links between stress and emotions in a group of young, nonaddicted individuals performing smartphone interaction. Materials andmethods: 17 volunteers were enrolled for the present study. The study protocol was divided into three phases, with an initial resting state (baseline) of three minutes, a smartphone interaction session (task) of the same length, and a final resting state (recovery), lasting three minutes. In the overall procedure, electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) measurements, both monitored by wearable sensors, were acquired in order to assess the functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Results: A significant decrease was seen in pNN50 during the smartphone interaction with respect to the baseline (Z = -2.675, p = 0.007), whereas the Low-to-High Frequency (LF/HF) ratio at task was somewhat correlated with phubbing behaviors (r = 0.655, p = 0.029), assessed through dedicated questionnaires. Conclusions: Taken together with the slight changes in GSR data, such results suggest the feasibility of this approach to characterize the ANS activation during smartphone interaction among young individuals. Further studies should enlarge the study population and involve smartphone-addicted subjects in order to increase the scientific and clinical relevance of such findings.",Correlation Between Composition and Electrodynamics Properties in Nanocomposites Based on Hard/Soft Ferrimagnetics with Strong Exchange Coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720737,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"In this work, Sr0.3Ba0.4Pb0.3Fe12O19/(CuFe₂O₄)x (x = 2, 3, 4, and 5) as strongly exchange-coupled nanosized ferrites were fabricated using a one-pot sol⁻gel combustion method (citrate sol-gel method). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns of the products confirmed the occurrence of pure, exchange-coupled ferrites. Frequency dependencies of the microwave characteristics (MW) were investigated using a co-axial method. The non-linear behavior of the MW with the composition transformation may be due to different degrees of Fe ion oxidation on the spinel/hexaferrite grain boundaries and strong exchange coupling during the hard and soft phases.","Cognitive Functioning in Patients with Pediatric-Onset Multiple Sclerosis, an Updated Review and Future Focus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720736,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) is relatively rare, but as technology and neuroimaging advance, an increasing number of cases are identified, and our understanding of how multiple sclerosis (MS) impacts the developing brain improves.

We also have a better understanding of how POMS impacts psychosocial functioning and functional outcomes in daily living. This paper hopes to review findings associated with cognitive and psychosocial functioning in patients with POMS, as well as explore more recent advances in the field and how they relate to cognitive and psychosocial outcomes. We also discuss the ongoing need for future studies with a focus on better understanding deficits and disease correlates, but also preventative measures and potential rehabilitation.",Design of Non-Uniform Antenna Arrays for Improved Near-Field MultiFocusing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720735,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"An extended method for Near-Field Multifocusing on antenna arrays, including the optimization of the locations for the elements of the array, is proposed. Multifocusing is gaining attention in recent years due to the growth of applications such as Internet of Things, or 5G, where a wireless link between a number of sensors and devices must be established, and energy or interference must be managed efficiently. Multifocusing requirements may be addressed by optimizing the feeding weights that must be applied to the elements of an array, but the proposed methodology also optimizes their locations, increasing the degrees of freedom by allowing a non-uniform structure for the array, leading to more efficient structures or better compliance with the specifications. Some experiments are presented to validate the method, showing that it is able to determine the weights and mesh of the array to fulfill the requirements, both obtaining an arbitrary distribution of elements or following a predefined geometric model.","Investigation of Permeation of Theophylline through Skin Using Selected Piperazine-2,5-Diones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720734,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 29,"Transdermal administration of drugs that penetrate, in this case directly into the blood circulation, has many advantages and is promising for many drugs thanks to its easy application and good patient compliance. (S)-8-Methyl-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-7,10-dione (alaptide), has been studied as a potential chemical permeation enhancer. Based on its structure, four selected piperazine-2,5-diones were synthesized by means of multi-step synthetic pathways. All the compounds were investigated on their ability to enhance the permeation of the model drug theophylline from the hydrophilic medium propylene glycol:water (1:1). In vitro experiments were performed using vertical Franz diffusion cells at constant temperature 34 ± 0.5 °C and using full-thickness pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) ear skin. Withdrawn samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC for determination of the permeated amount of theophylline. All the compounds were applied in ratio 1:10 (w/w) relative to the amount of theophylline. One hour after application, the permeated amount of theophylline from formulations with alaptide and (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-dione, was ca. 15- and 12-fold higher, respectively, than from the formulation without the tested compounds. Despite the enhancement ratio of both enhancers in a steady state was ca. 2.3, the pseudo-enhancement ratio in the time range from 1 to 3 h was 4.4. These enhancement ratios indicate that the compounds are able to enhance the permeation of agents through the skin; however, the short-term application of both compound formulations seems to be more advantageous. In addition, the screening of the cytotoxicity of all the prepared compounds was performed using three cell lines, and the compounds did not show any significant toxic effect.",A Randomized Controlled Trial on the Effects of Aerobic and Coordinative Training on Neural Correlates of Inhibitory Control in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720733,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Whereas aerobic training has found to be beneficial for inhibitory control, less is known on the efficiency of other exercise types in children. The present study compared the effects of aerobic and coordinative training on behavioral and neurophysiological measures of inhibitory control. Forty-five children were randomly assigned (1:1:1 ratio) to groups performing aerobic training, coordinative training or assisted homework sessions over 10 weeks. Before and after intervention, all participants completed a Flanker task. The P300 component of event-related potentials elicited from the task was recorded via electroencephalography. Additionally, aerobic fitness and gross-motor skills were assessed using 20 m Shuttle Run and Heidelberg Gross-Motor Test, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed no time by group interactions for the P300 component (amplitude, latency), p = 0.976, η² = 0.007, and behavioral performance (reaction time, accuracy), p = 0.570, η² = 0.045. In contrast, there was a significant group-difference in pre- to post-test changes in aerobic fitness, p = 0.008, η² = 0.246, with greater improvements following aerobic and coordinative training compared to assisted homework sessions. In conclusion, no differences regarding the efficiency of aerobic and coordinative training for the enhancement of inhibitory control were found as both exercise programs failed to elicit changes in speed and accuracy of stimulus evaluation and the allocation of attentional resources."

The aim of this work was to analyze the O₂ and CO₂ concentrations within the internal atmosphere of the packaging. In this study, dried apricots and raisins were packaged in glass jars and polypropylene trays thermosealed with different polymers, and stored at 5, 15, 25, and 35 °C. Some trays were flushed with nitrogen just before sealing. In addition, the work relates to other previous papers to investigate the effect of these gases and packages on the stored products, and compares the influence of permeable and impermeable containers on food quality parameters. When packages were flushed with nitrogen before sealing, the O₂ level in the headspace increased until the outside O₂ concentration was reached. The CO₂ concentration increased over time, regardless of the initial atmosphere. Nitrogen had a great influence on the concentration of O₂, but not on that of CO₂. Finally, this paper shows that the films and initial gas used in this study had no significant effect on the quality of the stored dried fruit.",Immunogenicity and Immune Memory after a Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine Booster in a High-Risk Population Primed with 10-Valent or 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Papua New Guinean Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720721,Vaccines,2019 04 19,"We investigated the immunogenicity, seroprotection rates and persistence of immune memory in young children at high risk of pneumococcal disease in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Children were primed with 10-valent (PCV10) or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13) at 1, 2 and 3 months of age and randomized at 9 months to receive PPV (PCV10/PPV-vaccinated, n = 51; PCV13/PPV-vaccinated, n = 52) or no PPV (PCV10/PPV-naive, n = 57; PCV13/PPV-naive, n = 48). All children received a micro-dose of PPV at 23 months of age to study the capacity to respond to a pneumococcal challenge. PPV vaccination resulted in significantly increased IgG responses (1.4 to 10.5-fold change) at 10 months of age for all PPV-serotypes tested. Both PPV-vaccinated and PPV-naive children responded to the 23-month challenge and post-challenge seroprotection rates (IgG ≥ 0.35 μg/mL) were similar in the two groups (80⁻100% for 12 of 14 tested vaccine serotypes). These findings show that PPV is immunogenic in 9-month-old children at high risk of pneumococcal infections and does not affect the capacity to produce protective immune responses. Priming with currently available PCVs followed by a PPV booster in later infancy could offer improved protection to young children at high risk of severe pneumococcal infections caused by a broad range of serotypes.",New Anti-inflammatory Flavonol Glycosides from Lindera akoensis Hayata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720720,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 29,"Inflammation is related to many diseases.

This will affect consumers' first impression and the service life of the car itself. In most worldwide automobile industries, the inspection process is mainly performed by human vision, which is unstable and insufficient. The combination of artificial intelligence and the automobile industry shows promise nowadays. However, it is a challenge to inspect such defects in a computer system because of imbalanced illumination, specular highlight reflection, various reflection modes and limited defect features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel automatic inspection system (AIS) for automobile surface defects which are the located in or close to style lines, edges and handles. The system consists of image acquisition and image processing devices, operating in a closed environment and noncontact way with four LED light sources. Specifically, we use five plane-array Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras to collect images of the five sides of the automobile synchronously. Then the AIS extracts candidate defect regions from the vehicle body image by a multi-scale Hessian matrix fusion method. Finally, candidate defect regions are classified into pseudo-defects, dents and scratches by feature extraction (shape, size, statistics and divergence features) and a support vector machine algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that automatic inspection system can effectively reduce false detection of pseudo-defects produced by image noise and achieve accuracies of 95.6% in dent defects and 97.1% in scratch defects, which is suitable for customs inspection of imported vehicles.",The Proliferative and Apoptotic Landscape of Basal-like Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720718,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 02 28,"Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive molecular subtype that represents up to 15% of breast cancers. It occurs in younger patients, and typically shows rapid development of locoregional and distant metastasis, resulting in a relatively high mortality rate. Its defining features are that it is positive for basal cytokeratins and, epidermal growth factor receptor and/or c-Kit. Problematically, it is typically negative for the estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which means that it is unsuitable for either hormone therapy or targeted HER2 therapy. As a result, there are few therapeutic options for BLBC, and a major priority is to define molecular subgroups of BLBC that could be targeted therapeutically. In this review, we focus on the highly proliferative and anti-apoptotic phenotype of BLBC with the goal of defining potential therapeutic avenues, which could take advantage of these aspects of tumor development.",Potential of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. in Human Health and Nutrition: A Review of Current Knowledge and Therapeutic Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720717,Nutrients,2019 04 01,"Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (SCE) is a plant with high potential for beneficial health effects, confirmed by molecular studies. Its constituents exert anti-cancer effects through the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as well as inhibition of invasion and metastasis in cancer cell lines and experimental animals. SCE displays antimicrobial effects against several pathogenic strains. It has anti-diabetic potential, supported by hypoglycemic activity. A diet rich in SCE improves pancreatic functions, stimulates insulin secretion, and reduces complications in diabetic animals. SCE prevents lipid accumulation and differentiation of preadipocytes, indicating its anti-obesity potential. SCE exerts a protective effect against skin photoaging, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and improves physical endurance and cognitive/behavioural functions, which can be linked with its general anti-aging potency. In food technology, SCE is applied as a preservative, and as an additive to increase the flavour, taste, and nutritional value of food. In summary, SCE displays a variety of beneficial health effects, with no side effects. Further research is needed to determine the molecular mechanisms of SCE action. First, the constituents responsible for its beneficial effects should be isolated and identified, and recommended as preventative nutritional additives, or considered as therapeutics.",Synergistic Effect of Marble Powder and Green Sand on the Mechanical Properties of Metakaolin-Cement Concrete.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720716,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,The aim of this paper is to study experimentally the effect of marble powder and green sand as partial substitute for fine aggregate on the strength and durability of M40 grade concrete. The use of metakaolin as a pozzolanic admixture by using as binder replacement is also studied to assess the properties with respect to fresh and hardened state. Several formulations were prepared with constant water-binder ratio 0.4 and varying percentages of marble powder and green sand. The results indicated that the properties of concrete were much enhanced by extent incorporation of marble powder and green sand as fine aggregate and metakaolin for cement when compared to normal concrete. The microscopic studies also confirmed the viability of using green sand and marble powder as fine aggregates.,Improvement of ZrC/Zr Coating on the Interface Combination and Physical Properties of Diamond-Copper Composites Fabricated by Spark Plasma Sintering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720715,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"In this study, diamond-copper composites were prepared with ZrC/Zr-coated diamond powders by spark plasma sintering. The magnetron sputtering technique was employed to coat the diamond particles with a zirconium layer. After heat treatment, most of the zirconium reacted with the surface of diamond and was transformed into zirconium carbide. The remaining zirconium on the zirconium carbide surface formed the outer layer. Owing to the method used to produce the ZrC/Zr-coated diamond in this study, the maximum thermal conductivity (TC) of 609 W·m-1·K-1 was obtained for 60 vol. % diamond-copper composites and the corresponding coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) reached as low as 6.75 × 10-6 K-1. The bending strength of 40 vol. % ZrC/Zr-coated diamond-copper composites reached 255.95 MPa. The thermal and mechanical properties of ZrC/Zr-coated diamond-copper composites were substantially superior to those of uncoated diamond particles. Excellent properties can be attributed to the strengthening of the interfacial combination and the decrease in the interfacial thermal resistance due to the improvement associated with the ZrC/Zr coating. Theoretical analysis was also proposed to compare the thermal conductivities and CTE of diamond-copper composites fabricated with these two kinds of diamond powders.",Electrical and Thermal Transport Properties of Layered Superconducting Ca10(Pt₄As8)((Fe0.86Pt0.14)2As₂)₅ Single Crystal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720714,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"We have synthesized single crystals of iron-based superconducting Ca10(Pt₄As₈)((Fe0.86Pt0.14)₂As₂)₅ and performed extensive measurements on their transport properties. A remarkable difference in the behavior and a large anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity was observed. Disorder could explain the in-plane square-root temperature dependence resistivity, and interlayer incoherent scattering may contribute to the out-of-plane transport property. Along the ab plane, the estimated value of the coherence length is 15.5 Å. From measurements of the upper critical magnetic field Hc2 (T ≥ 20 K), we estimate Hc2(0) = 313 T. Thermal conductivity for Ca10(Pt₄As₈)((Fe0.86Pt0.14)₂As₂)₅ is relatively small, which can be accounted for by the disorder in the crystal and the low-charge carrier density as verified by the Hall effect.",An Overview of Parameters Controlling the Decomposition and Degradation of Ti-Based Mn+1AXn Phases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720713,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"A critical overview of the various parameters, such as annealing atmospheres, pore microstructures, and pore sizes, that are critical in controlling the decomposition kinetics of Ti-based MAX phases is given in this paper. Ti-based MAX phases tend to decompose readily above 1400 °C during vacuum annealing to binary carbide (e.g. TiCx) or binary nitride (e.g. TiNx), primarily through the sublimation of A elements such as Al or Si, forming in a porous MXx surface layer. Arrhenius Avrami equations were used to determine the activation energy of phase decomposition and to model the kinetics of isothermal phase decomposition. Ironically, the understanding of phase decomposition via exfoliating or selective de-intercalation by chemical etching formed the catalyst for the sensational discovery of Mxenes in 2011. Other controlling parameters that also promote decomposition or degradation as reported in the literature are also briefly reviewed and these include effects of pressure and ion irradiations."

The co-occurrence of the disorders is so common that it challenges our notions of the meaning of comorbidity and our desire to neatly separate psychiatric and medical illnesses. The overlap between symptoms of physical illness and the neurovegetative symptoms of major depression and the initial normative emotional response to physical illness add to the challenge of accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of depression in the medically ill. We review the literature on the comorbidity of depression and the various medical illnesses, including diagnostic and treatment approaches. The differential diagnosis for major depression among medically ill patients should include delirium and medication-induced symptoms. We suggest that major depression itself may be best conceptualized as a systemic illness whose pathophysiology overlaps with other systemic medical illnesses. The initial treatment strategies for major depression in medical illness are like those for the general population; however, the comorbid medical illnesses may interfere with remission. To illustrate these points, we describe a patient with clinical characteristics covered in this review who experienced major depression as well as several chronic illnesses, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain due to degenerative joint disease, and diabetes mellitus.",The Effects of Dietary Improvement on Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720698,Psychosomatic medicine,2019 05 02,"Poor diet can be detrimental to mental health.

Between December 1996 and May 2017, 175 patients underwent an elective splenectomy. A laparoscopic approach was used in 133 (76%) patients. Massive spleens were treated in 65 (37.1%) patients, of which 24 were treated laparoscopically. In this subset of massive spleens, the results of laparoscopic splenectomy in massive spleens (LSM) and open splenectomy in massive spleens (OSM) were compared. The clinical outcome of a subgroup of patients with giant spleens was also analyzed. The LSM group resulted in significant longer operative times (143±31 vs. 112±40 min; P=0.001), less blood loss (278±302 vs. 575±583 mL; P=0.007), and shorter hospital stay (6±3 vs. 9±4 d; P=0.004). No conversions were experienced in the LSM group, and the morbidity rate was similar in both the LSM and OSM groups (16.6% vs. 20%; P=0.75). When considering the subset of 9 LSM patients and 26 OSM patients with giant spleens, the same favorable tendency of the laparoscopic group as regards surgical conversion, blood loss, and hospital stay was maintained.

Five Tc-Nanocis were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and five others were realized without any heating step. Quality controls were performed for each preparation. To evaluate the effect of heating on particle size, preparations were filtered through a 0.22 µm sterilizing membrane filter before and after 30 min of heating. The radioactivity was measured before and after the filtration. The results showed that absence of heating does not influence the apparent RCP of Tc-nanocolloid of rhenium sulphide.

Our previous findings show that CD8 T cells are necessary for the resolution of paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia in male mice. In this study, we demonstrate that CD8 T cells are not only essential for resolving cisplatin-induced mechanical allodynia, but also to normalize spontaneous pain, numbness, and the reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density in male and female mice. Resolution of CIPN was not observed in Rag2 mice that lack T and B cells. Reconstitution of Rag2 mice with CD8 T cells before cisplatin treatment normalized the resolution of CIPN. In vivo education of CD8 T cells by cisplatin was necessary to induce resolution of CIPN in Rag2 mice because adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells from naive wild-type mice to Rag2 mice after completion of chemotherapy did not promote resolution of established CIPN. The CD8 T-cell-dependent resolution of CIPN does not require epitope recognition by the T-cell receptor. Moreover, adoptive transfer of cisplatin-educated CD8 T cells to Rag2 mice prevented CIPN development induced by either cisplatin or paclitaxel, indicating that the activity of the educated CD8 T is not cisplatin specific. In conclusion, resolution of CIPN requires in vivo education of CD8 T cells by exposure to cisplatin. Future studies should examine whether ex vivo CD8 T cell education could be applied as a therapeutic strategy for treating or preventing CIPN in patients.",α5GABAA receptors play a pro-nociceptive role and avoid the rate dependent depression of the Hoffmann reflex in diabetic neuropathic pain and reduce primary afferent excitability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720584,Pain,2019 02 05,"Diabetic neuropathy is an incapacitating complication in diabetic patients. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this pathology are poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that the loss of spinal GABAergic inhibition participate in painful diabetic neuropathy. However, the role of extrasynaptic α5 subunit-containing GABAA (α5GABAA) receptors in this process is not known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of α5GABAA receptors in diabetes-induced tactile allodynia, loss of rate dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann reflex (HR) and modulation of primary afferent excitability. Intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (STZ) induced tactile allodynia. Intrathecal injection of α5GABAA receptor inverse agonist, L-655,708, produced tactile allodynia in naïve rats whereas it reduced allodynia in diabetic rats. In healthy rats, electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve at 5 Hz induced RDD of the HR, although intrathecal treatment with L-655,708 (15 nmol) abolished RDD of the HR. STZ induced the loss of RDD of the HR, while intrathecal L-655,708 (15 nmol) restored RDD of the HR. L-655,708 (15 nmol) increased tonic excitability of the primary afferents without affecting the phasic excitability produced by the primary afferent depolarization. α5GABAA receptors were immunolocalized in superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and L4-L6 DRG. STZ increased mean fluorescence intensity and percentage of neurons expressing α5GABAA receptors in dorsal horn and L4-L6 DRGs in ten-weeks diabetic rats. Our results suggest that spinal α5GABAA receptors modulate the HR, play an antinociceptive and pronociceptive role in healthy and diabetic rats, respectively and are tonically active in primary afferents.",Multicolumn spinal cord stimulation for predominant back pain in failed back surgery syndrome patients: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720582,Pain,2019 05 20,"Despite optimal medical management (OMM), low back pain (LBP) can be disabling, particularly after spinal surgery. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is effective in reducing neuropathic leg pain; however, evidence is limited for LBP. This prospective, open-label, parallel-group trial randomized (1:1) failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients with predominant LBP to SCS plus OMM (SCS group) or OMM alone (OMM group) at 28 sites in Europe and the Americas. If trial stimulation was successful, a multicolumn SCS system was implanted. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (before randomization) and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. Patients could change treatment groups at 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in LBP (responder) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included change in pain intensity, functional disability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The results are posted at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01697358. In the intent-to-treat analysis, there were more responders in the SCS group than in the OMM group (13.6%, 15/110 vs 4.6%, 5/108, difference 9% with 95% confidence interval 0.6%-17.5%, P = 0.036) at 6 months. The SCS group improved in all secondary outcomes compared with the OMM group. The OMM group only improved in HRQoL. In the SCS group, 17.6% (18/102) experienced SCS-related adverse events through 6 months, with 11.8% (12/102) requiring surgical reintervention. Adding multicolumn SCS to OMM improved pain relief, HRQoL, and function in a traditionally difficult-to-treat population of failed back surgery syndrome patients with predominant LBP. Improvements were sustained at 12 and 24 months.",Nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor modulates painful and fatigue symptoms in a mouse model of fibromyalgia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720581,Pain,2019 05 20,"Generalized pain and fatigue are both hallmarks of fibromyalgia, a syndrome with an indefinite etiology. The treatment options for fibromyalgia are currently limited, probably because of its intricate pathophysiology. Thus, further basic and clinical research on this condition is currently needed. This study investigated the effects of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor (NOPr) ligands and the modulation of the NOP system in the preclinical mouse model of reserpine-induced fibromyalgia. The effects of administration of the natural agonist N/OFQ and the selective NOPr antagonists (UFP-101 and SB-612111) were evaluated in fibromyalgia-related symptoms in reserpine-treated mice. The expression of prepronociceptin/orphanin FQ and NOPr was assessed in central and peripheral sites at different time points after reserpine administration. Nociceptin/orphanin FQ displayed dual effects in the behavioral changes in the reserpine-elicited fibromyalgia model. The peptide NOPr antagonist UFP-101 produced analgesic and antifatigue effects, by preventing alterations in brain activity and skeletal muscle metabolism, secondary to fibromyalgia induction. The nonpeptide NOPr antagonist SB-612111 mirrored the favorable effects of UFP-101 in painful and fatigue alterations induced by reserpine. A time-related up- or downregulation of prepronociceptin/orphanin FQ and NOPr was observed in supraspinal, spinal, and peripheral sites of reserpine-treated mice. Our data shed new lights on the mechanisms underlying the fibromyalgia pathogenesis, supporting a role for N/OFQ-NOP receptor system in this syndrome.",The role of Nav1.7 in human nociceptors: insights from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons of erythromelalgia patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720580,Pain,2019 05 20,"The chronic pain syndrome inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) is attributed to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) 1.7. Still, recent studies targeting NaV1.7 in clinical trials have provided conflicting results. Here, we differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells from IEM patients with the NaV1.7/I848T mutation into sensory nociceptors. Action potentials in these IEM nociceptors displayed a decreased firing threshold, an enhanced upstroke, and afterhyperpolarization, all of which may explain the increased pain experienced by patients. Subsequently, we investigated the voltage dependence of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV activation in these human sensory neurons using a specific prepulse voltage protocol. The IEM mutation induced a hyperpolarizing shift of NaV activation, which leads to activation of NaV1.7 at more negative potentials. Our results indicate that NaV1.7 is not active during subthreshold depolarizations, but that its activity defines the action potential threshold and contributes significantly to the action potential upstroke. Thus, our model system with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons provides a new rationale for NaV1.7 function and promises to be valuable as a translational tool to profile and develop more efficacious clinical analgesics."

The technique's development has not stopped, many authors have modified it to achieve better outcomes for both traumatic and congenital hand defects. The most commonly used toes for transplantation are first, second, and second to third toe block. Well described plantar and dorsal vascular systems for first web space vessels as well as possibility to perform successful perforator anastomosis allows us to improve toe-to-hand transplantation further. There is a paucity of studies on single fourth toe-to-hand transplantation. We performed fourth-toe transplantation for three pediatric patients (mean age, 73 mo) with congenital (n=2) and traumatic (n=1) hand defects. Common plantar digital arteries were used for blood supply to the transplanted toes. No vascular problems occurred, and all transplanted toes survived.

One of the major systemic effects leading to lethality of radiation includes its suppressive effect on hematopoiesis, which could be observed even at doses as low as 1-2 Gy, whereas effects on gastrointestinal and nervous systems appear at relatively higher doses in the same order. This article reviews the effects of radiation on the three distinct stages of erythropoiesis-formation of erythroid progenitor cells, differentiation of erythroid precursor cells, and terminal maturation. During these stepwise developmental processes, erythroid progenitor cells undergo rapid expansion to form terminally differentiated red blood cells that are continuously replenished from bone marrow into the circulating peripheral blood stream. Cellular radiation response depends upon many factors such as cell lineage, rate of proliferation, and differentiation status. Therefore, we discuss radiation-induced alterations during the progenitor, precursor, and terminal maturation stages and the implications thereof. Since biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in human populations are of great interest for assessing normal tissue injury as well as for biodosimetry in the event of accidental or incidental radiation exposures, we also highlight blood-based biomarkers that have potential utility for medical management.",Neurotoxicity of general anesthetics in children: evidence and uncertainties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720543,Current opinion in pediatrics,2019 03 07,"Compelling evidence in animal models that, under some conditions, general anesthetics and sedatives produce changes in the brain and persistent impairments in learning, memory, and behavior.

The methyl group influenced the overall crystal packing even if the H atoms of the methyl group did not participate directly either in hydrogen bonding or C-H...π interactions. The introduction of the methoxy moiety caused the formation of new hydrogen bonds, in which the O atom of the methoxy group was directly involved.

All six compounds exhibit an infinite one-dimensional ladder in the solid state governed by the formation of hydrogen-bonding and π-π stacking interactions. The crystal structures of these compounds were studied using geometrical and Hirshfeld surface analyses. They have also been studied using M06-2X/def2-TZVP calculations and Bader's theory of `atoms in molecules'. The energies associated with the interactions, including the contribution of the different forces, have been evaluated. In general, the π-π stacking interactions are stronger than those reported for conventional π-π complexes, which is attributed to the influence of the metal coordination, which is stronger for Zn than either Cd or Hg.

Single-crystal structure analysis shows that the CdII atom in MOF (1) has a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal [CdN2O5] coordination geometry. The [CdN2O5] units as 4-connected nodes are interconnected by L- ligands to form a fourfold interpenetrating three-dimensional (3D) framework with a dia topology. In MOF (2), there are two crystallographically different CdII ions showing a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal [CdNO6] and a distorted octahedral [CdN2O4] coordination geometry, respectively. Two CdII ions are connected by three carboxylate groups to form a binuclear [Cd2(COO)3] cluster.

MOF (3) contains two crystallographically distinct NiII ions on special positions. Each NiII ion adopts an elongated octahedral [NiN2O4] geometry. Each NiII ion as a 4-connected node is linked by L- ligands to generate a two-dimensional network with an sql topology, which is further stabilized by two types of intermolecular OW-HW...O hydrogen bonds to form a 3D supramolecular framework. MOFs (1)-(3) were also characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetic analysis. Furthermore, the solid-state photoluminescence of HL and MOFs (1) and (2) have been investigated. The photoluminescence of MOFs (1) and (2) are enhanced and red-shifted with respect to free HL. The gas adsorption investigation of MOF (2) indicates a good separation selectivity (71) of CO2/N2 at 273 K (i.e. the amount of CO2 adsorption is 71 times higher than N2 at the same pressure).","Synthesis, structure and selective luminescence sensing for iron(III) ions of a three-dimensional zinc(II) (4,6)-connected coordination network.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720452,"Acta crystallographica.

However, recent clinical trials to elevate serum HDL levels by pharmacologic approaches failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Thus, to investigate the functionality of HDL and to explore the possible clinical relevance as well as to define an effective indicator that can represent HDL function may provide another key and reference to disclose the clinical treatment of dyslipidemia. We analyzed the association between the data of dichlorofluorescein assay (assay the functionality of HDL), the effect of HDL on oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro, levels of circulating EPCs, and ex vitro EPC colony forming units of each case, we defined the indicator (relative HDL index (RHDL index) = dichlorofluorescein assay result of each subject/dichlorofluorescein assay reading of our young healthy controls) that may represent functionality of HDL.

Critiques have rightfully challenged both claims, stressing how the first may lead to problematic forms of reductionism whereas the second relies on debatable assumptions about the nature of bioethics specialization and development. Informed by philosophical pragmatism and our experience in neuroethics, we argue that these claims are ill founded and should give way to pragmatist reconstructions; namely, that neuroscience, much like other areas of empirical research on morality, can provide useful information about the nature of morally problematic situations, but does not need to promise radical and sweeping changes to ethics based on neuroscientism. Furthermore, the rationale for the development of neuroethics as a specialized field need not to be premised on the distinctive nature of the issues it tackles or of neurotechnologies.

We also found that estimates of host Ne and parasite Ne were sensitive to assumptions about population genetic structure and connectivity. And, while prior work on the stickleback-cestode system indicates that physiographic factors external to stickleback hosts largely govern genetic variation in S. solidus, our findings indicate that stickleback host attributes and factors internal to the host - namely body length, genetic diversity and infection - shape contemporary Ne of cestode parasites.",Apparent Diffusion Coefficient as an Imaging Biomarker for Spinal Disease Activity in Axial Spondyloarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720403,Radiology,2019 03 21,"Background A quantifiable imaging measure to gauge the intensity of individual inflammatory lesions in axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) has not been well established.

Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 243 study participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 43.2 years ± 13.5) with back pain who fulfilled the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria for SpA were recruited from four rheumatology centers between April 2014 and March 2018. There were 132 men (mean age, 41.4 years ± 13.3) and 111 women (mean age, 45.3 years ± 13.4). Clinical, biochemical, and radiologic parameters were collected. All participants underwent whole-spine MRI by using a short inversion time inversion-recovery sequence and DW imaging. Two independent readers identified the presence of discovertebral lesions. ADCs were measured and normalized with normal bone marrow. Regression analysis was performed to determine association between the mean, maximum, and normalized mean and maximum ADCs of the discovertebral lesions and disease activity and functional parameters (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI], Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global Index [BASGI]). Results Ninety-one discovertebral lesions (five cervical, 61 thoracic, 25 lumbar) were present in 55 of the 243 study participants (22.6%). After adjusting for confounding factors, increased maximum ADC was independently associated with increased BASFI (regression coefficient [β] = 1.94 [×10-3 mm2/sec], P = .04). Increased normalized maximum ADC was independently associated with BASDAI question 2 (ie, back pain score) (β = 0.45, P = .01), mean stiffness score (β = 0.41, P = .04), and BASGI (β = 0.43, P = .04). Increased normalized mean ADC was independently associated with BASDAI question 2 (β = 0.61, P = .04). Conclusion Apparent diffusion coefficients at MRI of discovertebral lesions were associated with disease activity, functional impairment, and patient global assessment in axial spondyloarthritis. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

However, only short-term follow-up after CT-guided microcoil localization and lung resection has been previously reported. Purpose To assess the diagnostic utility and recurrence-free survival over a minimum of 2 years following CT-guided microcoil localization and VATS. Materials and Methods Among 1950 VATS procedures performed in a single tertiary institution from October 2008 through April 2016, 124 consecutive patients with CT-guided microcoil localization were retrospectively evaluated. Patient demographics, nodule characteristics, and histopathologic findings were recorded. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival after 2 or more years of CT surveillance. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression. Results In 124 patients (men, 35%; mean age, 65 years ± 12) with a nodule found at CT, microcoil localization and VATS resection were performed for a total of 126 nodules (mean size, 13 mm ± 6; mean distance to pleura, 20 mm ± 9). On presurgical CT evaluation, 42% (53 of 126) of nodules were solid, 33% (41 of 126) were ground glass, and 24% (30 of 126) were subsolid. VATS excisional biopsy altered cytopathologic diagnosis in 21% (five of 24) of patients with prior diagnostic premicrocoil CT-guided biopsy. At histopathologic examination, 17% (21 of 126) of the nodules were adenocarcinoma in situ, 17% (22 of 126) were minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, 30% (38 of 126) were invasive lung primary tumors, and 22% (28 of 126) were metastases. Among the 72 patients with malignancy at histopathologic examination and at least 2 years of CT surveillance, local recurrence occurred in 7% (five of 72), intrathoracic recurrence in 22% (16 of 72), and extrathoracic recurrence in 18% (13 of 72) after 2 or more years of CT surveillance. There was no recurrence for adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, or invasive lung tumors measuring less than 1 cm. After multivariable adjustment, nodule location at a distance greater than 10 mm from the pleura was an independent predictor of time to recurrence (hazard ratio, 2.9 [95% confidence interval: 1.1, 7.4]; P = .03). Conclusion CT-guided microcoil localization and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection alter clinical management and were associated with excellent recurrence-free survival for superficial premalignant, minimally invasive, and small invasive lung tumors. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Radiologic Findings in Intimate Partner Violence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720401,Radiology,2019 03 21,"Purpose To assess the radiologic findings associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). Materials and Methods Electronic medical records of 185 patients referred to the IPV support program from the emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 555 subjects (1:3 ratio of IPV victims to control subjects) who presented to the ED. Reports of all imaging studies performed within 5 years prior to the index ED visit were reviewed. Results The majority of patients who experienced IPV (mean age, 34.2 years ± 12.2 [standard deviation]) were female (178 of 185 [96.2%]) and were largely African American (69 of 185 [37.3%]). Demographic and clinical variables independently associated with IPV were race (odds ratio [OR] range, 3.2-5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8, 12.7), psychiatric comorbidities (OR, 5.4; 95% CI: 3.4, 8.8), and homelessness (OR, 13.0; 95% CI: 5.4, 31.2). IPV victims underwent more imaging studies in the preceding 5 years (median, four studies) than did control subjects (median, one study). Obstetric-gynecologic findings (OR, 4.4; 95% CI: 2.1, 9.6) and acute fractures (OR, 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.3) seen on images were independently associated with IPV. The addition of imaging findings to demographic and clinical variables increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the multivariate model to detect IPV (0.87 vs 0.86, P < .01), and the cross-validated multivariate model had an AUC of 0.85. Acute fractures involved the face or skull (range, P < .01 to P = .05), and chronic fractures affected the extremities and nasal bone (P < .01 and P = .05, respectively) more frequently in the IPV group than in the control group. Conclusion Intimate partner violence victims undergo more imaging studies and have a higher frequency of potential violence-related imaging findings when compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects. © RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Flores and Narayan in this issue.",Automated Calculation of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score: Feasibility and Reliability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720400,Radiology,2019 03 21,"Background The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) evaluation is a qualitative method to evaluate focal hypoattenuation at brain CT in early acute stroke. However, interobserver agreement is only moderate. Purpose To compare ASPECTS calculated by using an automatic software tool to neuroradiologist evaluation in the setting of acute stroke. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study, consensus ASPECTS were defined by two neuroradiologists based on baseline noncontrast CTs collected from January 2017 to December 2017 from patients with an occlusion in the middle cerebral artery and from an additional cohort of patients suspected of having stroke and no large vessel occlusion. Imaging data from both baseline and follow-up CT was evaluated for the consensus reading. After 6 weeks, the same two neuroradiologists again determined ASPECTS by using only the baseline CT. For comparison, ASPECTS was also calculated from baseline CT images by using a commercially available software (RAPID ASPECTS). Both methods were compared by using weighted κ statistics. Results CT scans from 100 patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion (44 women [mean age ± standard deviation, 75 years ± 14] and 56 men [mean age, 71 years ± 14]) and 52 patients suspected of having stroke and no large vessel occlusion (19 women [mean age, 69 years ± 18] and 33 men [68 years ± 15]) were evaluated. Neuroradiologists showed moderate agreement with the consensus score (κ = 0.57 and κ = 0.56). Software analysis showed substantial agreement (κ = 0.9) with the consensus score. Software analysis showed a substantial agreement (κ = 0.78) after greater than 1 hour between symptom onset and imaging, which increased to high agreement (κ = 0.92) in the time window greater than 4 hours. The neuroradiologist raters did not achieve comparable results to the software until the time interval of greater than 4 hours (κ = 0.83 and κ = 0.76). Conclusion In acute stroke of the middle cerebral artery, the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score calculated with automated software had better agreement than that of human readers with a predefined consensus score. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

Aim:
 To understand age- and gender-related differences and secular trends in coronary artery disease (CAD) lipid profiles and the characteristic of dyslipidemia in western China. 
Methods:
 An age-matched case-control study, including 2400 patients and 1200 controls was performed. All blood lipid tests evaluated from January 2012 to January 2015 at First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were analyzed. Details of the gender and age of the patients were available. Trends were calculated using linear regression and Mantel-Haenszel X2 analyses. 
Results:
 We determined the associations among total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1), apolipoprotein B (apoB), nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with CAD for different ages and gender. Except for patients who were <40 years old, the plasma levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apoB, and apoB/apoA-1 were higher in the cases than in controls, and the average levels of these markers decreased significantly as age increased. In contrast, the levels of apoA-1 and HDL-C were significantly higher in the controls than in the patients, and the levels of these markers significantly increased as age increased. Women had higher levels of TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB and a higher value of the apoB/apoA-1 ratio compared to men. The decrease in the average levels of these markers with age was significantly lower in women compared to men. Logistic regression was used to compute the odds ratio of CAD for a one standard deviation change in each lipid marker. Most notably, the apoB/apoA-1 ratio could be a strong risk factor for CAD, and increasing values of the ratio showed a curved line for the graph of the relationship between the ratio and risk. 
Conclusions:
 Our results confirmed that serum lipid levels in patients with CAD varied by age and gender. The apoB/apoA-1 ratio remains a strong risk factor for CAD.",Role of technology in improving knowledge and confidence in asthma management in school staff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720382,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,2019 02 05,To investigate the effectiveness of technology enabled learning in improving asthma first aid knowledge and self-confidence in providing asthma first aid to children in staff within a school setting.,Prevalence of symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children in Southern Brazil: a ten-year monitoring study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720381,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,2019 02 05,"This study analyzes and describes trends in prevalence of asthma and rhinitis in children 6-7 years old living in Santo Ângelo, Brazil, by comparing data from 2007, 2012, and 2017.",Treatment of shoulder pathologies based on irritability: a case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720380,Physiotherapy theory and practice,2019 02 05,Case Series.,Effect of prenatal counseling on exclusive breastfeeding frequency and infant weight gain in mothers with previous unsuccessful breastfeeding: a randomized controlled clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720379,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 02 18,Breastfeeding counseling and mother support provision positively affect the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and infant growth and development.

Thus our goal is to formulate a liquid formulation of poorly-water soluble anticoagulant, rivaroxaban (RIVA), for paediatric use and to assess the possibility of its intravenous administration in emergencies. Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDSs) were developed and characterized. SNEDDS constituents were estimated from the saturated solubility study followed by plotting the corresponding ternary phase diagrams to determine the best self-emulsified systems. Thermodynamic stability, emulsification, dispersibility, robustness to dilution tests, in vitro dissolution, particle size, and zeta potential were executed to optimize the formulations. The optimized formulation, that composed of Capryol 90:Tween 20:PEG 300 (5:45:50), increased RIVA solubility (285.7-fold than water), it formed nanoemulsion with a particle size of 16.15 nm, PDI of 0.25 and zeta potential of -21.8. It released 100.83 ± 2.78% of RIVA after 5 min. SNEDDS was robust to dilution with oral and parenteral fluids and showed safety to human RBCs.

Background:
 Patients with cancer and palliative care needs frequently use the emergency department (ED). ED-based palliative services may extend the reach of palliative care for these patients. 
Objective:
 To assess the feasibility and reach of an ED-based palliative intervention (EPI) program. 
Design:
 A cross-sectional descriptive study of ED patients with active cancer from January 2017 to August 2017. 
Subjects:
 Patients with palliative care needs were identified using an abbreviated 5-question version of the screen for palliative and end-of-life care needs in the ED (5-SPEED). Patients with palliative care needs were then automatically flagged for an EPI as determined by their identified need. 
Measurements:
 The primary outcome was the prevalence of palliative care needs among patients with active cancer. Secondary outcomes were the rate of EPI services successfully delivered to ED patients with unmet palliative care needs, ED length of stay (LOS), and repeat ED visits within the next 10 days. Categorical variables were evaluated using chi-squared or Fischer's exact test as appropriate. Continuous variables were evaluated using analysis of variance. 
Results:
 Of the 1278 patients with active cancer, 817 (63.9%) completed the 5-SPEED screen. Of the patients who completed the screen, 422 patients (51.7%) had one or more unmet palliative care needs and 167 (39.6%) received an EPI. There were no differences in ED LOS or 10-day repeat ED visit rates between patients who did or did not receive an EPI. 
Conclusion:
 This ED-based intervention successfully screened for palliative needs in cancer patients and improved access to specific palliative services without increasing ED LOS."

Yet little is known about how increased temperature will impact the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship. We tackled this subject theoretically and experimentally. We developed a BEF theory based on mechanistic population dynamic models, which allows the inclusion of the effect of temperature. Using experimentally established relationships between attack rate and temperature, the model predicts that temperature increase will intensify competition, and consequently the BEF relationship will flatten or even become negative. We conducted a laboratory experiment with natural microbial microcosms, and the results were in agreement with the model predictions. The experimental results also revealed that an increase in both temperature average and variation had a more intense effect than an increase in temperature average alone. Our results indicate that under climate change, high diversity may not guarantee high ecosystem functioning.",Animal Coloration Patterns: Linking Spatial Vision to Quantitative Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720360,The American naturalist,2019 02 05,"Animal coloration patterns, from zebra stripes to bird egg speckles, are remarkably varied. With research on the perception, function, and evolution of animal patterns growing rapidly, we require a convenient framework for quantifying their diversity, particularly in the contexts of camouflage, mimicry, mate choice, and individual recognition. Ideally, patterns should be defined by their locations in a low-dimensional pattern space that represents their appearance to their natural receivers, much as color is represented by color spaces. This synthesis explores the extent to which animal patterns, like colors, can be described by a few perceptual dimensions in a pattern space. We begin by reviewing biological spatial vision, focusing on early stages during which neurons act as spatial filters or detect simple features such as edges. We show how two methods from computational vision-spatial filtering and feature detection-offer qualitatively distinct measures of animal coloration patterns. Spatial filters provide a measure of the image statistics, captured by the spatial frequency power spectrum. Image statistics give a robust but incomplete representation of the appearance of patterns, whereas feature detectors are essential for sensing and recognizing physical objects, such as distinctive markings and animal bodies. Finally, we discuss how pattern space analyses can lead to new insights into signal design and macroevolution of animal phenotypes. Overall, pattern spaces open up new possibilities for exploring how receiver vision may shape the evolution of animal pattern signals.",Rarity of Size-Assortative Mating in Animals: Assessing the Evidence with Anuran Amphibians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720359,The American naturalist,2019 02 05,"Assortative mating in animals can have substantial evolutionary impact. Numerous reports also make it appear to be pervasive in occurrence. In assortative mating, defined here in behavioral terms, animals select their mates according to a particular shared trait such that mated individuals phenotypically resemble each other more than expected by chance. Body size is a widely studied assortment trait. This is especially relevant for anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), among whom reproductive advantages may accrue to large individuals of both sexes. Anurans also exhibit discrete forms of male mating behavior. Sedentary calling behavior of ""sitters"" allows for female choice, whereas fighting for possession of mates by ""scramblers"" precludes female choice. Size-assortative mating in anurans should therefore be a property of sitters, not scramblers. I used meta-analysis to assess the occurrence of true size-assortative mating in relation to mating behavior and other variables in 282 studies of 68 species of anurans. I found publication bias against reporting nonsignificant results and analytical bias resulting from pooling of samples collected at different times or places (Simpson's paradox). Pooled samples significantly inflated the apparent occurrence and strength of size-assortative mating. Controlling for such biases left little credible evidence for size-assortative mating behavior in any anurans. Instead, large-male advantage among scramblers was associated with a secondary pattern of concomitant nonrandom mating. In this disproportionate mating, neither sex behaves according to mate choice rules that could lead to consistently strong assortment. It should thus have relatively little evolutionary impact compared to true assortative mating.",Multiple Evolutionary Routes to Monogamy: Modeling the Coevolution of Mating Decisions and Parental Investment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720358,The American naturalist,2019 02 05,"The relationships between mating decisions and parental investment are central to evolution, but to date few theoretical treatments of their coevolution have been developed. Here we adopt a demographically explicit, adaptive dynamics approach to analyze the coevolution of female mating decisions and parental investment of both sexes in a self-consistent way. Our models predict that where females cannot interfere with one another's mating decisions and where they do not differ in their survival and fecundity prospects, monogamy should be rare, favored only under harsh environmental conditions, in sparse populations. However, allowing for interference or asymmetries among females leads to selection for monogamy over a much broader range of environments and demographies. Interference by paired, resident females may prevent unmated rivals from joining existing monogamous pairs, thus barring the formation of polygynous groups. Asymmetries between established, primary females and subsequently joining secondary females may increase the relative costs of early polygynous reproduction, compared to delayed monogamy for the latter. The models thus highlight different routes by which monogamy may evolve. We further track how parental investment by the sexes coevolves with female mating decisions, highlighting how sexual conflict over parental investment is both cause and effect of mating behavior.",Within-Host Priority Effects Systematically Alter Pathogen Coexistence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720357,The American naturalist,2019 02 05,"Coinfection of host populations alters pathogen prevalence, host mortality, and pathogen evolution. Because pathogens compete for limiting resources, whether multiple pathogens can coexist in a host population can depend on their within-host interactions, which, in turn, can depend on the order in which pathogens infect hosts (within-host priority effects). However, the consequences of within-host priority effects for pathogen coexistence have not been tested. Using laboratory studies with a coinfected zooplankton system, we found that pathogens had increased fitness in coinfected hosts when they were the second pathogen to infect a host, compared to when they were the first pathogen to infect a host. With these results, we parameterized a pathogen coexistence model with priority effects, finding that pathogen coexistence (1) decreased when priority effects increased the fitness of the first pathogen to arrive in coinfected hosts and (2) increased when priority effects increased the fitness of the second pathogen to arrive in coinfected hosts. We also identified the natural conditions under which we expect within-host priority effects to foster coexistence in our system. These outcomes were the result of positive or negative frequency dependence created by feedback loops between pathogen prevalence and infection order in coinfected hosts. This suggests that priority effects can systematically alter conditions for pathogen coexistence in host populations, thereby changing pathogen community structure and potentially altering host mortality and pathogen evolution via emergent processes.",Priority Effects and Nonhierarchical Competition Shape Species Composition in a Complex Grassland Community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720356,The American naturalist,2019 02 05,"Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities-which may be far from equilibrium-remains a pressing concern. Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.",Comparison of Two Models of Family-Based Treatment for Childhood Obesity: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720354,Childhood obesity (Print),2019 05 08,"Family-based weight loss treatment (FBT) for childhood obesity, the current ""gold standard,"" is typically provided in weekly groups for 6 months.

Objective:
 Accurate pre-operative image localization is critical in the selection of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy as a surgical treatment approach in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Sestamibi scan, ultrasound, computed tomography, and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has varying accuracy in localizing parathyroid adenoma (PTA). Our group has previously shown that four-dimensional (4D) MRI is more accurate than conventional imaging in identifying single adenomas. In this study, we set out to determine if it is possible to accurately localize the quadrant of the adenoma using 4D MRI. 
Methods:
 We analyzed and matched the quadrants of PTA identified by pre-operative 4D-MRI with the operative findings during parathyroidectomy for PHPT at our institution during the study period. All resections were confirmed to be successful with an adequate decrease in intraoperative parathyroid hormone as defined by the Miami criterion. 
Results:
 A total of 26 patients with PHPT underwent pre-operative localization with the 4D MRI parathyroid protocol. Fourteen patients had true single-gland adenoma (SGA) and 12 patients had multi-gland disease (MGD). 4D MRI accurately identified all the SGA. Using this method, we were also able to localize the adenoma in the correct quadrant in 14 of the 18 patients with SGA. All 3 double adenomas were accurately identified using 4D MRI; however, MGD was only accurately identified 67% of the time. The 4D MRI had an overall 85% accuracy in distinguishing SGA from MGD. 
Conclusion:
 4D MRI accurately identified single and double adenomas in their respective quadrants. However, accuracy was lower with MGD.

The major benefit of eukaryotic expression systems is the ability to carry out posttranslational modifications of the antibody. Glycosylation of therapeutic antibodies is one of these important modifications, due to its influence on antibody structure, stability, serum half-life, and complement recruitment. In recent years, the protozoan parasite Leishmania tarentolae has been introduced as a new eukaryotic expression system. L. tarentolae is rich in glycoproteins with oligosaccharide structures that are very similar to humans. Therefore, it is touted as a potential alternative to mammalian expression systems for therapeutic antibody production. Here, we present a comparative review on the features of the L. tarentolae expression system with other expression platforms such as bacteria, insect cells, yeasts, transgenic plants, and mammalian cells with a focus on mAb production."

Objective:
 To determine the rate of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for pituitary apoplexy (PA) versus elective resection of a null cell (NC) macroadenoma. 
Methods:
 A retrospective cohort study was performed. Data was collected on all consecutive patients who underwent TSS from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2016. Patients were split into two groups: (1) patients that presented with PA, and (2) patients that underwent elective TSS for NC macroadenoma. Postoperative pituitary function was determined by examining HRT, hormone lab values, and an evaluation by an endocrinologist for each patient. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to determine if there was an association between PA and the need for HRT after surgery when compared to elective resection of a NC macroadenoma. 
Results:
 The need for HRT was significantly higher following surgery for PA compared to resection of a NC macroadenoma (14.7% versus 2.9%, OR = 5.690; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.439 to 22.500; P = .013). 
Conclusion:
 There is an increased need for hormone replacement therapy after surgery in patients with PA versus patients undergoing elective resection of a NC macroadenoma. Further studies are warranted to strengthen this data and help determine further predictors of the need for HRT.

Objectives:
 To our knowledge, no prior research has explored the prevalence of wearing continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and/or insulin pumps among in-training fellows and their perception of doing so as part of their education. Our objectives therefore were to estimate the frequency with which wearing a CGM and/or insulin pump is used as a learning opportunity and explore the main motivators and perception on its value. 
Methods:
 A multiple-choice survey that addressed each fellow's level of training, type of fellowship training program, and use of CGM and/or insulin pump was sent to all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism program coordinators or program directors. We asked them to forward this survey to their graduating fellows. Their perception on the value of wearing these devices was addressed. 
Results:
 Fifty-one graduating fellows responded to the survey; 78.43% and 62.5% of them wore a CGM and insulin pump, respectively. A total of 89.48% and 90% of those who wore a CGM and insulin pump, respectively, thought it was above-average value for their education, and the most common reasons were to learn the technical aspects and understand what patients with diabetes go through. 
Conclusion:
 Wearing a CGM and/or insulin pump is perceived by endocrinology graduating fellows as valuable to their education, specifically, to learn the technical aspects, understand the patient's experience, and develop empathy.

Objective:
 The natural biochemical history of untreated primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of biochemical fluctuations in patients with PHPT. 
Methods:
 Retrospective cohort study from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2014. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with classic (Ca >10.5 mg/dL, PTH >65 pg/mL) and nonclassic (Ca >10.5 mg/dL, PTH 40 to 65 pg/mL) PHPT were followed longitudinally at 1, 2, and 5 years. Biochemical profiles in follow-up were ranked in descending biochemical severity as classic PHPT, nonclassic PHPT, normal calcium with elevated PTH (Ca <10.5 mg/dL, PTH >65 pg/mL), possible PHPT (Ca >10.5 mg/dL, PTH 21 to 40 pg/mL), or absent PHPT (Ca >10.5 mg/dL, PTH <21 pg/mL or Ca <10.5 mg/dL, PTH <65 pg/mL). 
Results:
 Of 10,598 patients, 1,570 were treated with parathyroidectomy (n = 1,433) or medications (n = 137), and 4,367 were censored due to study closure, disenrollment, or death. In the remaining 4,661 untreated patients with 5 years of follow-up, 235 (5.0%) progressed to a state of increased biochemical severity, whereas 972 (20.8%) remained the same, and 3,454 (74.1%) regressed to milder biochemical states. In 2,522 untreated patients with classic PHPT, patients most frequently transitioned to the normal calcium with elevated PTH group (n = 1,257, 49.8%). In 2,139 untreated patients with nonclassic PHPT, patients most frequently transitioned to the absent PHPT group (n = 1,354, 63.3%).

 PHPT is a biochemically dynamic disease with significant numbers of patients exhibiting both increases and decreases in biochemical severity.

The glassy critical point is marked by a proliferation of protocols with close-to-optimal fidelity and with a true optimum that appears exponentially difficult to locate. Using a machine learning (ML) inspired framework based on the manifold learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, we are able to visualize the geometry of the high-dimensional control landscape in an effective low-dimensional representation. Across the transition, the control landscape features an exponential number of clusters separated by extensive barriers, which bears a strong resemblance with replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses and random satisfiability problems. We further show that the quantum control landscape maps onto a disorder-free classical Ising model with frustrated nonlocal, multibody interactions.

Here we show that nanoscale oscillatory displacements of microscale spherical probes in contact with the TM are resisted by frequency-dependent forces that are in phase with TM displacement at low and high frequencies, but are in phase with TM velocity at transition frequencies. The phase lead can be as much as a quarter of a cycle, thereby contributing to frequency selectivity and stability of cochlear amplification."

In fact, to recover the Hamiltonian acting on each finite spatial domain, only observables within that domain are required. The observables can be measured in a Gibbs state as well as a single eigenstate; furthermore, they can be measured in a state evolved by the Hamiltonian for a long time, allowing us to recover a large family of time-dependent Hamiltonians.

We demonstrate that out-of-time-order correlators can spread slowly beyond the single-particle localization length, despite the absence of many-body interactions. This phenomenon is shown to be due to the nonlocal relationship between elementary excitations and the physical degrees of freedom. We argue that this nonlocality becomes relevant for time-dependent correlation functions. In addition, a slow logarithmic-in-time growth of the entanglement entropy is observed following a quench from an unentangled initial state. We attribute this growth to the presence of strong zero modes, which gives rise to an exponential hierarchy of time scales upon ensemble averaging.

In the presence of structure inversion symmetry, the zero Hall plateau state shows a quantum-Hall-type critical point, originating from the two decoupled subsystems with opposite Chern numbers.

By further tracing the LL crossings in the Landau fan diagram, we unambiguously determine the density-dependent valley susceptibility and the interaction enhanced g-factor from 12.7 to 23.6. Near integer ratios of Zeeman-to-cyclotron energies, we discover LL anticrossings due to the formation of quantum Hall Ising ferromagnets, the valley polarizations of which appear to be reversible by tuning the density or an in-plane magnetic field. Our results provide evidence for many-body interaction effects in the conduction band of MoS2 and establish a fertile ground for exploring strongly correlated phenomena of massive Dirac electrons.",Surfactant Structure-Dependent Interactions with Modified Starch Nanoparticles Probed by Fluorescence Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720285,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 05,"The interactions between the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) and starch nanoparticles (SNPs) hydrophobically modified with the hydrophobic dye pyrene (Py-SNPs) were investigated in water by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence. The Py-SNPs formed interparticulate aggregates in water, which were disrupted by adding SDS to the Py-SNP aqueous dispersions. SDS was found to interact with Py-SNPs at SDS concentrations that were close to 2 orders of magnitude lower than its critical micelle concentration (CMC). These interactions led to the breakup of the Py-SNP aggregates, which was confirmed by conducting fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments between naphthalene-labeled SNPs (Np-SNPs) and Py-SNPs. By the time the SDS concentration reached the CMC of SDS, the Py-SNPs were separated from each other and excimer was generated from isolated Py-SNPs in the aqueous dispersions. Whereas SDS interacted with the Py-SNPs at SDS concentrations lower than CMC, SDS did not seem to target the hydrophobic pyrene aggregates. Only above the CMC did SDS appear to interact with the pyrene aggregates, as evidenced from diffusive pyrene excimer formation between excited and ground-state pyrenes. Most surprisingly, no interaction was observed between sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) and Py-SNP at AOT concentrations where SDS interacted with the Py-SNPs. This observation led to the conclusion that SDS below its CMC interacted not with hydrophobic pyrene aggregates but rather through the formation of inclusion complexes, which led to the electrostatic stabilization of individual Py-SNPs and enabled the breakup of Py-SNP aggregates. The formation of inclusion complexes with linear surfactants like SDS might thus provide a new means of stabilizing hydrophobically modified starch nanoparticles in water, which bears the promise of finding future applications."

However, probing the complex dynamics of endogenous RNA in live cells is a challenging task. In the present study, a DNA transformer is designed for visualizing the abundance, distribution, and mobility of endogenous mRNAs in live human cells. The transformable tetrahedral DNA (T-TED) probe has a flexible hinge structure and is programmed to conform into a 3D tetrahedron upon binding with the target mRNA. By incorporating Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging, super-resolution localization, and single particle tracking, the T-TED biosensor is applied for investigating the dynamics of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) mRNA, which encodes a transmembrane protein, in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. The data reveal unprecedented subpopulations of Dll4 mRNA with distinct mobility organized spatially in association with the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubule networks. The ability to monitor the dynamics of endogenous RNA in live human cells will provide a useful tool for studying the functions and regulation of RNA.",Co-Substitution Enhances the Rate Capability and Stabilizes the Cyclic Performance of O3-Type Cathode NaNi0.45- xMn0.25Ti0.3Co xO2 for Sodium-Ion Storage at High Voltage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720273,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"O3-type NaNiO2-based cathode materials suffer irreversible phase transition when they are charged to above 4.0 V in sodium-ion batteries. To solve this problem, we partially substitute Ni2+ in O3-type NaNi0.45Mn0.25Ti0.3O2 by Co3+. NaNi0.45Mn0.25Ti0.3O2 with co-substitution possesses an expanded interlayer and exhibits higher rate capability, as well as cyclic stability, compared with the pristine cathode in 2.0-4.4 V. The optimal NaNi0.4Mn0.25Ti0.3Co0.05O2 delivers discharge capacities of 180 and 80 mA  h  g-1 at 10 and 1000 mA g-1. At 100 mA g-1, NaNi0.4Mn0.25Ti0.3Co0.05O2 exhibits 152 mA h g-1 in the initial cycle and maintains 91.4 mA h g-1 after 180 cycles. Through ex situ X-ray diffraction, co-substitution is demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the reversibility of P3-P3″ phase transition from 4.0 to 4.4 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates that higher electronic conductivity is achieved by co-substitution. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique demonstrate faster kinetics for Na+ diffusion due to the co-substitution.

The physicochemical properties of synthesized materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N2-sorption, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric (TG)/TG-FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis-near infrared, NH3/CO2-temperature programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Their CO2/N2 adsorption performances were evaluated by isotherm adsorption and dynamic adsorption experiments. We found that the MW is a rapid and facile protocol for the synthesis of MOF-74 (Ni) materials with highly efficient CO2 capture capacity. The well-shaped MW-140 adsorbent with superior CO2 adsorption capacity of 5.22 mmol/g at 25 °C can be obtained within 60 min by the MW process, almost 6 times higher than that of the commercial activated carbon (0.89 mmol/g). Results of dynamic adsorption experiments showed that the MW-140 material possesses the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.37 mmol/g under humid conditions (RH = 90%). Importantly, MW-140 has excellent adsorption stability and recyclability, superior CO2 capture selectivity (CO2/N2 = 31), and appropriate isosteric heat in CO2 adsorption (21-38 kJ/mol), making it a promising and potential material for industrial CO2 capture. Characterization results demonstrated that the high capture capability of MOF-74 (Ni) materials can be attributed to the synergistic effect of abundant narrow micropore channels and rich five-coordinated Ni2+ open metal sites which are beneficial for the trapping of CO2 molecules.",Gold Nanorods-Based Smart Nanoplatforms for Synergic Thermotherapy and Chemotherapy of Tumor Metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720270,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 28,"The combination therapy of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy as a promising strategy has drawn extensive attention by overcoming the limitations of conventional treatments in tumor therapy.

The GNRs@PDA-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-DOX nanocomplex showed robust stability and excellent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion efficiency under laser irradiation. The release of loaded DOX from GNRs@PDA-PEG-DOX nanocomposites was improved in tumor microenvironments. Furthermore, the PDA-functionalized GNR nanocomposites were expected to be potential photoacoustic imaging agents for imaging-guided tumor therapy. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the efficiency of tumor inhibition of GNRs@PDA-PEG-DOX is greater than that of the other group in vitro and in vivo, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining, demonstrating a promising strategy for suppression of tumor metastasis and low long-term systemic toxicity. These results illustrated a promising strategy of tailor-made GNRs@PDA-PEG-DOX nanoplatforms for ablation of tumor and suppression of tumor metastasis in clinical application.",Tunable Light Emission and Multiresponsive Luminescent Sensitivities in Aqueous Solutions of Two Series of Lanthanide Metal-Organic Frameworks Based on Structurally Related Ligands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720269,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Two series of lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) from two structurally related flexible carboxylate-based ligands were solvothermally synthesized. H3L2 with additional -CH2- group provides more flexibility and different coordination modes and conformations compared with H3L1. As a result, 2-Ln MOFs are modulated from two-dimensional kgd of 1-Ln to three-dimensional rtl topological frameworks and further achieve enhanced chemical stability. The Eu- and Tb-MOFs exhibit strong fluorescent emission at the solid state because of the antenna effect of the ligands. Interestingly, the emissions can be tuned by simply doping Eu3+ and Tb3+ of different concentrations within the Eu xTb1- x MOFs. Notably, 2-Ln MOFs realize nearly white light emission by means of a trichromatic approach (red of Eu(III), green of Tb(III), and blue of the H3L2 ligand). Furthermore, 2-Ln MOFs also exhibit water stability and demonstrate high selective and sensitive sensing activities toward Fe(III) and Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions. The results further highlight the importance of the ligand flexibility on tuning MOF structures with improved structural stability and ion-sensing properties.",Novel Deoxyvasicinone-Donepezil Hybrids as Potential Multitarget Drug Candidates for Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720268,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 05 15,"In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of deoxyvasicinone-donepezil hybrids and determined whether they could be used as novel multitarget inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease.

In this study, we report room-temperature-operated solution-processed photodetectors by PbSe quantum dots (QDs) with spectral response from 350 to 2500 nm. In order to boost both external quantum efficiency (EQE) and projected detectivity ( D*), the hole-trap-assisted photomultiplication effect through the EDT-PbSe QD/TABI PbSe QD double-thin-layer thin film, where EDT-PbSe QDs are 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)-capped PbSe QDs and TABI-PbSe QDs are tetrabutylammonium (TABI)-capped PbSe QDs, is applied. To further enhance D*, a thin layer of the conjugated polyelectrolyte, which offers significant hole injection resistance for suppressing dark current but enhancing photocurrent under illumination due to the photoinduced self-doping process, is applied for reengineering the electron extraction layer in PbSe QD-based photodetectors.

The prepared materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction transient-state photoluminescence spectra, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical experiment. These results show that the ternary composite material has longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers and more active sites, thereby enhancing photocatalytic performance. CdS quantum dots act as a bridge between the intermediate transport charges in the ternary composite. The oxygen defect engineering prolongs the lifetime of carriers obviously, which is confirmed by transient-state photoluminescence. Moreover, the photocatalytic H2 evolution and photodegradation of bisphenol A for MoS2/CdS/g-C3N4 is up to 956 μmol h-1 g-1 and 95.2% under visible-light irradiation, respectively.

Although carrier concentration may play an essential role in spin transport in these devices, direct experimental evidence of its importance is lacking. We probed the role of the charge carrier concentration by studying the interplay between MR and multilevel resistive switching in OSVs. The present work demonstrates that all salient features of these devices, particularly the intimate correlation between MR and resistance, can be accounted for by the impurity band model, based on oxygen migration. Finally, we highlight the critical importance of the carrier concentration in determining spin transport and MR in OSVs and the role of interface-mediated oxygen migration in controlling the OSV response."

Part A,2019 03 28,"To provide sustained release of exenatide and enhance therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes compared to the existing products for exenatide, we developed an exenatide-loaded, redox-active, injectable gel (Exe@RIG). This injectable gel is formed by a polyion complex (PIC) comprising three components, (1) cationic polyamine-poly(ethylene glycol)-polyamine triblock copolymer possessing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging moieties as side chains, (2) anionic poly(acrylic acid), and (3) exenatide. The mixture formed exenatide-loaded PIC flower micelles at room temperature, which immediately converted to a gel under physiological conditions. Owing to electrostatic interactions between exenatide and the PIC gel network, RIG was able to provide sustained release of exenatide without a significant initial burst. Subcutaneous injection of Exe@RIG once a week prevented the increase in glucose concentration significantly in db/db mice compared to those in control groups. In addition, Exe@RIG suppressed the degeneration of pancreatic islets, which is reported to be caused by increased ROS.

This study examined the effects of ecologically relevant levels of ALAN on three key measures of immune function (haemocyte concentration, lytic activity, and phenoloxidase activity) using a model invertebrate species, the Australian black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. We reared crickets under an ecologically relevant daily light-cycle consisting of 12 hr bright daylight (2600 lx) followed by either 12 h darkness (0 lx) or dim environmentally relevant ALAN (1, 10, 100 lx), and then assessed immune function at multiple time points throughout adult life using haemolymph samples. We found that the presence of ALAN had a clear negative effect on haemocytes, while the effects on lytic activity and phenoloxidase activity were more complex or largely unaffected by ALAN. Furthermore, the effects of lifelong exposure to ALAN of 1 lx were comparable to those of 10 and 100 lx. Our data suggest that the effects of ALAN could be large and widespread, and such reductions in the core immune response of individuals will likely have greater consequences for fitness and survival under more malign conditions, such as those of the natural environment.",A Tetrasilicon Analogue of Bicyclo[1.1.0]but-1(3)-ene Containing a Si=Si Double Bond with an Inverted Geometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720237,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 15,"Bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasil-1(3)-ene 1, a tetrasilicon analogue of bicyclo[1.1.0]but-1(3)-ene that contains a formal double bond between bridgehead silicon atoms in an inverted geometry, was synthesized and isolated in the form of thermally stable orange crystals. The distance between the bridgehead Si atoms in 1 is much longer than those in typical Si=Si bonds, but still shorter than that of a previously reported pentasila[1.1.1]propellane. DFT calculations suggest that the bridgehead bond in 1 comprises a σ bond with an inverted geometry and a π bond. This notion is supported by the UV/Vis spectrum of 1, which exhibits several absorption bands in the UV/Vis region. While 1 is stable toward typical trapping agents for Si=Si double bonds, 1 reacts with carbon tetrachloride to furnish a hexachlorotetrasilane.",Corticobasal syndrome: neuroimaging and neurophysiological advances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720235,European journal of neurology,2019 04 13,"Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by 4R tau protein deposition in several brain regions that clinically manifests itself as a heterogeneous atypical parkinsonism typically expressed in adulthood. The prototypical clinical phenotype of CBD is corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Important insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying motor and higher cortical symptoms in CBS have been gained by using advanced neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies often show asymmetric cortical and subcortical abnormalities, mainly involving perirolandic and parietal regions and basal ganglia structures. Neurophysiological investigations including electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked potentials provide useful information on the origin of myoclonus and on cortical sensory loss. Transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrates heterogeneous and asymmetric changes in the excitability and plasticity of primary motor cortex and abnormal hemispheric connectivity. Neuroimaging and neurophysiological abnormalities in multiple brain areas reflect asymmetric neurodegeneration, leading to asymmetric motor and higher cortical symptoms in CBS.",The pre-separation of oxygen containing compounds in oxidised heavy paraffinic fractions and their identification by GC-MS with supersonic molecular beams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720234,Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,2019 04 12,The heavy petroleum fractions produced during refining processes need to be upgraded to useable products to increase their value. Hydrogenated heavy paraffinic fractions can be oxidised to produce high value products that contain a variety of oxygenates. These heavy oxygenated paraffinic fractions need to be characterised to enable the control of oxidation processes and to understand product properties. The accurate identification of the oxygenates present in these fractions by electron ionisation (EI) mass spectrometry is challenging due to the complexity of these heavy fractions. Adding to this challenge is the limited applicability of EI mass spectral libraries due to the absence of molecular ions from the EI mass spectra of many oxygenates. The separation of oxygenates from the complex hydrocarbon matrix prior to high temperature GC-MS (HT-GC-MS) analysis reduces the complexity of these fractions and assists in the accurate identification of these oxygenates. Solid phase extraction (SPE) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) were employed as prefractionation techniques. GC-MS with supersonic molecular beams (SMBs) (also named GC-MS with cold-EI) utilises a SMB interface with which EI is done with vibrationally cold sample compounds in a fly-through ion source (cold-EI) resulting in a substantial increase in the molecular ion signal intensity in the mass spectrum. This greatly enhances the accurate identification of the oxygenates in these fractions. This study investigated the ionisation behaviour of oxygenated compounds using cold-EI. The prefractionation by SPE and SFC and the subsequent analysis with GC-MS with cold-EI were applied to an oxygenated heavy paraffinic fraction.,"Metabolically Active, Fully Hydrolysable Polymersomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720233,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 07,"The synthesis and aqueous self-assembly of a new class of amphiphilic aliphatic polyesters are presented.

Aberrant expression of bhlh transcription factors has been shown to be associated with multiple tumorigenesis. We previously identified that sohlh2 functioned as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer. Here, we examined the expression levels of sohlh2 in human breast cancer and its potential role in disease pathogenesis. The results of sohlh2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis demonstrated the decreased sohlh2 expression in breast cancer specimens as compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues. Through in vitro MTT, BrdU, colony formation and cell cycle assays and in vivo tumor xenograft studies, we showed that forced expression of sohlh2 led to a significant reduction in proliferation due to G1 arrest in vitro and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Conversely, silencing of sohlh2 enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we confirmed that sohlh2 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. APC was the direct target of sohlh2, and mediated the inhibitory activities of sohlh2 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, our data indicate that sohlh2 likely functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer that is mediated by repressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via upregulation of APC expression.",Reduced camptothecin sensitivity of estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells following exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is associated with DNA methylation changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720231,Environmental toxicology,2019 04 22,"Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) has been considered as an estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) agonist due to its ability to interact with ERα and promote the cell proliferation of ERα-positive breast cancer cells. The impact of DEHP on the chemical therapy in breast cancer is little known. Two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (ERα-dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (ERα-independent) were examined. We found that DEHP impaired the effectiveness of camptothecin (CPT) and alleviated the CPT-induced formation of reactive oxygen species in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells, but not in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. DEHP also significantly protected MCF-7 cells against the genotoxicity of CPT. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling revealed that after 48 hours of exposure to 100 μM DEHP, MCF-7 cells exhibited a significant change in their DNA methylation pattern, including hypermethylation of 700 genes and hypomethylation of 221 genes. The impaired therapeutic response to CPT in DEHP-exposed MCF-7 cells is probably mediated by epigenetic changes, especially through Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A zebrafish xenograft model confirmed the disruptive effect of DEHP on CPT-induced anti-growth of MCF-7 cells. In summary, DEHP exposure induces acquired CPT-resistance in breast cancer cells and epigenetic changes associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation are probably depending on an ER-positive status."

Urine and serum samples were obtained from each dog at a single time-point and processed and analyzed for relevant protein biomarkers. Urinary concentrations of CTX-II (p < 0.001) and TIMP-1 (p = 0.002) were significantly lower in dogs with CHD compared to dogs with no CHD. ROC curve analyses were successful in establishing a panel of four biomarkers (urinary CTX-I and II, serum MMP-9, and serum PIICP) with high discriminatory capability for the presence or absence of hip dysplasia in adult dogs (AUC = 0.89).

Following rupture, ankle immobilization in plantarflexion is thought to aid healing by restoring tendon end-to-end apposition. However, early activity may improve limb function, challenging the role of immobilization position on tendon healing, as it may affect loading across the injury site. This study investigated the effects of ankle immobilization angle in a rat model of Achilles tendon rupture. We hypothesized that manipulating the ankle from full plantarflexion into a more dorsiflexed position during the immobilization period would result in superior hindlimb function and tendon properties, but that prolonged casting in dorsiflexion would result in inferior outcomes. After Achilles tendon transection, animals were randomized into eight immobilization groups ranging from full plantarflexion (160°) to mid-point (90°) to full dorsiflexion (20°), with or without angle manipulation. Tendon properties and ankle function were influenced by ankle immobilization position and time. Tendon lengthening occurred after 1 week at 20° compared to more plantarflexed angles, and was associated with loss of propulsion force. Dorsiflexing the ankle during immobilization from 160° to 90° produced a stiffer, more aligned tendon, but did not lead to functional changes compared to immobilization at 160°. Although more dorsiflexed immobilization can enhance tissue properties and function of healing Achilles tendon following rupture, full dorsiflexion creates significant tendon elongation regardless of application time. This study suggests that the use of moderate plantarflexion and earlier return to activity can provide improved clinical outcomes. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

SD rats were randomly separated into control and model groups, and placed outside or inside of a hypobaric chamber, respectively. Subsequent to 24 h anoxic exposure, plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured using commercial biochemical kits. Hematoxylin‑eosin (H&E), Nissl's and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampus. The protein expression levels of apoptotic protease activating factor‑1 (Apaf‑1), hypoxia inducible factor‑1α (HIF‑1α), caspase‑3, cleaved caspase‑3, Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax) and cytochrome c (cyto‑c) were detected using western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Hypoxic substantially induced morphological lesions in the hippocampus concomitant with the physical behavioral performance deficit. Furthermore, hypoxia markedly exacerbated the levels of MDA, LDH and GSSG, and restrained GSH (P<0.01) and SOD (P<0.05) levels compared with the control group. In addition, hypoxia significantly induced the protein expression of Apaf‑1, HIF‑1α, caspase‑3, cleaved caspase‑3, Bax and Cyto‑c (P<0.01) compared with the control group. Finally, a lower number and volume of Nissl bodies were verified in the hypoxic group. TUNEL results demonstrated a greater number of apoptotic cells in the hypoxic group. The present study demonstrates a model of rat hypoxic brain injuries induced by a hypobaric chamber at 9,000 m for 24 h.

The oxidized products are multifunctional. In this study, we investigated how oxidized fatty acids inhibit cell proliferation in cultured cells. We used polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5), linoleic acid (LA; 18:2), and palmitic acid (16:0). Oxidized fatty acids were produced by autoxidation of fatty acids for 2 days in the presence of a gas mixture (20% O2 and 80% N2). We found that oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (OxDHA, OxEPA and OxLA) inhibited cell proliferation much more effectively compared with un‑oxidized fatty acids (DHA, EPA and LA, respectively) in THP‑1 (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) and DLD‑1 (a human colorectal cancer cell line) cells. In particular, OxDHA markedly inhibited cell proliferation. DHA has the largest number of double bonds and is most susceptible to oxidation among the fatty acids. OxDHA has the largest number of highly active oxidized products. Therefore, the oxidative levels of fatty acids are associated with the anti‑proliferative activity. Moreover, caspase‑3/7 was activated in the cells treated with OxDHA, but not in those treated with DHA. A pan‑caspase inhibitor (zVAD‑fmk) reduced the cell death induced by OxDHA. These results indicated that oxidized products from polyunsaturated fatty acids induced apoptosis in cultured cells. Collectively, the switch between cell survival and cell death may be regulated by the activity and/or number of oxidized products from polyunsaturated fatty acids.",Inflammatory and fibrosis infiltration in synovium associated with the progression in developmental dysplasia of the hip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720141,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common musculoskeletal disorder characterized by progressive joint soreness and limited mobility. The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathological changes and inflammatory infiltration in the hypertrophic synovium of the hip joint associated with the progression of DDH. Synovial biopsies in the hip joint are obtained from patients with moderate DDH and severe DDH during surgery. These biopsies are processed for histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and investigation of the pathological processes in a synovium, including types of inflammatory cell infiltration, synovial angiogenesis and fibrosis, neuron endings and neuropeptide invasion. Correlation analysis was performed between the mean optical density (MOD) of each antibody, and Harris hip score (HHS) and visual analogue score (VAS) using the Spearman correlation test. Chronic inflammation in the synovium was observed via the positive IHC staining of inflammatory cells, such as T cells, B cells, macrophages and leukocytes. Excessive staining of vimentin and α smooth muscle actin in the synovium of severe DDH represented significant fibrosis and angiogenesis. These targets were also significantly correlated with HHS in severe DDH. The MOD levels of CD68 (indicators of macrophage) indicated apparent correlations with HHS and VAS in patients with severe DDH. The labels of nerve fibers and pain transmission indicators were as follows: Neurofilament‑200 and substance P. Calcitonin gene‑related peptide was upregulated in the synovium of severe DDH in contrast to that in the synovium of moderate DDH. The MOD levels of NF‑200, SP and CGRP were correlated with VAS in severe DDH. The pathology of DDH includes chronic inflammatory cell infiltration corresponding with nerve fibers and fibroblastic proliferation, which might contribute to arthritis progression and joint soreness in DDH.",Ketamine‑induced bladder dysfunction is associated with extracellular matrix accumulation and impairment of calcium signaling in a mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720140,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Due to the rising abuse of ketamine usage in recent years, ketamine‑induced urinary tract syndrome has received increasing attention. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying ketamine‑associated cystitis in a mouse model. Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups: One group was treated with ketamine (100 mg/kg/day of ketamine for 20 weeks), whereas, the control group was treated with saline solution. In each group, micturition frequency and urine volume were examined to assess urinary voiding functions. Mouse bladders were extracted and samples were examined for pathological and morphological alterations using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson's trichrome staining and scanning electron microscopy. A cDNA microarray was conducted to investigate the differentially expressed genes following treatment with ketamine. The results suggested that bladder hyperactivity increased in the mice treated with ketamine. Furthermore, treatment with ketamine resulted in a smooth apical epithelial surface, subepithelial vascular congestion and lymphoplasmacytic aggregation. Microarray analysis identified a number of genes involved in extracellular matrix accumulation, which is associated with connective tissue fibrosis progression, and in calcium signaling regulation, that was associated with urinary bladder smooth muscle contraction. Collectively, the present results suggested that these differentially expressed genes may serve critical roles in ketamine‑induced alterations of micturition patterns and urothelial pathogenesis. Furthermore, the present findings may provide a theoretical basis for the development of effective therapies to treat ketamine‑induced urinary tract syndrome.",Rhynchophylline ameliorates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury through the modulation of mitochondrial mechanisms to mediate myocardial apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720139,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Rhynchophylline (RP), the primary active ingredient of Uncaria rhynchophylla, has an anti‑hypertensive effect and protects against ischemia‑induced neuronal damage. The present study aimed to examine the roles and mechanisms of RP in myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion (MI/R) injury of rat cardiomyocytes. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell apoptosis were examined by a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. An ELISA was performed to assess the expression of oxidative stress markers. Spectrophotometry was used to detect the degree of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) openness. Western blotting and reverse transcription‑ quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to evaluate the associated protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The present results demonstrated that RP increased the cell viability of MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes, and suppressed the MI/R‑induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, RP modulated the Ca2+ and MMP levels in MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, RP decreased the oxidative stress and mPTP level of MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes. It was additionally observed that RP affected the apoptosis‑associated protein expression and regulated the mitochondrial‑associated gene expression in MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, RP ameliorated MI/R injury through the modulation of mitochondrial mechanisms. The potential effects of RP on the protection of MI/R‑induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes suggest that RP may be an effective target for MI/R therapy.",Isaindigotone as an inhibitor of the lipopolysaccharide‑induced inflammatory reaction of BV‑2 cells and corresponding mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720138,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Isaindigotone possesses extensive pharmacological activities, including anti‑inflammatory effects. The present study investigated the role of isaindigotone in the inhibition of neuroinflammation. Mouse BV‑2 cells were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/l) for 24 h in a microglial inflammatory model in vitro. The effects of isaindigotone on BV‑2 cell proliferation were observed using the 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Following co‑incubation, an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis were used to analyze cellular levels of cytokines and associated protein expression, including the phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)‑κB. The effects of isaindigotone concentration on LPS‑mediated cell chemotaxis behavior were assessed using a chemotaxis assay. The results indicated that isaindigotone is non‑toxic towards BV‑2 cells. Compared with the LPS group, isaindigotone significantly reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑1β in BV‑2 cells and reduced the cell chemotaxis caused by LPS; it also reversed morphological changes in the BV‑2 cells and inhibited the phosphorylation of NF‑κB. The results of the present study suggest that isaindigotone can inhibit inflammatory reactions in LPS‑induced BV‑2 cells, and provides a theoretical basis and experimental evidence for examining the mechanism underlying the isaindigotone‑induced inhibition of neuroinflammation.",MACC1 overexpression in carcinoma‑associated fibroblasts induces the invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells via paracrine signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720137,International journal of oncology,2019 04 09,"Carcinoma‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are essential for initiating lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis. An elevated MACC1 expression has been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Hitherto, the role of MACC1 in lung adenocarcinoma‑derived CAFs remains unclear. In this study, CAFs isolated from the tissues of patients with lung adenocarcinoma expressed typical CAF markers (shown by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis) and exhibited enhanced migration and invasion abilities when co‑cultured with A549 cells in a microfluidic model. MACC1‑overexpressing CAFs not only demonstrated an increased invasion, but also exerted a promoting effect on the invasion of tumor cells. The reduced expression of MACC1 impaired the invasive ability of the CAFs. Western blot analysis and RT‑qPCR analysis demonstrated that multiple paracrine pathways were activated in the MACC1‑overexpressing CAFs. Overall, this study presents a novel role of MACC1 in CAF‑induced lung adenocarcinoma cell invasion, which possibly occurs via paracrine signaling. Furthermore, MACC1 was indicated to be a potential therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.",Long non-coding RNA TUG1 recruits miR‑29c‑3p from its target gene RGS1 to promote proliferation and metastasis of melanoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720136,International journal of oncology,2019 04 09,"Melanoma is an aggressive type of skin cancer, characterized by high mortality rates worldwide. Therefore, the identification of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for melanoma is imperative. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in tumor initiation and progression. It was recently reported that the expression of lncRNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) was relatively higher in cancer compared with that in normal cells, and that TUG1 promoted the progression of various cancers. However, the pattern of expression and mechanism of action of TUG1 in melanoma remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether TUG1 expression is relatively higher in melanoma tissues and whether this expression is correlated with poor overall survival. Knockdown of TUG1 was found to suppress melanoma cell growth and metastasis and induce cell apoptosis. By contrast, the overexpression of TUG1 promoted the growth and metastasis of melanoma cells, and inhibited their apoptosis. In addition, the results of the present study indicated that TUG1 sequestered endogenous miR‑29c‑3p and that it was able to suppress its expression. Furthermore, it was observed that miR‑29c‑3p could reverse the promoting effect of TUG1 on melanoma progression, which may be associated with the positive regulation of regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1), a target gene of miR‑29c‑3p. Taken together, the data of the present study demonstrated that TUG1 promoted proliferation and invasion and suppressed apoptosis in melanoma cells by regulating miR‑29c‑3p and its target gene, RGS1. Therefore, lncRNA TUG1 appears to be a promising diagnostic marker for melanoma patients.",A novel mechanism for the anticancer activity of aspirin and salicylates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720135,International journal of oncology,2019 04 09,"Epidemiological studies indicate that long‑term aspirin usage reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and may protect against other non‑CRC associated adenocarcinomas, including oesophageal cancer. A number of hypotheses have been proposed with respect to the molecular action of aspirin and other non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs in cancer development. The mechanism by which aspirin exhibits toxicity to CRC has been previously investigated by synthesising novel analogues and derivatives of aspirin in an effort to identify functionally significant moieties. Herein, an early effect of aspirin and aspirin‑like analogues against the SW480 CRC cell line was investigated, with a particular focus on critical molecules in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. The present authors proposed that aspirin, diaspirin and analogues, and diflunisal (a salicylic acid derivative) may rapidly perturb EGF and EGF receptor (EGFR) internalisation. Upon longer incubations, the diaspirins and thioaspirins may inhibit EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1045 and Tyr1173. It was additionally demonstrated, using a qualitative approach, that EGF internalisation in the SW480 cell line may be directed to endosomes by fumaryldiaspirin using early endosome antigen 1 as an early endosomal marker and that EGF internalisation may also be perturbed in oesophageal cell lines, suggestive of an effect not only restricted to CRC cells. Taken together and in light of our previous findings that the aspirin‑like analogues can affect cyclin D1 expression and nuclear factor‑κB localisation, it was hypothesized that aspirin and aspirin analogues significantly and swiftly perturb the EGFR axis and that the protective activity of aspirin may in part be explained by perturbed EGFR internalisation and activation. These findings may also have implications in understanding the inhibitory effect of aspirin and salicylates on wound healing, given the critical role of EGF in the response to tissue trauma."

Therefore, novel drugs for osteosarcoma treatment are required. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural compound, has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of various tumors. However, it is unclear whether ISL is able to inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma. In the present study, it was identified that ISL was able to inhibit the growth of the osteosarcoma cell line Saos‑2 cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors primarily by attenuating tumor cell proliferation and, cell migration and promoting tumor cell apoptosis. Decreased tumor cell proliferation induced by ISL was associated with downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of p53, p21 and p27. Increased tumor cell apoptosis triggered by ISL was associated with downregulation of apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2, upregulation of apoptosis regulator Bax and damaged mitochondrial function evidenced by a low level of ATP‑synthesis. In addition, ISL was able to inhibit the migratory capacity of Saos‑2 cells by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the tumor growth‑inhibitory effect of ISL may depend on the action of ISL on the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. However, it remains to be investigated whether the inhibitory effect of ISL on the migration of Saos‑2 cells was associated with downregulated PI3K/AKT signaling. Overall, the present study provided evidence for the potential use of ISL against osteosarcoma.",Cellular and radiobiological effects of carbonic anhydrase IX in human breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720123,Oncology reports,2019 04 09,"Hypoxia‑induced carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is involved in intracellular and extracellular pH regulation, which is critical for tumor growth and metastasis. CAIX is overexpressed in breast cancer and is associated with the poor survival of patients after radiotherapy. Therefore, we evaluated the cellular and radiobiological effects of CAIX inhibition in human breast cancer cells. We used CA9 siRNA and the CA inhibitor (CAI) U104, respectively, to inhibit CAIX expression and activity in basal triple‑negative MDA‑MB‑231 and luminal MCF‑7 cells under hypoxic conditions. We investigated the effects of CAIX inhibition on CA9 mRNA and CAIX protein level, as well as on CAIX activity, intracellular pH, proliferation, apoptosis, clonogenic survival, migration, cell cycle distribution and radiosensitivity. CA9 siRNA and CAI U104 decreased CA9 mRNA and CAIX protein level in MDA‑MB‑231 and MCF‑7 cells. Furthermore, incubation with CAI U104 significantly decreased carbonic anhydrase activity and reduced the intracellular pH. Additionally, CA9 siRNA or U104 reduced clonogenic survival, migration and the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase, induced apoptosis and demonstrated additive or synergistic effects in combination with irradiation. In conclusion, combination of CAIX inhibition and irradiation is a promising treatment strategy against breast cancer with hypoxia‑induced CAIX expression.","[Erratum] OBP‑801, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, induces M‑phase arrest and apoptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720122,Oncology reports,2019 06 11,"Subsequent to the publication of the above article, the authors have realized that errors were introduced into Fig. 4 at the typesetting stage.

Numerous progressively enlarging cysts are observed in the bilateral kidneys of patients with PKD, inducing structural damage and loss of kidney function. The present study analyzed one family with PKD. Whole exome sequencing of the proband was performed to detect the pathogenic gene present in the family. Candidate gene segments for lineal consanguinity in the family were amplified by nest polymerase chain reaction, followed by Sanger sequencing. One novel duplication variant (NM_001009944.2:c.9359dupA:p.Y3120_E3121delinsX) and one missense mutation (c.G9022A:p.V3008M) were detected in PKD1. Additionally, the pathogenic substitutions in PKD1 published from the dataset were analyzed. Following analysis and confirmation, the duplication variant NM_001009944.2:c.9359dupA:p.Y3120_E3121delinsX in PKD1, within the polycystin‑1, lipoxygenase, α‑toxin domain, was considered to be the pathogenic factor in the examined family with autosomal dominant PKD. Additionally, based on the analysis of 4,805 pathogenic substitutions in PKD1 within various regions, the presence of the missense mutation in the N‑terminal domain of polycystin‑1 may present high pathogenicity in ADPKD.",NSPc1 polycomb protein complex binds and cross‑talks to lncRNAs in glioma H4 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720120,Oncology reports,2019 04 09,"Recently, emerging evidence shows that a number of long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recruit polycomb group (PcG) proteins to specific chromatin loci to silence relevant gene expression. In the present study, we provided evidence that lncRNA candidates, selected by bioinformatic analysis and nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPc1), a key polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) member, were highly expressed in glioma H4 cells in contrast to that noted in non‑cancerous cells. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays demonstrated that metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT) and maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) among the 8 candidates bound to the NSPc1 protein complex in glioma H4 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NSPc1 caused a decrease in the expression of MALAT1 and MEG3 and increased expression of SOX2OT, while NSPc1 downregulation caused the levels of all three genes to increase. Meanwhile, suppression of the expression of MALAT1 increased the expression levels of mRNA and protein of NSPc1, whereas downregulation of the expression of SOX2OT decreased NSPc1 expression. Moreover, a significant decrease in cell growth and increased cell apoptosis were observed in the transfected H4 cells by MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that the reduced co‑expression between NSPc1 and MALAT1/SOX2OT decreased the proliferation and promoted the death of H4 cells more obviously than the respectively decrease in expression of NSPc1, MALAT1 and SOX2OT. Remarkably, the influence of a simultaneously decreased expression of NSPc1 and SOX2OT on promoting cell apoptosis was more obvious than the total effect of the separate downregulation of NSPc1 and SOX2OT on accelerating cell death. However, that impact was partially counteracted in the silencing of the co‑expression of MALAT1 and NSPc1. Furthermore, they cooperated to affect transcription of p21 and OCT4.Briefly, these data suggest NSPc1 polycomb protein complex binding and cross‑talk to lncRNAs in glioma H4 cells, offering new insight into the important function of polycomb protein complex and lncRNA interactions in glioma cells and provide a novel view of potential biomarkers and targets for the diagnosis and therapy of glioma.",Icariin suppresses cell cycle transition and cell migration in ovarian cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720119,Oncology reports,2019 04 09,"Ovarian cancer is the third most common type of gynecological tumor, in addition to being the most lethal. Cytoreductive surgery with chemotherapy is the standard treatment for ovarian cancer. It is necessary to identify novel chemotherapeutic methods, since current chemotherapy treatments are rarely effective for patients with advanced‑stage or recurrent ovarian cancer and may cause acute systemic toxicity. Icariin (ICA) is a prenylated flavonol glycoside derived from Herba Epimedii, a medicinal plant with a variety of pharmacological activities, including anticancer, antidiabetic and anti‑obesity effects. By analyzing cell viability, cell cycle and cell migration, the present study demonstrated that ICA inhibited the cell viability of the ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3, and blocked cell cycle transition. ICA inhibited the expression of fuse binding protein 1 (FBP1), a critical regulator of proliferation and tumorigenesis through binding to the c‑Myc promoter, as well as β‑catenin, a key regulator in ovarian cancer initiation, metastasis, chemoresistance and recurrence. Furthermore, it was indicated that ICA inhibited the migration of SKOV3 cells. In accordance with our previous findings on high FBP1 expression in ovarian cancer, FBP1 was a potential target of ICA in ovarian cancer cells. Based on these results, the present study demonstrated that ICA may be a potential therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer treatment.",MicroRNA‑663b targets GAB2 to restrict cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720118,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Previous studies have demonstrated that numerous tumor‑specific microRNAs (miRNAs) are upregulated or downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and that their dysregulation is implicated in HCC occurrence and development. Therefore, investigation of crucial miRNAs involved in HCC oncogenesis and progression may provide novel insights into the therapy of patients with this malignant tumor. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assays were performed to detect tissue and cellular expression levels of miRNA‑663b (miR‑663b) in HCC. The effects of miR‑663b overexpression on the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells were examined using Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Transwell invasion assays, respectively. The direct target of miR‑663b in HCC cells was determined by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. It was observed that miR‑663b was expressed at low levels in HCC tissues and cell lines. miR‑663b upregulation suppressed the proliferative and invasive abilities of HCC cells. Additionally, Grb2‑associated binding 2 (GAB2) was regarded as a direct target gene of miR‑663b in HCC cells. Furthermore, GAB2 was overexpressed in HCC tissues, and overexpression of GAB2 was inversely correlated with levels of miR‑663b. GAB2 overexpression was able to rescue the suppressive effects of miR‑663b on HCC cells. These results demonstrated that this newly‑identified miR‑663b/GAB2 axis may be implicated in HCC occurrence and development.",Expression of protein disulfide isomerase A3 and its clinicopathological association in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720117,Oncology reports,2019 04 09,"Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3) is a chaperone protein that supports the folding and processing of synthesized proteins. Its expression is associated with the prognosis of laryngeal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, diffuse glioma and uterine cervical cancer. In the present study, the expression levels of PDIA3 and its clinicopathological association were examined in 52 cases of gastric cancer (GC). The expression of PDIA3 was examined by immunohistochemistry and scored using a semi-quantitative method. According to the score, GC samples were classified into PDIA3‑High and PDIA3‑Low GC. PDIA3‑High GC samples were predominantly of the intestinal type. Multivariate survival analysis indicated that PDIA3 expression and cancer stage were independent factors. The overall survival of PDIA3‑High GC cases was significantly favorable compared with that of PDIA3‑Low GC cases, and this was more evident in cases at an advanced stage. In GC cell cultures, the PDIA3 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins were expressed in three out of the four assessed cell lines according to western blot analysis. Notably, the expression of MHC class I was increased by the stimulation of interferon γ. Co‑immunoprecipitation assays suggested the formation of a PDIA3 and MHC class I complex. The findings suggested that PDIA3 may be involved in the immune response of carcinoma cells. The improved prognosis in PDIA3‑High GC may be accounted for, in part, by sufficient antigen processing and expression of MHC class I, which can be mediated by PDIA3. It was suggested that PDIA3 serves an important role in the pathobiology of GC, and that PDIA3 is a useful marker for the prediction of prognosis.",TSPAN1 upregulates MMP2 to promote pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion via PLCγ.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720116,Oncology reports,2019 04 09,"Pancreatic cancer (PC), a malignancy of the digestive system, has one of the highest rates of metastasis and mortality. It is characterized by the detachment, migration, implantation and infiltration of tumor cells to form metastases or recurrent foci. Tetraspanin 1 (TSPAN1), a novel member of the TSPAN superfamily, is highly expressed in many types of cancer, including gastric, colon, liver and esophageal cancer. It has also been associated with lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the role of TSPAN1 in PC has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of TSPAN1 in human PC tissue samples and cell lines. Additionally, the functions of TSPAN1 in PC cell migration and invasion were assessed. The protein and gene expression of TSPAN1 was analyzed in clinical PC tissue samples and human PC cell lines (SW1990, BxPC3, Capan1 and PANC‑1) via immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The effect of TSPAN1 downregulation and overexpression in PC cells, via transfection with siRNA and pLNCX‑TSPAN1‑cDNA recombinant plasmid, respectively, on cell invasion and migration were assessed. Additionally, the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2) and MMP9 were determined. In clinical PC tissue samples, the expression of TSPAN1 was markedly increased when compared with normal pancreatic tissue samples. TSPAN1 was also highly expressed in PC cell lines compared with HPDE, a normal pancreatic cell line. Transfection with siRNA targeting TSPAN1 in PC cell lines significantly suppressed PC cell migration and invasion, and downregulated the expression of MMP2. However, there was no effect on MMP9. Consistently, PC cell migration and invasion together with MMP2 mRNA expression were markedly increased following TSPAN1 ectopic overexpression. The present study utilized small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeted to phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) to demonstrate that TSPAN1 siRNA suppressed PC cell migration and invasion, and MMP2 mRNA expression by blocking the translocation and phosphorylation of PLCγ. The results of the present study revealed that TSPAN1 has an important function in human PC cell migration and invasion by modulating MMP2 expression via PLCγ. Thus, the results indicate that the silencing of TSPAN1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PC.",miR‑155 mediates inflammatory injury of hippocampal neuronal cells via the activation of microglia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720115,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"MicroRNA (miR)‑155 has a crucial role in various cellular functions, including differentiation of hematopoietic cells, immunization, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the roles and mechanisms of miR‑155 in treatment‑resistant depression (TRD). A Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and flow cytometry were performed to assess the cell viability and apoptosis of microglial cells, respectively. Western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to evaluate the associated protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The results revealed that miR‑155 reduced the cell viability of BV‑2 microglial cells, and miR‑155 enhanced the expression levels of pro‑inflammatory cytokines in BV‑2 microglial cells. Furthermore, conditioned medium from miR‑155‑treated microglia decreased the cell viability of HT22 hippocampal cells. miR‑155‑treated microglia increased the apoptosis of neuronal hippocampal cells by modulating the expression levels of apoptosis regulator Bax, apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2, pro‑caspase‑3 and cleaved‑caspase‑3. The cell cycle distribution was disrupted by miR‑155‑treated microglia through induction of S phase arrest. Furthermore, the overexpression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 reversed the pro‑apoptotic effect of activated microglia on hippocampal neuronal cells. In conclusion, the present results suggested that miR‑155 mediated the inflammatory injury in hippocampal neuronal cells by activating the microglial cells. The potential effects of miR‑155 on the activation of microglial cells suggest that miR‑155 may be an effective target for TRD therapies."

The mice were divided into five groups: Regular diet; high fat diet; simvastatin‑treated; and low and high dose TMP‑treated groups. The results demonstrated that, compared with the control group, serum glucose, total cholesterol (TC) and low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased in the model group. Additionally, compared with the model group, simvastatin lowered the TC level, whereas TMP did not. Compared with the control group, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver tissue was increased and the level of glutathione peroxidase (GSH‑pX) in the liver tissue was decreased in the model group. Furthermore, compared with the model group, TMP decreased the level of MDA and increased the level of GSH‑Px; however, simvastatin did not have these effects. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed; the results showed that, compared with the control group, the levels of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6) in the liver tissue were increased, and the ratio of phosphorylated (p)‑nuclear factor κB (NF‑κB)/NF‑κB was also increased in the model group. The addition of TMP and simvastatin demonstrated that, compared with the model group, the inflammatory factor levels and the ratio of p‑NF‑κB/NF‑κB were decreased. In addition, liver lipid deposition was examined in the model group using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Oil Red O staining, and the results showed that TMP and simvastatin reduced liver lipid deposition. Furthermore, compared with the control group, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the liver tissue was increased. Compared with that in the model group, TMP and simvastatin decreased the ROS level. In conclusion, TMP, similar to simvastatin, exerted a notable hepatoprotective effect on mice fed a high fat diet with non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease, by inhibiting inflammatory factors and the p‑NF‑κB/ROS signaling pathway.","Differences in the distribution of CD20, CD3, CD34 and CD45RO in nasal mucosa and polyps from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720103,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"The present study focused on the assessment of the inflammatory infiltrate that characterizes nasal polyps in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. Inflammatory cell type was determined using specific markers. This evaluation was made possible by determining the expression of the following markers: CD20, a marker of B lymphocytes [using activated T cells (ATC) armed with CD20 antibody]; CD3, a marker of T lymphocytes (using ATC armed with anti‑CD3 antibody); CD45, the leukocyte common antigen (using ATC armed with anti‑CD45 antibody; and CD34, for the microvasculature of the nasal polyp (using anti‑CD34 antibody). The diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) was made according to current EPOS guidelines based on patient history, clinical examination and nasal endoscopy. We examined surgically resected nasal polyps from 127 patients diagnosed with CRSwNP, who benefited from surgical procedures at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of our institution. The polyps were analyzed at the Department of Pathology of our institution utilizing histopathological and immunohistochemical methods as follows: Firstly, the tissues were paraffin‑impregnated, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. We then examined the expression of CD3, CD20, CD34 and CD45RO by immunohistochemistry with soluble labeled streptavidin biotin (LSAB)/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) complexes. We observed the following histopathological changes: The structure of the epithelium was evidenced by collagenous subjacent stroma with mixed areas, sometimes associated with hyaline zones. In all types of polyps, we also observed a diffuse underlayer or periglandular lymphoplasmacytic in filtrate composed predominantly from T lymphocytes and eosinophils. The histopathological changes suggest the chronic inflammation of the sinus mucosa, which was diffusely distributed in allergic polyps and with nodular distribution in fibro‑inflammatory polyps. The number of B lymphocytes was greater in the fibro‑inflammatory polyps. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate that the inflammatory infiltrate in nasal polyps from patients with CRSwNP is mainly composed of T cells and eosinophils in all types of polyposis. In addition, a diffuse distribution of allergic polyps and the nodular distribution of fibro‑inflammatory polyps, and the hyperplasia of the seromucous glands was observed. The determination of CD20, CD3, CD34 and CD45RO could be used to assess the inflammatory infiltrate of the nasal poplyps in these patients.",Autophagy and apoptotic machinery caused by Polygonum cuspidatum extract in cisplatin‑resistant human oral cancer CAR cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720102,Oncology reports,2019 04 09,"Polygonum cuspidatum (Hu Zhang) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and has been revealed to exert anticancer, anti‑angiogenesis, anti‑human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anti‑hepatitis B virus, anti‑microbial, anti‑inflammatory, and neuro‑protective bio‑activities. However, the effect of P. cuspidatum extract (PCE) on drug‑resistant human oral cancer cells regarding cell death is not fully understood yet. The present study was undertaken to explore the induction of autophagic and apoptotic cell death and to investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms in PCE‑treated cisplatin‑resistant human oral cancer CAR cells. Our results revealed that PCE was determined via HPLC analytic method, and it was revealed that resveratrol may be a major compound in PCE. The data also demonstrated that PCE reduced CAR cell viability in a concentration‑ and time‑dependent response via an MTT assay. PCE had an extremely low toxicity in human normal gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Autophagic and apoptotic cell death was found after PCE treatment by morphological determination. PCE was revealed to induce autophagy as determined using acridine orange (AO), LC3‑GFP, monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and LysoTracker Red staining in CAR cells. In addition, PCE was revealed to induce apoptosis in CAR cells via 4',6‑diamidino‑2‑phenylindole (DAPI)/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‑end labeling (TUNEL) double staining. PCE significantly stimulated caspase‑9 and ‑3 activities as revealed using caspase activity assays. PCE markedly increased the protein levels of Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Beclin‑1, LC3, Bax and cleaved caspase‑3, while it decreased the protein expression of Bcl‑2 in CAR cells as determined by western blotting. In conclusion, our findings are the first to suggest that PCE may be potentially efficacious for the treatment of cisplatin‑resistant human oral cancer.","Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of critical lncRNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs in non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720100,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common fatty liver disease in developed countries, in which fat accumulation in the liver is induced by non‑alcoholic factors.

Using the clusterProfiler package and Cytoscape software, enrichment and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted to evaluate the DE‑mRNAs. Next, the miRNA‑lncRNA‑mRNA interaction network was visualized using Cytoscape software. Additionally, RP11‑279F6.1 and AC004540.4 expression levels were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. There were 318 DE‑lncRNAs and 609 DE‑mRNAs identified in the NAFLD tissues compared with the normal tissues. Jun proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (JUN), which is regulated by AC004540.4 and RP11‑279F6.1, exhibited higher degree compared with other nodes in the PPI network. Furthermore, miR‑409‑3p and miR‑139 (targeting JUN) were predicted as PPI network nodes. In the miRNA‑lncRNA‑mRNA network, miR‑20a and B‑cell lymphoma 2‑like 11 (BCL2L11) were among the top 10 nodes. Additionally, BCL2L11, AC004540.4 and RP11‑279F6.1 were targeted by miR‑20a, miR‑409‑3p and miR‑139 in the miRNA‑lncRNA‑mRNA network, respectively. RP11‑279F6.1 and AC004540.4 expression was markedly enhanced in NAFLD liver tissues. These key RNAs may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of NAFLD.",10‑Hydroxycamptothecin induces apoptosis in human fibroblasts by regulating miRNA‑23b‑3p expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720099,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"10‑Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) effectively controls epidural fibrosis, but the exact underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous. Abnormal microRNA (miR)‑23b‑3p expression has been detected in various types of fibrotic tissues that are present in different diseases. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms through which HCPT induces fibroblast apoptosis. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reactions were performed on six traumatic scar samples and matched normal skin samples; traumatic scar formation was revealed to be significantly inversely associated with miR‑23b‑3p expression. In addition, the miR‑23b‑3p expression level in human fibroblasts was examined following HCPT treatment. The effects of HCPT and miR‑23b‑3p on fibroblast apoptosis were assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl‑transferase‑mediated dUTP nick‑end labeling, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that HCPT treatment notably increased miR‑23b‑3p expression levels and accelerated fibroblast apoptosis. Therefore, upregulation of miR‑23b‑3p expression was demonstrated to promote fibroblast apoptosis, consistently with the effects of HCPT. The results of the present study indicated that HCPT may induce fibroblast apoptosis by regulating miR‑23b‑3p expression.",RNA sequencing discloses the genome‑wide profile of long noncoding RNAs in dilated cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720098,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common type of non‑ischemic cardiomyopathy, of which the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to serve crucial physiological roles in various cardiac diseases. However, the genome‑wide expression profile of lncRNAs remains to be elucidated in DCM. In the present study, a case‑control study was performed to identify expression deviations in circulating lncRNAs between patients with DCM and controls by RNA sequencing. Partial dysregulated lncRNAs were validated by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, and lncRNA‑messenger RNA (mRNA) co‑expression network analyses were employed to probe potential functions of these dysregulated lncRNAs in DCM. Comparison between 8 DCM and 8 control samples demonstrated that there were alterations in the expression levels of 988 lncRNAs and 1,418 mRNAs in total. The dysregulated lncRNAs were found to be mainly associated with system development, organ morphogenesis and metabolic regulation in terms of 'biological processes'. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the gap junction pathway, phagosome, and dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathways may serve crucial roles in the development of DCM. The lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network also suggested that the target genes of the lncRNAs were different in patients with DCM as compared with those in the controls. In conclusion, the present study revealed the genome‑wide profile of circulating lncRNAs in DCM by RNA sequencing, and explored the potential functions of these lncRNAs in DCM using bioinformatics analysis. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of lncRNAs in DCM.",Preliminary study on the role of miR‑148a and DNMT1 in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720097,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"MicroRNA (miR)‑148a is differentially expressed in numerous malignant tumors and it was identified to regulate tumor growth, cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and drug resistance via the regulation of the expression levels of its target genes. However, the biological function of miR‑148a in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. In the present study, the expression levels of miR‑148a and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting. Methylation‑specific PCR was used to detect the methylation levels in the miR‑148a promoter. The effects of miR‑148a on cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting kit‑8 or flow cytometry assays, respectively. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was performed to investigate the association between miR‑148a and DNMT1. Patients with AML exhibited an increased expression level of miR‑148a, whereas the expression level of DNMT1 was identified to be decreased compared with healthy control subjects. In AML cell lines, the methylation state of miR‑148 promoter was significantly increased compared with normal cells. Following knockdown of DNMT1 in U937 cells, the expression level of miR‑148a increased significantly, whereas the methylation level of the miR‑148a promoter decreased. The mRNA and protein expression levels of DNMT1 decreased following transfection with miR‑148a mimics in U937 cells. Conversely, transfection with miR‑148a inhibitor in Kasumi‑1 cells led to an increase in the expression level of DNMT. Dual‑luciferase reporter assays suggested that DNMT1 was one of the direct target genes of miR‑148a. Overexpression of miR‑148a inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Inhibition of DNMT1 led to a decreased methylation level of the 5'‑cytosine‑phosphate‑guanine‑3' islands in the miR‑148a promoter, thus increasing the expression level of miR‑148a. DNMT1 was identified to be a downstream target of miR‑148a, and was negatively regulated by miR‑148a in AML cell lines, suggesting that miR‑148a and DNMT1 form a mutual negative feedback loop.",Integrative analysis of cancer driver genes in prostate adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720096,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Large‑scale genomics studies have identified recurrently mutated genes in the ETS gene family, including fusions and copy number variations (CNVs), which are involved in the development of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). However, the aetiology of PRAD remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, 333 driver genes were identified using four computational tools: OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, iCAGES and DrGaP. In addition, 32 driver pathways were identified using DrGaP. SPOP, TP53, SPTA1, AHNAK, HMCN1, ATM, FOXA1, CSMD3, LRP1B and FREM2 were the 10 most recurrently mutated genes in PRAD. ITGAL, TAGAP, SIGLEC10, RAC2 and ITGA4 were the five hub genes in the yellow module that were associated with the number of positive lymph nodes. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 20 driver genes with the most frequent CNVs revealed three clusters of patients with PRAD. Cluster 3 tumours exhibited significantly higher numbers of positive lymph nodes, higher Gleason scores, more advanced cancer stages and poorer prognosis than cluster 1 and 2 tumours. A total of 48 genes were significantly associated with the number of positive lymph nodes, Gleason scores and pathologic stage in patients with PRAD. The identified set of cancer genes and pathways sheds light on the tumorigenesis of PRAD and creates avenues for the development of prognostic biomarkers and driver gene‑targeted therapies in PRAD.",Comprehensive circular RNA expression profiles in a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720095,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Recent studies have revealed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the development of various liver diseases. However, the regulatory role of circRNAs in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the circRNA profiles in a NASH mouse model were investigated, and their functions in NASH were predicted using bioinformatics analysis, with the aim of providing novel clues for delineating the mechanisms of action. A NASH mouse model was established by feeding mice with a methionine and choline‑deficient diet. The liver circRNA profile was screened using a circRNA microarray, and the differentially expressed circRNAs were verified by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, circRNA‑microRNA (miRNA) interactions were predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to annotate the biological functions of host linear transcripts of circRNA. A total of 450 circRNAs were revealed to be dysregulated, with 298 circRNAs upregulated and 152 circRNAs downregulated in the NASH model mice. circRNA_29981 was identified as a significantly differentially expressed circRNA. The results from the circRNA‑miRNA pathway interaction analysis revealed that circRNA_29981 was a potential regulator of hepatic stellate cell activation. The host linear transcripts were also analyzed, and the top 10 enriched GO entries and KEGG pathways were annotated. These findings suggested that circRNAs may be important regulators of NASH. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that the circRNA profile in NASH may provide potential candidates for future studies aimed at elucidating the pathogenic mechanism(s) involved in the disease.",Aberrant expression of sperm‑specific glycolytic enzymes are associated with poor sperm quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720094,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"The energy required for normal sperm function is mainly generated by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Testis‑specific glycolytic enzymes are expressed in germ cells and present in mature spermatozoa. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between aberrant expression of glycolytic enzymes and human sperm quality. In silico analysis of glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase, testis‑specific (GAPDHS), phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHC) identified that they were exclusively expressed in post‑meiotic germ cells and this was validated in human testes using immunohistochemistry. Compared with the testes of young adults, markedly lower expression levels of these glycolytic enzymes were observed in the testes of elderly adults. Similarly, low levels were observed in immature and asthenozoospermic spermatozoa. The expression levels of GAPDHS, PGK2 and LDHC in the spermatozoa were closely correlated with progressive sperm motility. The results indicated that the expression of GAPDHS, PGK2 and LDHC in sperm may be associated with sperm quality, and there may be a similar molecular mechanism underlying sperm quality in immature and asthenozoospermic spermatozoa. This study reveals a close association of glycolytic enzymes with sperm quality. The data may greatly contribute to the molecular evaluation of sperm quality and the diagnosis and treatment of asthenozoospermia."

The plasmid pGCsilencerU6/GFP/Neo‑RNAi‑ARK5 and the control vector with a scramble sequence were transfected into SKOV3 cells to establish ARK5‑deficient SKOV3 cells (siARK5/SKOV3) and a control cell line (Scr/SKOV3), respectively. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) and Western blot analysis were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of ARK5. Migration and invasion abilities of SKOV3 cells were determined in chemotaxis and invasion assays, respectively. The epidermal growth factor‑1 (EGF‑1)‑induced expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9, epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) in siARK5/SKOV3 and Scr/SKOV3 cells were detected by western blot. RT‑PCR and western blot analyses demonstrated that the expression of ARK5 was significantly downregulated in siARK5/SKOV3 cells at the mRNA and protein levels (P<0.01). The migration and invasion abilities of siARK5/SKOV3 cells were markedly decreased compared with Scr/SKOV3 cells (P<0.01). In addition, the results demonstrated that EGF‑1‑induced expression of MMP‑2 and MMP‑9, EMT and phosphorylation of mTOR were suppressed in siARK5/SKOV3 cells as compared with Scr/SKOV3 cells (P<0.01). The current study demonstrated that ARK5 is a critical factor involved in SKOV3 cell invasion and ARK5 increases invasive potential by promoting EMT and activating the Akt‑mTOR‑MMPs pathway.",Simultaneous detection of target CNVs and SNVs of thalassemia by multiplex PCR and next‑generation sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720081,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Thalassemia is caused by complex mechanisms, including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). The CNV types of α‑thalassemia are typically detected by gap‑polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The SNV types are detected by Sanger sequencing. In the present study, a novel method was developed that simultaneously detects CNVs and SNVs by multiplex PCR and next‑generation sequencing (NGS). To detect CNVs, 33 normal samples were used as a cluster of control values to build a baseline, and the A, B, C, and D ratios were developed to evaluate‑SEA, ‑α4.2, ‑α3.7, and compound or homozygous CNVs, respectively. To detect other SNVs, sequencing data were analyzed using the system's software and annotated using Annovar software. In a test of performance, 128 patients with thalassemia were detected using the method developed and were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and gap‑PCR. Four different CNV types were clearly distinguished by the developed algorithm, with ‑SEA, ‑α3.7, ‑α4.2, and compound or homozygous deletions. The sensitivities for each CNV type were 96.72% (59/61), 97.37% (37/38), 83.33% (10/12) and 95% (19/20), and the specificities were 93.94% (32/33), 93.94% (32/33), 100% (33/33) and 100% (33/33), respectively. The SNVs detected were consistent with those of the Sanger sequencing.",BP‑1‑102 exerts an antitumor effect on the AGS human gastric cancer cell line through modulating the STAT3 and MAPK signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720080,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"BP‑1‑102, a novel inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), exhibits significant antitumor effects in several malignancies in vitro and in vivo. However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the effect and potential molecular mechanisms of BP‑102 in human GC cell lines were investigated. The results showed that BP‑1‑02 dose‑dependently inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells, whereas it had little effect on HGC‑27 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that BP‑1‑102 induced apoptosis, but had minimal effect on cell cycle distribution. In addition, cells treated with BP‑1‑102 demonstrated markedly suppressed migration and invasion capacities. Western blot analysis revealed that BP‑1‑102 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its target genes, including c‑Myc, cyclin D1 and survivin, in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Furthermore, it was found that BP‑1‑102 induced the phosphorylation of c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibited the activation of extracellular signal‑related kinases. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BP‑1‑102 may be a potent antitumor agent that acts through modulating the STAT3 and MAPK signaling pathways in GC cells.",Expression and role of TNIP2 in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following severe trauma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720079,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Severe trauma can result in secondary multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Inflammation response and oxidative stress promote the occurrence and development of MODS. TNFAIP3‑interacting protein 2 (TNIP2), which can repress the activation of nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) and may be involved in MODS progression, has not been studied in regards to MODS. The present study aimed to investigate the expression, role and mechanism of TNIP2 in MODS following severe trauma. The expression level of TNIP2 was initially detected in the blood of patients with MODS using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay. Then, to investigate the role of TNIP2 in MODS, a MODS rat model was conducted by trauma and the model rats were treated with TNIP2‑plasmid (intraperitoneal injection). Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine (Cr) and creatine kinase (CK); and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α), high‑mobility group box 1 (HMGB‑1), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the different groups were assessed. In addition, activation of NF‑κB was assessed by detecting the level of phospho‑p65. The results showed that TNIP2 was significantly decreased in the blood of patients with MODS. TNIP2 was also significantly downregulated in the blood and the pulmonary, renal and hepatic tissues of MODS rats. The levels of ALT, AST, LDH, BUN, Cr and CK were markedly increased in the blood of MODS rats, and these increases were inhibited by TNIP2‑plasmid administration. Moreover, blood levels of TNF‑α, HMGB‑1 and MDA were significantly increased in MODS rats, while TAC was notably decreased, and these changes were prevented by TNIP2‑plasmid administration. Furthermore, it was found that activation of NF‑κB induced by MODS was eliminated by TNIP2‑plasmid. In conclusion, the data indicated that TNIP2 is significantly decreased in MODS following severe trauma, and it plays a protective role in MODS development by inhibiting the inflammation response and oxidative stress by preventing NF‑κB activation.",Functional genetic variants of the GATA4 gene promoter in acute myocardial infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720078,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Coronary artery disease (CAD), including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is a common complex disease; however, the genetic causes remain largely unknown. Recent epidemiological investigations indicated that the incidence of CAD in patients with congenital heart diseases is markedly higher than that observed in healthy controls. It was therefore hypothesized that the dysregulated expression of cardiac developmental genes may be involved in CAD development. GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) serves essential roles in heart development and coronary vessel formation. In the present study, the GATA4 gene promoter was analyzed in patients with AMI (n=395) and in ethnically‑matched healthy controls (n=397). A total of 14 DNA variants were identified, including two single‑nucleotide polymorphisms. Three novel heterozygous DNA variants (g.31806C>T, g.31900G>C and g.32241C>T) were reported in three patients with AMI. These DNA variants significantly increased the activity of the GATA4 gene promoter. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the DNA variant g.32241C>T influenced the binding ability of transcription factors. Taken together, the DNA variants may alter GATA4 gene promoter activity and affect GATA4 levels, thus contributing to AMI development.",Lysyl oxidase assists tumor‑initiating cells to enhance angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720077,International journal of oncology,2019 04 09,"A highly tumorigenic and malignant sub‑population of HCC containing tumor‑initiating cells (TICs) are defined by high self‑renewal and sphere formation ability. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) regulates various factors involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance, migration and angiogenesis. Certain reports have demonstrated the role of LOX in ECM crosslinking, however, the cancer‑promoting effects of LOX in HCC remain unclear, and whether LOX has a role in the regulation of angiogenesis in HCC TICs has not been elucidated. In the current study, RNA sequencing using next‑generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses revealed that LOX gene expression was significantly upregulated in cell spheres. Sphere cells may form tumors with more vascular enrichment compared with tumors produced from adherent cells, as observed in a mouse xenograft model. LOX expression is correlated with increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet‑derived growth factor, as demonstrated by analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Conditioned media obtained from LOX‑overexpressing tumor cells stimulated angiogenesis via secreted VEGF and enhanced the tube formation capacity of endothelial cells. Furthermore, these functional behaviors were blocked by the LOX inhibitor β‑aminopropionitrile. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the pivotal role of LOX in the regulation of TICs in HCC. Combination of LOX inhibitor with sorafenib is a potentially advantageous strategy for HCC therapy.",circRNA‑miRNA association for coronary heart disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720076,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and an important public health problem globally, but the mechanism of CHD is still complex and unclear. The purpose of the current study was to explore the mechanism underlying CHD using high‑throughput technology. The study participants were patients with coronary angiography (CAG)‑proven severity of coronary artery stenosis. Patients were divided into control and test group based on specific inclusion criteria, and data were collected regarding the results of routine inspection and the Gensini score (GS). We explored the mechanism underlying CHD with high‑throughput integration of circular RNA (circRNA)‑microRNA (miRNA) data. Through the expression of circRNA‑miRNA, we discovered a total of 110 circRNAs to be differentially expressed in the two groups. Of these, 73 were upregulated and 37 downregulated in the CHD (fold ≥2.0 and P<0.05). Among 18 miRNAs, 13 were upregulated and 5 were downregulated in the CHD group (fold ≥2.0 and P<0.05). Enrichment analysis showed that circRNAs participate in a variety of disease development processes, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and pathways (P<0.05). The mechanism underlying CHD may be closely related to up‑ or downregulated circRNA and miRNA and co‑expression of circRNA‑miRNA specifically involved regulate multiple pathways and multiple cellular and molecular biological processes.",Insulin‑like growth factor I promotes adipogenesis in hemangioma stem cells from infantile hemangiomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720075,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are the most common infantile neoplasms and are characterized by initial proliferation during infancy and subsequent spontaneous regression within the next 5‑10 years, frequently leaving fibrous fat residues. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the differentiation of hemangioma stem cells (HemSCs) into adipocytes are not clear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of insulin‑like growth factor I (IGF‑1) on HemSCs from patients with IH and to determine the signaling mechanisms involved. Treatment of HemSCs with IGF‑1 led to upregulation of the protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ (PPARγ). By contrast, inhibition of the IGF‑1 receptor (IGF‑1R) or phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K) activity decreased the expression of PPARγ, in addition to that of CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein (C/EBP)α, C/EBPβ, and adiponectin. IGF‑1 upregulated the expression of phosphorylated RAC‑α serine/threonine‑protein kinase in IH cells, whereas a specific PI3K inhibitor or IGF‑1R antibody blocked this effect. These results indicated that IGF‑1 is a pro‑proliferative and pro‑lipogenic factor in IH HemSCs. Taken together, these findings indicated that IGF‑1 is able to upregulate PPARγ by activating the IGF‑1R and PI3K pathways, thereby accelerating lipogenesis and enhancing IH HemSC adipogenesis.",Expression of TRB3 promotes epithelial‑mesenchymal transition of MLE‑12 murine alveolar type II epithelial cells through the TGF‑β1/Smad3 signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720074,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the expression of tribbles pseudokinase 3 (TRB3) is involved in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and to examine the possible mechanisms. The expression of TRB3 in murine alveolar type II epithelial cells (MLE‑12 cells) following transforming growth factor β1 (TGF‑β1) stimulation was assessed using various techniques, including western blot and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. TRB3 overexpression and downregulation models were used to evaluate the impact of TRB3 on the TGF‑β1‑induced epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MLE‑12 cells. The downregulation of TRB3 was induced by RNA interference. The expression of TRB3 was significantly increased in MLE‑12 cells following the activation of TGF‑β1 (P<0.05). The overexpression of TRB3 was found to promote activation of the TGF‑β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, EMT, and the upregulated expression of β‑catenin and EMT‑related genes and proteins (P<0.05), whereas the downregulation of TRB3 attenuated the promoting effect on EMT induced by TGF‑β1. In addition, the overexpression of TRB3 inhibited MLE‑12 cell proliferation by stimulating apoptosis, leading to the formation of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The positive feedback loop demonstrated that TGF‑β1 induced the expression of TRB3, and TRB3, in turn, stimulated EMT and promoted the onset of PF through activation of the TGF‑β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Therefore, TRB3 may promote the formation of PF through the TGF‑β1/Smad3 signaling pathway.","Effects of varying radiation dosages on MMP1 expression, and MMP1 knockdown on the viability and migration of SW620 cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720073,Molecular medicine reports,2019 04 09,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, is one of the leading causes of cancer‑associated mortality worldwide at present. The aim of the present study was to detect the effects of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) on the viability and migration of a CRC cell line in the presence or absence of variation X‑ray radiation doses. The CRC cell line, SW620, was cultured and treated with different X‑ray doses (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 Gy). MMP1 expression was downregulated via the application of a specific small interfering (si)‑RNA. The viability and migration of SW620 cells prior to and following transfection were detected with MTT and Transwell chamber assays, respectively. The application of siRNA transfection to silence MMP1 in SW620 cells resulted in reduced cell viability and migration (P<0.05). Compared with the control, the cell viability and migration of cells were significantly reduced when exposed to 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 Gy X‑ray radiation (P<0.05). In SW620 cells treated with different X‑ray doses, the mRNA expression levels of MMP1 were significantly reduced (P<0.05). Cells treated with 0.5 Gy X‑ray exposure exhibited the lowest mRNA expression levels of MMP1 when compared with other doses of X‑ray radiation. The expression of MMP1 was associated with the promotion of the viability and migration of SW620 cells. X‑ray radiation with 6 Gy dosages significantly reduced cell viability when compared with the control. Thus, MMP1‑targeted therapy combined with radiotherapy could be used for treating CRC."

Previous studies have demonstrated that metformin can act alone or in synergy with certain anticancer agents to achieve anti‑neoplastic effects on various types of tumors via adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. However, the role of metformin in AMPK‑mediated apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells is poorly understood. In the current study, metformin exhibited a potent anti‑proliferative effect and induced apoptotic characteristics in human AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells, as demonstrated by MTT assay, morphological observation method, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and caspase‑3/7 assay kits. Western blot analysis demonstrated that treatment with metformin increased the phosphorylation of AMPK, and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and p70S6k. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) suppressed AMPK phosphorylation and significantly abrogated the effects of metformin on AGS cell viability. Metformin also reduced the phosphorylation of mitogen‑activated protein kinases (ERK, JNK and p38). Additionally, metformin significantly increased the cellular ROS level and included loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Metformin altered apoptosis‑associated signaling to downregulate the BAD phosphorylation and Bcl‑2, pro‑caspase‑9, pro‑caspase‑3 and pro‑caspase‑7 expression, and to upregulate BAD, cytochrome c, and Apaf‑1 proteins levels in AGS cells. Furthermore, z‑VAD‑fmk (a pan‑caspase inhibitor) was used to assess mitochondria‑mediated caspase‑dependent apoptosis in metformin‑treated AGS cells. The findings demonstrated that metformin induced AMPK‑mediated apoptosis, making it appealing for development as a novel anticancer drug for the treating gastric cancer.",Bioinformatic analysis of next‑generation sequencing data to identify dysregulated genes in fibroblasts of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720061,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal fibrotic lung disease with an increasing global burden. It is hypothesized that fibroblasts have a number of functions that may affect the development and progression of IPF. However, the present understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with fibroblasts in IPF remains limited. The present study aimed to identify the dysregulated genes in IPF fibroblasts, elucidate their functions and explore potential microRNA (miRNA)‑mRNA interactions. mRNA and miRNA expression profiles were obtained from IPF fibroblasts and normal lung fibroblasts using a next‑generation sequencing platform, and bioinformatic analyses were performed in a step‑wise manner. A total of 42 dysregulated genes (>2 fold‑change of expression) were identified, of which 5 were verified in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database analysis, including the upregulation of neurotrimin (NTM), paired box 8 (PAX8) and mesoderm development LRP chaperone, and the downregulation of ITPR interacting domain containing 2 and Inka box actin regulator 2 (INKA2). Previous data indicated that PAX8 and INKA2 serve roles in cell growth, proliferation and survival. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the most significant function of these 42 dysregulated genes was associated with the composition and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A total of 60 dysregulated miRNAs were also identified, and 1,908 targets were predicted by the miRmap database. The integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression data, combined with GEO verification, finally identified Homo sapiens (hsa)‑miR‑1254‑INKA2 and hsa‑miR‑766‑3p‑INKA2 as the potential miRNA‑mRNA interactions in IPF fibroblasts. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that dysregulation of PAX8, hsa‑miR‑1254‑INKA2 and hsa‑miR‑766‑3p‑INKA2 may promote the proliferation and survival of IPF fibroblasts. In the functional analysis of the dysregulated genes, a marked association between fibroblasts and the ECM was identified. These data improve the current understanding of fibroblasts as key cells in the pathogenesis of IPF. As a screening study using bioinformatics approaches, the results of the present study require additional validation.",NR2F2 loss‑of‑function mutation is responsible for congenital bicuspid aortic valve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720060,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) represents the most common type of cardiac birth defect affecting 0.4‑2% of the general population, and accounts for a markedly increased incidence of life‑threatening complications, including valvulopathy and aortopathy. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the genetic basis of BAV. However, the genetic basis for BAV in the majority of cases remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the coding regions and splicing donors/acceptors of the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2 (NR2F2) gene, which encodes a transcription factor essential for proper cardiovascular development, were sequenced in 176 unrelated cases of congenital BAV. The available family members of the proband carrying an identified NR2F2 mutation and 280 unrelated, sex‑ and ethnicity‑matched healthy individuals as controls were additionally genotyped for NR2F2. The functional effect of the mutation was characterized using a dual‑luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, a novel heterozygous NR2F2 mutation, NM_021005.3: c.288C>A; p.(Cys96*), was identified in a family with BAV, which was transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode with complete penetrance. The nonsense mutation was absent from the 560 control chromosomes. Functional analysis identified that the mutant NR2F2 protein had no transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic transcriptional activation between NR2F2 and transcription factor GATA‑4, another transcription factor that is associated with BAV. These findings suggested NR2F2 as a novel susceptibility gene of human BAV, which reveals a novel molecular pathogenesis underpinning BAV.",MicroRNA‑199a‑5p functions as a tumor suppressor in oral squamous cell carcinoma via targeting the IKKβ/NF‑κB signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720059,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to have a significant role in the progression of several types of cancer, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the biological function and regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in OSCC remain to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miRNAs in OSCC and the relevant mechanism. Using a microarray, it was found that miRNA (miR)‑199a‑5p was one of the most downregulated miRNAs in OSCC tissues. A low expression of miR‑199a‑5p was closely associated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, tumor‑node‑metastasis stage, and overall survival rate. Functionally, the overexpression of miR‑199a‑5p suppressed cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and promoted the apoptosis of Tca8113 and SCC‑4 cells. Subsequently, inhibitor of nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) kinase β (IKKβ), an important regulator of NF‑κB activation, was identified as a direct target of miR‑199‑5p. An inverse correlation was found between miR‑199a‑5p and IKKβ in tumor tissues. Further investigations revealed that the overexpression of IKKβ efficiently abrogated the influences caused by the overexpression of miR‑199a‑5p. It was also found that the miR‑199a‑5p‑mediated anticancer effects were dependent on the inhibition of NF‑κB activation. These findings indicate that miR‑199a‑5p functions as a tumor suppressor through regulation of the NF‑κB pathway by targeting IKKβ in OSCC.",Salidroside protects PC-12 cells against amyloid β-induced apoptosis by activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720058,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most frequent diseases in elderly people and causes high mortality. Its incidence is increasing annually and no effective therapeutic treatment currently exists. In the present study, salidroside, a major active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea, was able to protect PC‑12 cells from the toxicity and apoptosis induced by AD inducer amyloid (A)β1‑42. Salidroside significantly protected PC‑12 cells by inhibiting Aβ1‑42‑induced cytotoxicity and mitochondria‑mediated endogenous caspase apoptotic pathways. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that salidroside significantly activated the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways. This observation was further confirmed using the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the AKT inhibitor LY294002, which demonstrated that salidroside promoted PC‑12 cell survival and proliferation by activating the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways. Salidroside is a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD and provides a basis for further drug development.",miR-183 modulated cell proliferation and apoptosis in ovarian cancer through the TGF-β/Smad4 signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720057,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"An increasing body of evidence has revealed that the aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is involved in the development and progression of ovarian cancer (OC). miR‑183 has been demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor and oncogene in various types of human cancers. However, the biological role of miR‑183 in OC still remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR‑183 and evaluate its underlying mechanism in OC. In the present study, miR‑183 was observed to be upregulated in OC tissues and cell lines as determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of miR‑183 on OC were further investigated via western blotting, MTT, wound healing, Transwell and immunofluorescence analyses. Downregulation of miR‑183 markedly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis in OC cells. Furthermore, it was initially confirmed that mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (Smad4) was identified as an efficient target of miR‑183 by luciferase activity assay. Finally, the results revealed that miR‑183 directly regulated biological function via the transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β/Smad4 signaling pathway in OC cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that miR‑183 exerted tumor‑promoting roles in OC, at least partially by regulating Smad4 via the TGF‑β/Smad4 signaling pathway. Therefore, miR‑183 may serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and prognosis of OC.",Partial agonistic effect of cetuximab on epidermal growth factor receptor and Src kinase activation in triple‑negative breast cancer cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720056,International journal of oncology,2019 04 09,"Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody developed to inhibit the binding of growth factors and the subsequent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) is resistant to cetuximab treatment. The aim of the present study was to examine the partial agonistic properties of cetuximab, which not only blocks ligand binding, but also partially triggers EGFR activation, which may lead to cetuximab resistance in TNBC. The phosphorylation of growth factor receptors and their signalling pathways were evaluated by determining the phosphorylation of EGFR, insulin‑like growth factor receptor (IGF‑1R), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)‑2, Src kinase, phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase (PI3K), extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and serine/threonine‑specific protein kinase (Akt) and the degradation of EGFR, and by assessing the morphology and proliferation of MDA‑MB‑231 and MDA‑MB‑468 cells. Cetuximab treatment led to the phosphorylation of EGFR, VEGFR‑2, IGF‑1R and downstream signalling molecules, Src kinase and PI3K in these cells, as well as Akt in the MDA‑MB‑231 cells. The cetuximab‑mediated phosphorylation of IGF‑1R, VEGFR‑2 and Akt was inhibited by the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, and the Src kinase inhibitor, PP2. Cetuximab treatment led to the degradation of EGFR. The cetuximab‑induced phosphorylation and EGFR degradation were less prominent compared with those induced by EGF. Cetuximab partially inhibited EGF‑mediated responses. Cetuximab, similar with EGF, altered cellular morphology in a serum‑free medium. In both cell lines, the Src kinase inhibitor enhanced the cetuximab‑induced anti‑proliferative response. These results indicate that cetuximab exerts a partial agonistic effect on EGFR, which activates Src kinase and subsequently transactivates IGF‑1R and VEGFR‑2. This partial agonistic property is likely one of the mechanisms underlying the resistance of TNBC to cetuximab.",Mitochondrial calcium: Transport and modulation of cellular processes in homeostasis and cancer (Review).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720054,International journal of oncology,2019 04 09,"In addition to their role in providing cellular energy, mitochondria fulfill a key function in cellular calcium management. The present review provides an integrative view of cellular and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, and discusses how calcium regulates mitochondrial dynamics and functionality, thus affecting various cellular processes. Calcium crosstalk exists in the domain created between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which is known as the mitochondria‑associated membrane (MAM), and controls cellular homeostasis. Calcium signaling participates in numerous biochemical and cellular processes, where calcium concentration, temporality and durability are part of a regulated, finely tuned interplay in non‑transformed cells. In addition, cancer cells modify their MAMs, which consequently affects calcium homeostasis to support mesenchymal transformation, migration, invasiveness, metastasis and autophagy. Alterations in calcium homeostasis may also support resistance to apoptosis, which is a serious problem facing current chemotherapeutic treatments. Notably, mitochondrial dynamics are also affected by mitochondrial calcium concentration to promote cancer survival responses. Dysregulated levels of mitochondrial calcium, alongside other signals, promote mitoflash generation in tumor cells, and an increased frequency of mitoflashes may induce epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition. Therefore, cancer cells remodel their calcium balance through numerous mechanisms that support their survival and growth.",Metformin prevents nephrolithiasis formation by inhibiting the expression of OPN and MCP-1 in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720053,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 04 09,"Treatment targeting osteopontin (OPN) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP‑1) has been recognized as a novel approach in renal crystal formation. The present study was designed to investigate the suppressive effects of metformin on nephrolithiasis formation and its potential mechanism. The cytotoxicity of metformin on MDCK and HK‑2 cells was determined using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay in vitro. Subsequently, the mRNA transcription and protein expression levels of MCP‑1 and OPN were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative‑polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blot analysis and ELISA. Male Sprague‑Dawley rats were divided into a control group, ethylene glycol (EG) group and EG + metformin group. The expression levels of MCP‑1 and OPN and crystal formations were evaluated in renal tissues following an 8‑week treatment period. In vitro, metformin significantly inhibited the production of MCP‑1 and OPN induced by oxalate at the mRNA and protein expression levels. In vivo, increased expression levels of MCP‑1 and OPN were detected in the EG group compared with the controls, and this upregulation was reversed in the EG + metformin group. Renal crystal deposition in the EG + metformin group was markedly decreased compared with that in the EG group. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that metformin suppressed urinary crystal deposit formation, possibly by mediating the expression of inflammatory mediators OPN and MCP‑1.",[Corrigendum] miR‑122 promotes proliferation and invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma by suppressing Forkhead box O3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720052,International journal of oncology,2019 06 03,"Following the publication of this paper, the authors have realized that two out of the three of the authors' address affiliations were not presented correctly.

Mono-substituted ketoesters have been widely used to synthesize the above compounds through asymmetric additions or substitutions. The limitations of these protocols mainly exist in the substrate scopes, and α-methyl or α-fluoro-substituted β-ketoesters or acetyl acetates are frequently used owing to their relatively higher reactivity. To break through this limitation, we employed N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed kinetic resolution to achieve the access to enantioenriched β-ketoesters with quaternary stereocenters.

Various regulatory adaptations to UV-B radiation enable plants to harvest information about fluctuations in UV-B irradiance and spectral composition in natural environments, and to defend themselves against UV-B exposure. Given that UVR8 is present across plant organs and tissues, knowledge of the systemic signalling involved in its activation and function throughout the plant is important for understanding the context of specific responses. Fine-scale understanding of both UV-B irradiance and perception within tissues and cells requires improved application of knowledge about UV-attenuation in leaves and canopies, warranting greater consideration when designing experiments. In this context, reciprocal crosstalk among photoreceptor-induced pathways also needs to be considered, as this appears to produce particularly complex patterns of physiological and morphological response. Through crosstalk, plant responses to UV-B radiation go beyond simply UV-protection or amelioration of damage, but may give cross-protection over a suite of environmental stressors. Overall, there is emerging knowledge showing how information captured by UVR8 is used to regulate molecular and physiological processes, although understanding of upscaling to higher levels of organisation, i.e. organisms, canopies and communities remains poor. Achieving this will require further studies using model plant species beyond Arabidopsis, and that represent a broad range of functional types. More attention should also be given to plants in natural environments in all their complexity, as such studies are needed to acquire an improved understanding of the impact of climate change in the context of plant-UV responses. Furthermore, broadening the scope of experiments into the regulation of plant-UV responses will facilitate the application of UV radiation in commercial plant production. By considering the progress made in plant-UV research, this perspective highlights prescient topics in plant-UV photobiology where future research efforts can profitably be focussed. This perspective also emphasises burgeoning interdisciplinary links that will assist in understanding of UV-B effects across organisational scales and gaps in knowledge that need to be filled so as to achieve an integrated vision of plant responses to UV-radiation.",Aryltrifluoromethylative cyclization of unactivated alkenes by the use of PhICF3Cl under catalyst-free conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720035,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 03 01,"A concise and catalyst-free aryltrifluoromethylative cyclization of unactivated alkenes has been developed herein.

The purpose of this randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was to evaluate the influence of daily fresh pear consumption on blood pressure (primary outcome) and other biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in middle-aged/older adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Forty men and women aged 45-65 years with MetS were included and randomly assigned to receive either two medium-sized fresh pears (Pear) or a calorie-matched control drink (Control) per day for each 12-week treatment period, each separated by a 4-week washout period. After 12 weeks of daily fresh pear consumption, systolic blood pressure tended to be reduced (130 ± 2 mmHg vs. 134 ± 2 mmHg at baseline, P = 0.07) and pulse pressure was significantly reduced (51 ± 1 vs. 54 ± 1 at baseline, P < 0.05). At 12 weeks, leptin concentrations were lower in the Pear group than Control (52.5 [7.6, 120.5] ng dL-1vs. 53.4 [5.0, 120.5] ng dL-1, respectively, P < 0.05), and there was a significant group by time interaction (P < 0.05).

Waist circumference was significantly reduced at 12 weeks in the Pear group (107.7 ± 2.0 cm vs. 108.4 ± 2 cm at baseline, P < 0.05) with a trend for a group by time interaction (P < 0.1), and significantly lower in the Pear group than Control (108.1 ± 2.0 cm vs. 108.8 ± 2 cm, P < 0.05) at 6 weeks with a significant group by time interaction (P < 0.05). Conversely, values were significantly increased at 6 weeks (108.8 ± 2 cm vs. 108.3 ± 2.0 cm at baseline, P < 0.05) in the Control group and sustained at 12 weeks. Waist-to-hip ratio was significantly reduced (0.92 ± 0.01 vs. 0.93 ± 0.01 at baseline, P < 0.05) at 12 weeks in the Pear group, and significantly lower than Control at 6 weeks (0.93 ± 0.01 vs. 0.93 ± 0.01, respectively, P < 0.05) and 12 weeks (0.92 ± 0.01 vs. 0.93 ± 0.01, P < 0.05).

In this work, hydrothermally synthesized Ce-doped BaTiO3 nanoparticles exhibited the maximum room temperature ferromagnetism (4.26 × 10-3 emu g-1) at 4 mol% due to the increase in oxygen vacancies, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron and electron spin resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Hence, the oxygen vacancy-constituted bound magnetic polaron (BMP) model was invoked to explain the enhancement in ferromagnetism. The BMP theoretical model indicated an increase in BMP magnetization (M0, 3.0 to 4.8 × 10-3 emu g-1) and true spontaneous moment per BMP (meff, 4 to 9.88 × 10-4 emu) upon Ce doping. DFT calculations showed that BMPs mediate via the Ti dz2 orbitals, leading to ferromagnetism. Besides, it is known that the magnetic moment induced by Ce at the Ba site is higher than Ce at the Ti site in the presence of oxygen vacancies. The open aperture Z-scan technique displayed the highest TPA coefficient, β (7.08 × 10-10 m W-1), and TPA cross-section, σTPA (455 × 104 GM), at 4 mol% of Ce as a result of the robust TPA-induced excited state absorption.

International guidelines agree on the use of combination of the following drugs: platelet antiplatelets, β-blockers, ACEI⁄ARBs and statins. The benefits of chronic polytherapy in reducing cardiovascular disease have been clearly shown. However, observational studies reported poor adherence to chronic polytherapy. We identified about 52,000 patients discharged from hospital with a first MI diagnosis from three Italian regions: Lazio, Toscana and Sicilia. Adherence to chronic poly-therapy in the two years after hospital discharge ranged from 63% in the Lazio region to 27% in the Sicilia region. More than 75 percent of MI patients had chronic concomitant diseases. Chronic diseases played a major role among barriers to adherence. MI patients with multimorbidity have complex health needs but, due to the current traditional disease-oriented approach, they face a highly fragmented form of care that leads to incomplete, inefficient, ineffective and possibly harmful clinical interventions, and are likely to receive complex drug regimens, which increase the risk of inappropriate prescribing, drug-drug interactions, and poor adherence. In order to address patient-specific needs, a network of multidisciplinary teams should be implemented, avoiding fragmentation and ensuring continuity of care.","[Trend analysis of suicide among children, adolescent and young adults in Ecuador between 1990 and 2017].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720006,Anales del sistema sanitario de Navarra,2019 04 25,"Analyze the long-term sex specific trends in suicide rates for Ecuadorian children, adolescents and young people, as well as to describe the evolution of the male/female ratio between 1990 and 2017.","Peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparison of Eyes of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma, and Preperimetric Glaucoma and Healthy Controls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720005,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 03 22,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess and compare peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), preperimetric glaucoma (PPG), and healthy controls with the use of Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty patients with AD, 30 patients with POAG, 30 patients with PPG, and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Only 1 randomly selected eye of each patient was analyzed. Every subject underwent a thorough ophthalmological examination and OCT of the optic disc. The peripapillary RNFL thickness in each of the 6 sectors and globally was analyzed. RESULTS The RNFL was thinnest in patients with POAG. The mean RNFL thickness value was 60.97±12.97 µm and it was significantly lower than in healthy controls (106.30±8.95 µm), patients with PPG (93.20±12.04 µm), and AD patients (95.73±13.52 µm). Mean RNFL thickness in patients with AD was significantly lower when compared to healthy controls, and was higher compared to eyes with POAG, while there were no significant differences compared to patients with PPG. CONCLUSIONS Neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS) also affects to retinal axons. A major problem is to distinguish the cause for a moderate decrease in the RNFL thickness. This is particularly true for patients with glaucoma who have not been diagnosed with changes in the visual field. It is not possible to distinguish the cause of a mild decrease in the RNFL thickness based on the SD-OCT. This may result in misdiagnosis of glaucoma, unnecessary use of anti-glaucoma eye drops, and a delayed diagnosis of AD.",COX-2/C-MET/KRAS status-based prognostic nomogram for colorectal cancer: A multicenter cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720004,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,2019 02 05,To construct quantitative prognostic models for colorectal cancer (CRC) based on COX-2/C-MET/KRAS expression status in clinical practice.,The regulatory roles of long noncoding RNAs in the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720003,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,2019 06 10,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new class of regulators. LncRNAs are defined as endogenous transcribed RNA molecules with transcript length of >200 nt. Accumulating evidence has shown that lncRNAs are involved in many physiological processes such as cell cycle regulation, cell apoptosis and survival, cancer migration and metabolism. However, the biological and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer are still unclear. Recent studies have reported that many lncRNAs are dysregulated in pancreatic cancer and closely associated with tumorigenesis, diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we described the regulation and functional role of lncRNAs and the potential underlying mechanism involved in pancreatic cancer, outlined the roles of lncRNA in pancreatic cancer, and discussed the potential possibility of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets in clinical practice. Moreover, the potential of lncRNAs used as sensitive biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to therapy in pancreatic cancer will also be discussed.",Greater prevalence of comorbidities with increasing age: Cross-sectional analysis of chronic hepatitis B patients in Saudi Arabia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720002,Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,2019 06 10,"Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia to some extent, are endemic for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection which could be associated with high mortality and comorbidities risk.

In this review, we aim to assess the current situation of the HBV care pathway in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), identify gaps/barriers therein, and recommend initiatives to be taken to improve the management of such patients. Towards this end, a literature search was conducted in PubMed and free Internet searches. Interviews with individuals and focus group discussions were held with HBV experts in KSA. Although significant improvements have been made in the past 30 years in KSA in terms of the decline in prevalence (currently estimated to be around 1.3%), the morbidity and mortality related to the disease have not shown a parallel decline. This makes HBV an important public health concern. Furthermore, poor disease awareness, low diagnosis rates, and nonadherence to therapy amplify the disease burden. There are several mandated national screening structures present; however, established protocols for those who test positive and subsequent linkage-to-care are inadequate. In the absence of a virologic cure, a concerted effort should be made to provide safe and effective lifelong treatment.

However, neurons that regulate the sleep homeostat remain poorly understood. Using neurogenetic approaches combined with Ca2+ imaging, we characterized synaptic connections between dFB neurons and distinct sets of upstream sleep-regulatory neurons. One group of the sleep-promoting upstream neurons is a set of circadian pacemaker neurons that activates dFB neurons via direct glutaminergic excitatory synaptic connections. Opposing this population, a group of arousal-promoting neurons downregulates dFB axonal output with dopamine. Co-activating these two inputs leads to frequent shifts between sleep and wake states. We also show that dFB neurons release the neurotransmitter GABA and inhibit octopaminergic arousal neurons. We propose that dFB neurons integrate synaptic inputs from distinct sets of upstream sleep-promoting circadian clock neurons, and arousal neurons.",Time preferences are reliable across time-horizons and verbal versus experiential tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719974,eLife,2019 02 07,"Individual differences in delay-discounting correlate with important real world outcomes, for example education, income, drug use, and criminality. As such, delay-discounting has been extensively studied by economists, psychologists and neuroscientists to reveal its behavioral and biological mechanisms in both human and non-human animal models. However, two major methodological differences hinder comparing results across species. Human studies present long time-horizon options verbally, whereas animal studies employ experiential cues and short delays. To bridge these divides, we developed a novel language-free experiential task inspired by animal decision-making studies. We found that the ranks of subjects' time-preferences were reliable across both verbal/experiential and second/day differences. Yet, discount factors scaled dramatically across the tasks, indicating a strong effect of temporal context. Taken together, this indicates that individuals have a stable, but context-dependent, time-preference that can be reliably assessed using different methods, providing a foundation to bridge studies of time-preferences across species.","Unsupervised discovery of temporal sequences in high-dimensional datasets, with applications to neuroscience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719973,eLife,2019 02 12,"Identifying low-dimensional features that describe large-scale neural recordings is a major challenge in neuroscience. Repeated temporal patterns (sequences) are thought to be a salient feature of neural dynamics, but are not succinctly captured by traditional dimensionality reduction techniques. Here, we describe a software toolbox-called seqNMF-with new methods for extracting informative, non-redundant, sequences from high-dimensional neural data, testing the significance of these extracted patterns, and assessing the prevalence of sequential structure in data. We test these methods on simulated data under multiple noise conditions, and on several real neural and behavioral datas. In hippocampal data, seqNMF identifies neural sequences that match those calculated manually by reference to behavioral events. In songbird data, seqNMF discovers neural sequences in untutored birds that lack stereotyped songs. Thus, by identifying temporal structure directly from neural data, seqNMF enables dissection of complex neural circuits without relying on temporal references from stimuli or behavioral outputs.",Listeria monocytogenes cell-to-cell spread in epithelia is heterogeneous and dominated by rare pioneer bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719971,eLife,2019 06 10,"Listeria monocytogenes hijacks host actin to promote its intracellular motility and intercellular spread.

We show that boundaries of infection foci are irregular and dominated by rare pioneer bacteria that spread farther than the rest. We extend our quantitative model for bacterial spread to show that heterogeneous spreading behavior can improve the chances of creating a persistent L. monocytogenes infection in an actively extruding epithelium. Thus, our results indicate that L. monocytogenes cell-to-cell spread is heterogeneous, and that rare pioneer bacteria determine the frontier of infection foci and may promote bacterial infection persistence in dynamic epithelia.",Increased expression levels of FcγRIIB on naïve and double-negative memory B cells in patients with systemic sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719970,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,2019 02 05,"In systemic sclerosis (SSc), B cell hyperactivation and abnormality are considered to play an important role in the disease pathophysiology.

We conducted 12 focus groups with communities in three health zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and held 32 interviews with health-care providers, managers, policy makers, and public health experts. The topic guide focused on enabling and blocking factors related to the integrated diagnosis and treatment approach. The data were analyzed with NVivo (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) using a thematic analysis process. The results showed that the community mostly welcomed integrated care for diagnosis and treatment of sleeping sickness, as they value the proximity of first-line health services, but feared possible financial barriers. Health-care professionals thought integration contributed to the elimination goal but identified several implementation challenges, such as the lack of skills, equipment, motivation and financial resources in these basic health services. Patients often use multiple therapeutic itineraries that do not necessarily lead them to health centers where screening is available. Financial barriers are important, as health care is not free in first-line health centers, in contrast to the population screening campaigns. Communities and providers signal several challenges regarding the integration process. To succeed, the required training of health professionals, as well as staff deployment and remuneration policy and the financial barriers in the primary care system need to be addressed, to ensure coverage for those most in need."

We assess the association of diverticulosis with nine selected CTDs, to inform the pathophysiology of diverticula. Methods: A population-based period-prevalence study. Individuals (3.5 million New Zealand residents born 1901-1986) with a health system record 1999-2016 were grouped into those with a hospital diagnosis of diverticulosis or diverticulitis (ICD-10-AM K57), and those without. Also recorded were any hospital diagnoses of nine selected CTDs. The association of exposure to diverticulosis and each CTD was assessed using logistic regressions adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and region. Results: In all, 85,958 (2.4%) people had a hospital diagnosis of diverticulosis. Hospitalisation with diverticulosis was highly significantly associated with rectal prolapse (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.9), polycystic kidney disease (OR = 3.8), heritable syndromes (Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos) (OR = 2.4), female genital prolapse (OR = 2.3), non-aortic aneurysm (OR = 2.3), aortic aneurysm (OR = 2.2), inguinal hernia (OR = 1.9) and dislocations of shoulder and other joints (OR = 1.7), but not subarachnoid haemorrhage (OR = 1.0). Conclusion: People with diverticulosis are more likely to have colonic extracellular matrix (ECM)/connective tissue alterations in anatomical areas other than the bowel, suggesting linked ECM/connective tissue pathology. Although biases may exist, the results indicate large-scale integrated studies are needed to investigate underlying genetic pathophysiology of colonic diverticula, together with fundamental biological studies to investigate cellular phenotypes and ECM changes.",A discussion of statistical methods to characterise early growth and its impact on bone mineral content later in childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719940,Annals of human biology,2019 06 10,Many statistical methods are available to model longitudinal growth data and relate derived summary measures to later outcomes.,Tensions and Contradictions in Interns' Communication about Unexpected Pregnancy Loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719939,Health communication,2019 02 05,"Early miscarriage is an unexpected pregnancy complication that affects up to 25% of pregnant women.

We observed and analyzed transcripts from 40 standardized patient encounters using Baxter's relational dialectics theory 2.0. Results indicated that interns invoked two primary distal already-spoken discourses: discourses of medicalization of miscarriage and discourses of rationality and informed consent. We contend that tensions and contradictions could affect how women respond to the news of an impending miscarriage and offer practical implications for communication skills training.","When a Personal HPV Story on a Blog Influences Perceived Social Norms: The Roles of Personal Experience, Framing, Perceived Similarity, and Social Media Metrics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719938,Health communication,2019 02 05,"The current study examines how a personal health story on a blog can influence individuals' perceived social norms, adopting the notion that social norms are ""group identity-based codes of conduct"".

In an online experiment, college students (N = 220) were recruited to read a blogger's story in either a gain-frame (the blogger received the HPV vaccine and, thus, prevented cancer) or a loss-frame (the blogger did not receive the vaccine and, thus, developed cancer) with either high or low social media metrics. Participants reported that they were more similar with the blogger in the gain-framed story than the one in the loss-framed story, especially among those who have received the HPV. This perceived similarity was positively associated with both descriptive and injunctive norms; however, the positive association between similarity and descriptive norms disappeared when the blog had low social media metrics.

Cognitively healthy older individuals (n = 198) enrolled in a study of cardiovascular health completed the Stroop as part of a neuropsychological battery. Two scores were computed for the Color-Word trial: the number of items completed within the first 45 seconds (traditional Color-Word score) and the speed of page completion beyond the first 45 seconds (Stroop-Extended score). Criterion measures included the Trail-Making Test Part B (TMT-B), Digit Span Backward, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Short Category Test, and measures of verbal fluency. Results from hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that the extended Stroop score accounted for small but statistically significant variance in TMT-B (additional 2.6%) and Digit Span Backwards (additional 2.6%) beyond the standard Color-Word score. These findings suggest that extending the Stroop Color-Word trial beyond the first 45 seconds provides a limited increase in predictive power within a healthy sample with restricted range of performance. The extended Stroop requires additional examination in heterogeneous samples, including clinical populations, to determine its predictive utility.","Direct and crossover effects of brinzolamide, betaxolol, and latanoprost on choroidal thickness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719935,Cutaneous and ocular toxicology,2019 04 08,"To investigate the acute effects of brinzolamide, betaxolol, and latanoprost (drugs commonly used in the medical management of glaucoma) on choroidal thickness using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT)."

To address this issue, bifunctional biomaterials equipped with effective tumor therapeutic capacity for skin cancers and simultaneous tissue regenerative ability for wound closure are highly recommended. Herein, we report an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (named BT-CTS thermogel) with the integration of nanosized black titania (B-TiO2- x, ∼50 nm) nanoparticles into a chitosan (CTS) matrix. The B-TiO2- x nanocrystal exhibits a crystalline/amorphous core-shell structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, which endows the BT-CTS thermogels with simultaneous photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) effects under single-wavelength near-infrared laser irradiation, leading to an excellent therapeutic effect on skin tumors in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the BT-CTS thermogel not only supports the adhesion, proliferation, and migration of normal skin cells but also facilitates skin tissue regeneration in a murine chronic wound model. Therefore, such BT-CTS thermogels with easy injectability, excellent thermostability, and simultaneous PTT and PDT efficacy as well as tissue regenerative activity offers a promising pathway for the healing of cutaneous tumor-induced wounds.","Propolis Components from Stingless Bees Collected on South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and Their Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitory Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719922,Journal of natural products,2019 02 22,"Three new compounds, namely, 4-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxycoumarin (1) and sulawesins A (2) and B (3), were isolated from the propolis of stingless bees ( Tetragonula aff. biroi) collected on South Sulawesi, Indonesia.

The drying interface constitutes the region of initial drying stress that, when accumulated over a critical thickness, leads to crack formation. This work presents an experimental study of top-down drying of colloidal silica dispersions with three different sizes (radius 5, 8, and 13 nm). Using specular neutron reflectivity, we focus on the structural evolution at the free drying front of the dispersion with a macroscopic drying surface and demonstrate the existence of a thick concentrated surface layer induced by heterogeneous evaporation. The reflectivity profile contains a strong structure peak due to scattering from particles in the interfacial region, from which the interparticle distance is deduced. A notable advantage of these measurements is the direct extraction of the corresponding dispersion concentration from the critical total reflection edge, providing a straightforward access to a structure-concentration relation during the drying process. The bulk reservoir of this experimental configuration renders it possible to verify the evaporation-diffusion balance to construct the surface layer and also to check reversibility of particle ordering. We follow the structural evolution of this surface layer from a sol to a soft wet-gel that is the precursor of a fragile skin and the onset of significant particle aggregation that precedes formation of the wet-crust. Separate complementary measurements on the structural evolution in the bulk dispersion are also carried out by small-angle neutron scattering, where the particle concentration is also extracted directly from the experimental curves. The two sets of data reveal similar structural evolution with concentration at the interface and in the bulk and an increase in the degree of ordering with the particle size.",Carbonic Acid Eluent Ion Chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719920,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 05,"Alkali metals, amines and alkanolamines are separated on a poly(butadiene)-maleic acid on silica stationary phase using a carbonic acid (H2CO3*) eluent with and without a mineral acid. The H2CO3* eluent is prepared in situ by high pressure permeative introduction of gaseous CO2 through thin membranes supported upon a porous steel disk. The permeation flux and thus the eluent concentration is controlled by varying the applied CO2 pressure. This novel frit-supported membrane device tolerates much higher liquid and gas pressures than Teflon AF capillaries, permitting [H2CO3*] exceeding 0.53 M and attaining a pH of 3.3. Silicone was presently preferred over Teflon AF, both as planar membranes, as mechanical properties of the latter change as large amounts of CO2 dissolve in it. After separation, the CO2 can be efficiently removed via another gas permeable membrane device permitting detection of the eluting bicarbonate salt conductometrically in a background of nearly pure water. Most analytes are more sensitively detected after anion conversion to hydroxide using a standard suppressor, permitting 3-17 pmol LODs on 2 mm bore columns. The data, particularly comparisons with an HNO3 eluent, with or without H2CO3*, indicate that proton exchange alone does not account for the retention behavior; some reactive addition of HCO3- is involved.","Tunable, Multifunctional Ceramic Composites via Intercalation of Fused Graphene Boron Nitride Nanosheets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719919,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Ternary two-dimensional (2D) materials such as fused graphene-boron nitride (GBN) nanosheets exhibit attractive physical and tunable properties far beyond their parent structures. Although these features impart several multifunctional properties in various matrices, a fundamental understanding on the nature of the interfacial interactions of these ternary 2D materials with host matrices and the role of their individual components has been elusive. Herein, we focus on intercalated GBN/ceramic composites as a model system and perform a series of density functional theory calculations to fill this knowledge gap. Propelled by more polarity and negative Gibbs free energy, our results demonstrate that GBN is more water-soluble than graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), making it a preferred choice for slurry preparation and resultant intercalations. Further, a chief attribute of the intercalated GBN/ceramic is the formation of covalent C-O and B-O bonds between the two structures, changing the hybridization of GBN from sp2 to sp3. This change, combined with the electron release in the vicinity of the interfacial regions, leads to several nonintuitive mechanical and electrical alterations of the composite such as exhibiting higher young's modulus, strength, and ductility as well as sharp decline in the band gap. As a limiting case, though both tobermorite ceramic and h-BN are wide band gap materials, their intercalated composite becomes a p-type semiconductor, contrary to intuition. These multifunctional features, along with our fundamental electronic descriptions of the origin of property change, provide key guidelines for synthesizing next generation of multifunctional bilayer ceramics with remarkable properties on demand.",Dynamically Reversible Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Assemblies for Targeted Amplification of T1-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719918,Nano letters,2019 06 12,"Smart magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents, by which MR contrast can be selectively enhanced under acidic tumor microenvironment, are anticipated to significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy. Here, we report pH-sensitive iron oxide nanoparticle assemblies (IONAs) that are cross-linked by small-molecular aldehyde derivative ligands. The dynamic formation and cleavage of hydrazone linkages in neutral and acidic environments, respectively, allow the reversible response of the nanoassemblies to pH variations. At neutral pH, IONAs are structurally robust due to the cross-linking by the strong hydrazone bonds. In acidic tumor microenvironment, the hydrazone bonds are cleaved so that the IONAs are quickly disassembled into a large number of hydrophilic extremely small-sized iron oxide nanoparticles (ESIONs). As a result, significantly enhanced T1MR contrast is achieved, as confirmed by the measurement of r1 values at different pH conditions. Such acidity-targeting MR signal amplification by the pH-sensitive IONAs was further validated in vivo, demonstrating a novel T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategy for highly sensitive imaging of acidic tumors.",Mobility-Based Quantification of Multivalent Virus-Receptor Interactions: New Insights Into Influenza A Virus Binding Mode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719917,Nano letters,2019 03 16,"Viruses, such as influenza A, typically bind to the plasma membrane of their host by engaging multiple membrane receptors in parallel, thereby forming so-called multivalent interactions that are created by the collective action of multiple weak ligand-receptor bonds. The overall interaction strength can be modulated by changing the number of engaged receptors. This feature is used by viruses to achieve a sufficiently firm attachment to the host's plasma membrane but also allows progeny viruses to leave the plasma membrane after completing the virus replication cycle. Design of strategies to prevent infection, for example, by disturbing these attachment and detachment processes upon application of antivirals, requires quantification of the underlying multivalent interaction in absence and presence of antivirals. This is still an unresolved problem, as there is currently no approach available that allows for determining the valency (i.e., of the number of receptors bound to a particular virus) on the level of single viruses under equilibrium conditions. Herein, we track the motion of single influenza A/X31 viruses (IAVs; interacting with the ganglioside GD1a incorporated in a supported lipid bilayer) using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and show that IAV residence time distributions can be deconvoluted from valency effects by taking the IAV mobility into account. The so-derived off-rate distributions, expressed in dependence of an average, apparent valency, show the expected decrease in off-rate with increasing valency but also show an unexpected peak structure, which can be linked to a competition in the opposing functionalities of the two influenza A virus spike proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). By application of the antiviral zanamivir that inhibits the activity of NA, we provide direct evidence, how the HA/NA balance modulates this virus-receptor interaction, allowing us to assess the inhibition concentration of zanamivir based on its effect on the multivalent interaction.",Dihedral Angle Calculations To Elucidate the Folding of Peptides through Its Main Mechanical Forces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719916,Biochemistry,2019 02 26,"This study reports a general method to calculate dihedral angles (φ and ψ) of a given amino acid sequence, focusing on potential energy and torque moment concepts. By defining these physical measures in relation to the chemical interactions that occur on each single amino acid residue within a peptide, we analyze the folding process as the result of main mechanical forces (MMFs) exerted in the specific amino acid chain of interest. As a proof of concept, Leu-enkephalin was initially used as a model peptide to carry out the theoretical study. Our data show agreement between calculated Leu-enkephalin backbone dihedral angles and the corresponding experimentally determined X-ray values. Hence, we used calcitonin to validate our MMF-based method on a larger peptide, i.e., 32 amino acid residues forming an α-helix. Through a similar approach (although simplified with regard to electrostatic interactions), the calculations for calcitonin also demonstrate a good agreement with experimental values. This study offers new opportunities to analyze peptides' amino acid sequences and to help in the prediction of how they must fold, assisting in the development of new computational techniques in the field.",Xylomolones A-D from the Thai Mangrove Xylocarpus moluccensis: Assignment of Absolute Stereostructures and Unveiling a Convergent Strategy for Limonoid Biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719915,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 03 01,"Two new 9,10- seco limonoids with a central 3,4-dihydro-2 H-pyran motif, named xylomolones A and B (1 and 2, respectively), possessing identical absolute configurations but reversed alignments of ring A, compared to the tricyclic core of rings B-D, were obtained from seeds of the Thai mangrove Xylocarpus moluccensis, together with a highly modified 1,2- seco limonoid, named xylomolone C (3), containing a novel 3-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2,7-dione motif, and a new C11-terpenic acid methyl ester (4).

Because persulfide and polysulfide species are highly reducing, we speculate that 9,10-PQ might undergo one-electron reduction with these reactive sulfides. In the present study, we explored the redox cycling capability of a variety of quinone-related electron acceptors, including 9,10-PQ, during interactions with the hydropersulfide Na2S2 and its related polysulfides. No reaction occurred when 9,10-PQ was incubated with Na2S; however, when 5 μM 9,10-PQ was incubated with either 250 μM Na2S2 or Na2S4, we detected extensive consumption of dissolved oxygen (84 μM). Under these conditions, both the semiquinone radicals of 9,10-PQ and their thiyl radical species were also detected using ESR, suggesting that a redox cycle reaction occurred utilizing one-electron reduction processes. Notably, the perthiyl radicals remained stable even under aerobic conditions. Similar phenomenon has also been observed with other electron acceptors, such as pyrroloquinoline quinone, vitamin K3, and coenzyme Q10. Our experiments with N-methoxycarbonyl penicillamine persulfide (MCPSSH), a precursor for endogenous cysteine persulfide, suggested the possibility of a redox coupling reaction with 9,10-PQ inside cells. Our study indicates that hydropersulfide and its related polysulfides are efficient electron donors that interact with quinones. Redox coupling reactions between quinoid electron acceptors and such highly reactive thiols might occur in biological systems."

In recent years it has been recognised that person-centred care can lead to better outcomes for patients and a reduced burden on healthcare systems. The aim of this study was to explore what really matters to members of the public when they visit a GP in Ireland.
Methods
This qualitative study used a structured interview methodology with one question; “What really matters to you when you go to see a GP?” Results were analysed using an integrated approach, involving both inductive and deductive methods.
Results
Responses from the 10 study participants were subdivided into two overarching themes: the General Practitioner as a person and the General Practice as a service. Personality (open, approachable, personable, trusted, interested) and service (time, cost, convenience, personal relationship) traits matter to patients.
Conclusion
Patients must be facilitated and encouraged to voice what really matters to them in order to inform truly person-centred healthcare improvement.",A Profile of Psychiatric In-Patient Admissions With No Fixed Abode (NFA) 2007-2016,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719894,Irish medical journal,2019 02 05,"Aims
This paper examines admissions for the last ten years for those recorded as of no fixed abode (NFA) on the National Psychiatric In-Patient Reporting System (NPIRS).
Methods
The Health Research Board’s (HRB) NPIRS data were analysed using SPSS to develop an overview of admissions with NFA recorded for the years 2007-2016 (n=2,176). 
Results
In the period 2007-2016 there were 2,176 admissions with NFA recorded. In that 10-year period there was a 44% increase in admissions with NFA from 188 in 2007 to 271 in 2016.  The analysis shows that the characteristics of this cohort have remained largely unchanged in the 10 years; almost three-quarters (1,598; 73.4%) were male, almost half (1,068; 49.1%) were less than 35 years of age and three-quarters (1,638; 75.2%) were less than 45 years.  Three-quarters (1,643; 75.5%) were single and a similar proportion was unemployed (1,640; 75.4%).  In addition, the highest proportion had a diagnosis of schizophrenia (621; 28.5%) followed by drugs/alcohol disorders (590; 27.1%). These characteristics are consistent with the single ‘chronically homeless’ people described in the literature.
Discussion
The paper concludes the need to use routinely collected data to help understand and address the need of specific homeless sub-groups particularly those on institutional circuits that include psychiatric in-patient facilities.  To enable this it recommends the implementation of the individual health identifier as a matter of urgency.",Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries: A Survey of Clinical Practice and Education among Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Ireland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719893,Irish medical journal,2019 02 05,"This paper summarises results of a survey of obstetricians in Ireland regarding their technique, management, and education on episiotomy and Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injury (OASIS).

The balance between effectiveness and side effects may be totally different from what is expected. Physiological and pathophysiological changes can cause the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medicines to change. Drug-drug interactions can enhance or decrease the effects of medicines. In frail older people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy in particular, these changes may lead to a higher risk of side effects and a decline in the analgesic effect. The vulnerability of many older people means that even when pain is adequately controlled, concomitant side effects of medicines can have a big negative impact on their general functioning. Pharmacological pain management in older people requires specific competences and knowledge.

The appearance of an asymmetrical scrotum, which is associated with UDT, may negatively influence quality of life. Over 50% of the acquired UDTs will spontaneously descend at the start of puberty, thereby justifying conservative management of the condition.

Viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, were much more frequent than bacterial pathogens. The authors conclude that their new findings support a restrictive approach to antibiotic prescribing. Better diagnostics for aetiology are advocated for use in primary care. This article discusses the impact of these new data on the already broadly shared views on antibiotic stewardship, including restrictive use of antibiotics in non-severe infections. The question is raised whether the possible benefits of broad implementation of specific, diagnostic tests for aetiology outweigh the possible harm in primary care.

Recently, various devices and smart phone applications that measure blood pressure without a cuff using pulse transit time (PTT) have become available. These measurements are based on the inverse relationship between blood pressure and PTT. PTT constitutes the time delay between the QRS complex on ECG and the onset of a photoplethysmography pulse wave, for example in the finger. Since these measurements are relatively more user-friendly than conventional cuff-based measurements, they may aid in more frequent blood pressure monitoring by patients themselves. Initial validation studies, however, seem to suggest that blood pressure measurement using PTT is not accurate. Given the current pace of development in PTT-based blood pressure monitors it seems likely that physicians will be increasingly confronted with measurements from these devices. For the time being, it seems wise to not recommend these types of monitors to patients and to avoid using any of their measurements when making diagnostic or therapeutic decisions."

They are tolerant to functional group substitution and heteroatom inclusion, so can be used to form a diverse range of extended polyaromatic systems by fusing existing ring substituents. However, despite their undoubted synthetic utility, there are no existing models-computational or heuristic-that predict the outcome of photocyclisation reactions across all possible classes of reactants. This can be traced back to the fact that ""negative"" results are rarely published in the synthetic literature and the lack of a general conceptual framework for understanding how photoexcitation affects reactivity. In this work, we address both of these issues. We present experimental data for a series of aromatically substituted pyrroles and indoles, and show that quantifying induced atomic forces upon photoexcitation provides a powerful predictive model for determining whether a given reactant will photoplanarise and hence proceed to photocyclised product under appropriate reaction conditions. The propensity of a molecule to photoplanarise is related to localised changes in charge distribution around the putative forming ring upon photoexcitation. This is promoted by asymmetry in molecular structures and/or charge distributions, inclusion of heteroatoms and ethylene bridging and well-separated or isolated photocyclisation sites.",Encapsulation of an Ionic Metalloporphyrin into a Zeolite Imidazolate Framework in situ for CO2 Chemical Transformation via Host-Guest Synergistic Catalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719869,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 04 03,"It is a great challenge to rationally integrate multiple reactive sites into a composite material with confined nanospace, which can be applied as a nanoreactor to facilitate targeting catalytic reaction.

However, available QPI modalities are limited by the loss of imaging resolution at high throughput and thus run short of sufficient statistical power at the single-cell precision to define cell identities in a large and heterogeneous population of cells-hindering their utility in mainstream biomedicine and biology. Here we present a new QPI modality, coined multiplexed asymmetric-detection time-stretch optical microscopy (multi-ATOM) that captures and processes quantitative label-free single-cell images at ultrahigh throughput without compromising subcellular resolution. We show that multi-ATOM, based upon ultrafast phase-gradient encoding, outperforms state-of-the-art QPI in permitting robust phase retrieval at a QPI throughput of >10 000 cell/sec, bypassing the need for interferometry which inevitably compromises QPI quality under ultrafast operation. We employ multi-ATOM for large-scale, label-free, multivariate, cell-type classification (e.g. breast cancer subtypes, and leukemic cells vs peripheral blood mononuclear cells) at high accuracy (>94%). Our results suggest that multi-ATOM could empower new strategies in large-scale biophysical single-cell analysis with applications in biology and enriching disease diagnostics.",Concise Review: Canine Diabetes Mellitus as a Translational Model for Innovative Regenerative Medicine Approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719867,Stem cells translational medicine,2019 04 28,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common spontaneous endocrine disorder in dogs, which is defined by persistent hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency. Like type 1 diabetes (T1D) in people, canine DM is a complex and multifactorial disease in which genomic and epigenomic factors interact with environmental cues to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and insulin deficiency, although the pathogenesis of canine DM is poorly defined and the role of autoimmunity is further controversial. Both diseases are incurable and require life-long exogenous insulin therapy to maintain glucose homeostasis. Human pancreatic islet physiology, size, and cellular composition is further mirrored by canine islets. Although pancreatic or isolated islets transplantation are the only clinically validated methods to achieve long-term normoglycemia and insulin independence, their availability does not meet the clinical need; they target a small portion of patients and have significant potential adverse effects. Therefore, providing a new source for β-cell replacement is an unmet need. Naturally occurring DM in pet dogs, as a translational platform, is an untapped resource for various regenerative medicine applications that may offer some unique advantages given dogs' large size, longevity, heterogenic genetic background, similarity to human physiology and pathology, and long-term clinical management. In this review, we outline different strategies for curative approaches, animal models used, and consider the value of canine DM as a translational animal/disease model for T1D in people.

Part A,2019 04 10,"Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by distinctive facial features and intellectual disability caused by haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed, with major anomalies seen more frequently in patients with 5q35 deletions than those with point mutations in NSD1. Though endocrine features have rarely been described, transient hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HI) of the neonatal period has been reported as an uncommon presentation of Sotos syndrome. Eight cases of 5q35 deletions and one patient with an intragenic NSD1 mutation with transient HI have been reported. Here, we describe seven individuals with HI caused by NSD1 gene mutations with three having persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. These patients with persistent HI and Sotos syndrome caused by NSD1 mutations, further dispel the hypothesis that HI is due to the deletion of other genes in the deleted 5q35 region. These patients emphasize that NSD1 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause HI, and suggest that Sotos syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with neonatal HI. Lastly, these patients help extend the phenotypic spectrum of Sotos syndrome to include HI as a significant feature.","Cutaneous microangiopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes: Impaired vascular endothelial growth factor expression and its correlation with neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719863,Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 04 02,"To examine the three-dimensional morphology and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression of skin microvasculature in patients with type 2 diabetes in relation to neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy.","A randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of the efficacy and safety of the Occlutech Figulla Flex-II Occluder compared to the Amplatzer Septal Occluder for transcatheter closure of secundum atrial septal defects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719850,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2019 02 05,The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the Occlutech Figulla Flex II Occluder (OFFII) with the Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) in patients > 8kg undergoing transcatheter ASD closure.,Raman exfoliative cytology for prognosis prediction in oral cancers: A proof of concept study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719849,Journal of biophotonics,2019 04 24,"Oral cancer is associated with high rates of recurrence, attributable to field cancerization. Early detection of advanced field changes that can potentially progress to carcinoma can facilitate timely intervention and can lead to improved prognosis. Previous in vivo studies have successfully detected advanced field effects in oral cancers. Raman exfoliative cytology has previously shown to differentiate normal, oral pre-cancer and cancers. The present study explores Raman-exfoliative-cytology-based detection of field effects. Exfoliated cells were collected from tumor (n = 16) and contralateral-normal appearing mucosa (n = 16) of oral cancer patients, and healthy tobacco habitués (n = 20). After spectral acquisition, specimens were Pap-stained for cytological evaluation. Data analysis, by Principal Component Analysis and Principal Component-Linear Discriminant Analysis, indicate several spectral-misclassifications between contralateral normal and tumor, which were investigated and correlated with spectral, cytological and clinical outcomes. A qualitative analysis by grouping patients with number of misclassifications with tumor (Group 1: 0, Group 2: 1 and Group 3: >1) was explored. Group 3 with highest misclassifications showed spectral and cytological similarity to tumor group - one patient was a case of early inoperable residual disease, despite clear margins on histopathology. Thus, these misclassifications could be indicative of cancer field changes, and can prospectively help to identify patients susceptible to recurrences ."

The volatile constituents were analyzed using GC/MS, the antioxidant activity was evaluated by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORACFL ) and DPPH assays, and the antimicrobial activity by a microdilution technique. Of the 56 compounds identified, only seven (β-caryophyllene, γ-muurolene, bicyclogermacrene, β-germacrene, spathulenol, τ-muurolol, and α-cadinol) were common in the three specimens studied.

However, its responsiveness is still very limited and WT KRAS is not enough to indicate such responsiveness. Here, by analyzing the gene expression data of CRC patients treated with CTX monotherapy, we have identified DUSP4, ETV5, GNB5, NT5E, and PHLDA1 as potential targets to overcome CTX resistance. We found that knockdown of any of these five genes can increase CTX sensitivity in KRAS WT cells. Interestingly, we further found that GNB5 knockdown can increase CTX sensitivity even for KRAS mutant cells. We unraveled that GNB5 overexpression contributes to CTX resistance by modulating the Akt signaling pathway from experiments and mathematical simulation. Overall, these results indicate that GNB5 might be a promising target for combination therapy with CTX irrespective of KRAS mutation.",Early post-operative intravenous tacrolimus in pediatric liver transplant recipients is not superior to oral tacrolimus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719833,Pediatric transplantation,2019 02 05,"We aimed to compare the early results of i.v. with p.o.

This retrospective study enrolled 75 children who underwent LT and received TAC-steroid regimens as a primary immunosuppressant between September 2011 and October 2015 at our institution. Thirty-five recipients received TAC i.v. and 40 received TAC p.o. Early results were evaluated and compared, including ACR, EBV, or CMV infection; renal adverse effects; and hospital stay. Comparisons of 90-day post-transplant results showed that the rates of overall viral (74% vs 40% P < 0.002), EBV (46% vs 17.5% P < 0.008), and CMV (51% vs 30% P = 0.05) infections were significantly higher in the i.v. than in the p.o. group. Neither regimen has any adverse effects on renal function. There were no between-group differences in ACR incidence and severity, serum creatinine concentration, and hospital stay. Patient and graft survival rates at 3 months and 1 year did not differ significantly between the two groups. Compared with p.o. treatment, i.v. administration of high TAC concentration did not have beneficial post-transplant effects on ACR incidence and severity, while increasing the incidence of viral infections in pediatric LT.",A subset of calcium-binding S100 proteins show preferential heterodimerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719832,The FEBS journal,2019 05 20,"The assembly of proteins into dimers and oligomers is a necessary step for the proper function of transcription factors, muscle proteins, and proteases. In uncontrolled states, oligomerization can also contribute to illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. The S100 protein family is a group of dimeric proteins that have important roles in enzyme regulation, cell membrane repair, and cell growth. Most S100 proteins have been examined in their homodimeric state, yet some of these important proteins are found in similar tissues implying that heterodimeric molecules can also be formed from the combination of two different S100 members. In this work, we have established co-expression methods in order to identify and quantify the distribution of homo- and heterodimers for four specific pairs of S100 proteins in their calcium-free states. The split GFP trap methodology was used in combination with other GFP variants to simultaneously quantify homo- and heterodimeric S100 proteins in vitro and in living cells. For the specific S100 proteins examined, NMR, mass spectrometry, and GFP trap experiments consistently show that S100A1:S100B, S100A1:S100P, and S100A11:S100B heterodimers are the predominant species formed compared to their corresponding homodimers. We expect the tools developed here will help establish the roles of S100 heterodimeric proteins and identify how heterodimerization might alter the specificity for S100 protein action in cells.",Influence of poly-l-lysine molecular weight on antibacterial efficacy in polymer multilayer films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719831,Journal of biomedical materials research. Part A,2019 05 03,"Antibacterial coatings can prevent and treat medical device-associated infections. We examined the antibacterial properties of coatings assembled from poly-l-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (HA). PLL/HA films were fabricated using layer-by-layer assembly with three different PLL MWs, differentiated by number of repeat units, that is, 33, 91, and 407 (denoted by PLL30 , PLL90 , and PLL400 ). Films assembled with all three PLL MWs completely inhibited the growth of planktonic, gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli over a 24-h exposure. All three film architectures also inhibited S. aureus attachment by ~60-70% compared to non-film-coated surfaces, likely attributed to significant film hydration and electrostatic repulsion due to HA. The true differences in antibacterial efficacy between different PLL MWs were observed upon repeated exposure of PLL/HA to S. aureus every 24 h. We found that PLL400 films lost the ability to inhibit planktonic S. aureus growth after one use while PLL30 and PLL90 films were effective over 4-5 and 9-13 repeated exposures, respectively. Our experiments indicated that differences in efficacy were related to low in-film mobility of PLL400 and also agreed with dissolution timescales for PLL30 and PLL90 films. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Factors that are associated with this decrease have not been well characterized. Low plasma lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), a major class of systemic bioactive lipids, are predictive of aging phenotypes such as cognitive impairment and decline of gait speed in older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that low plasma LPC are associated with impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity was measured using in vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P-MRS) in 385 participants (256 women, 129 men), aged 24-97 years (mean 72.5) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Postexercise recovery rate of phosphocreatine (PCr), kPCr , was used as a biomarker of mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Plasma LPC were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Adults in the highest quartile of kPCr had higher plasma LPC 16:0 (p = 0.04), 16:1 (p = 0.004), 17:0 (p = 0.01), 18:1 (p = 0.0002), 18:2 (p = 0.002), and 20:3 (p = 0.0007), but not 18:0 (p = 0.07), 20:4 (p = 0.09) compared with those in the lower three quartiles in multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, and height. Multiple machine-learning algorithms showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.638 (95% confidence interval, 0.554, 0.723) comparing six LPC in adults in the lower three quartiles of kPCr with the highest quartile.

NPs display significant antioxidant (32.7% free radical scavenging activity) and antileishmanial (IC50 48 µg mL-1 ) properties. In vitro toxicity tested against lymphocytes verified that NPs are biocompatible (99.38% viability of lymphocytes at 2.5 μg mL-1 ). In vivo toxicity experiments showed no harmful effects on rat serum chemistry and histology of various organs and did not even change the concentration of antioxidative enzymes, total protein contents, lipid peroxidation, and nitrosative stress.

TAC is the more common, traditional immunosuppressant used. However, SRL may modulate TAC-associated kidney injury and may also have antiproliferative properties that are valuable in the management of patients following liver transplantation for HB. We sought to determine whether early conversion from TAC to SRL was safe, effective, and beneficial in a subset of liver transplant recipients with unresectable HB exposed to CDDP-based chemotherapy. Between 2008 and 2013, six patients were transplanted for unresectable HB. All patients received at least one cycle of CDDP-based chemotherapy prior to transplant. All patients were switched from TAC- to SRL-based immunosuppression within 1 year of transplant. Five patients had improvement in their mGFR, while one patient had a slight decline. The improvement in mGFR was statistically significant. No adverse events were identified. Three patients had BPAR that responded to pulsed steroids. Historical controls showed similar rates of BPAR within the first year after transplant. There were no identified HB recurrences in the follow-up time period. Conversion from TAC to SRL appears to be safe and effective in this selected group of pediatric liver transplant recipients without adverse reaction or HB recurrences."

Proinflammatory cytokines have become a point of interest in the interconnecting areas of neuropsychiatric and autoimmune diseases. The cytokine hypothesis of depression suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a primary role in the mediation of the pathophysiological characteristics of major depression, in which an inflammatory process may be induced by external and internal stressors, such as psychological and inflammatory diseases, respectively. The higher prevalence of depression, particularly in patients with chronic autoimmune connective tissue disorders (CTD), suggests that depression may present a dysfunctional adaptation of cytokine-induced sickness, which could manifest in times of an exacerbated activation of the innate immune system. Inflammation is thought to contribute to the development of clinical depression through its ability to induce sickness behaviors corresponding to the neurovegetative features of depression, through the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, alterations in neurotransmitter synthesis and reuptake, and through its involvement in the neuroprogression pathways. This review explores the complex interrelationships in which inflammatory responses alter neuroendocrine and neuropsychological regulation contributing to depressive symptoms in CTD. The prevalence and characteristics of depression, and its correlation to the levels of inflammatory cytokines and disease activity among different CTD will be reviewed.",Emerging Palladium and Nickel Catalysts for Copolymerization of Olefins with Polar Monomers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719812,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 20,"Transition-metal-catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers represents a challenge because of the large variety of substrate-induced side reactions.

This might be due to the resulting fusion protein having N-terminal truncated p63 with high oncogenic ability. Since this N-terminal domain has the function of tumor suppressor activity, the mechanism for high oncogenic capacity is thought to be the dominant negative function. Here, we report two ALCL cases with TP63 rearrangement that was each given too short a prognosis (Case 1 and 2: four and six months) in spite of intensive treatment. Immunohistochemically, p63 was highly expressed, and a sprit signal was detected using a TP63 break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in each case. Additionally, a poor prognostic marker of ALCL, all cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1, Granzyme B, and Perforin) were also expressed in almost all ALCL cells. Taken together, we suggest that not only the dominant negative function of N-truncated p63 but also the effect of cytotoxic molecules may influence the dismal prognosis of ALCL with TP63 rearrangement.",Phosphine-Stabilized Diiododiborenes: Isolable Diborenes with Six Labile Bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719809,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 15,"The lability of B=B, B-P, and B-halide bonds is combined in the syntheses of the first diiododiborenes.

Unfortunately, the structural isomers of metal nanoparticles are rare and genuine structural isomerism with distinctly different kernel atom packing (e.g., face-centered cubic (fcc) vs. non-fcc) has not been reported until now. Herein we introduce a novel ion-induction method to synthesize a unique gold nanocluster with a twist mirror symmetry structure. The as-synthesized nanocluster has the same composition but different kernel atom packing to an existing gold nanocluster Au42 (TBBT)26 (TBBT=4-tert-butylbenzenethiolate). The fcc-structured Au42 (TBBT)26 nanocluster shows more enhanced photoluminescence than the non-fcc-structured Au42 (TBBT)26 nanocluster, indicating that the fcc-structure is more beneficial for emission than the non-fcc structure. This idea was supported by comparison of the emission intensity of another three pairs of gold nanoclusters with similar compositions and sizes but with different kernel atom packings (fcc vs. non-fcc).",Exploring Ternary and Quaternary Mixtures in the LiBH4 -NaBH4 -KBH4 -Mg(BH4 )2 -Ca(BH4 )2 System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719807,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 06 13,"Binary combinations of borohydrides have been extensivly investigated evidencing the formation of eutectics, bimetallic compounds or solid solutions.

Possible interactions among borohydrides in equimolar composition has been explored by mechanochemical treatment. The obtained phases were analysed by X-ray diffraction and the thermal behaviour of the mixtures were analysed by HP-DSC and DTA, defining temperature of transitions and decomposition reactions. The release of hydrogen was detected by MS, showing the role of the presence of solid solutions and multi-cation compounds on the hydrogen desorption reactions.

In cattle, thousands of embryos are produced annually. However, since the introduction and widespread use of ART, negative effects on embryos and offspring are starting to emerge. Knowledge so far, mostly provided by animal models, indicates that suboptimal conditions during ART can affect embryo viability and quality, and may induce embryonic stress responses. These stress responses take the form of severe gene expression alterations or modifications in critical epigenetic marks established during early developmental stages that can persist after birth. Unfortunately, while developmental plasticity allows the embryo to survive these stressful conditions, such insult may lead to adult health problems and to long-term effects on offspring that could be transmitted to subsequent generations. In this review, we describe how in mice, livestock, and humans, besides affecting the development of the embryo itself, ART stressors may also have significant repercussions on offspring health and physiology. Finally, we argue the case that better control of stressors during ART will help improve embryo quality and offspring health.",Vacuum-UV and Low-Energy Electron-Induced DNA Strand Breaks - Influence of the DNA Sequence and Substrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719805,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 03 27,"DNA is effectively damaged by radiation, which can on the one hand lead to cancer and is on the other hand directly exploited in the treatment of tumor tissue. DNA strand breaks are already induced by photons having an energy below the ionization energy of DNA. At high photon energies, most of the DNA strand breaks are induced by low-energy secondary electrons. In the present study we quantified photon and electron induced DNA strand breaks in four different 12mer oligonucleotides. They are irradiated directly with 8.44 eV vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons and 8.8 eV low energy electrons (LEE). By using Si instead of VUV transparent CaF2 as a substrate the VUV exposure leads to an additional release of LEEs, which have a maximum energy of 3.6 eV and can significantly enhance strand break cross sections. Atomic force microscopy is used to visualize strand breaks on DNA origami platforms and to determine absolute values for the strand break cross sections. Upon irradiation with 8.44 eV photons all the investigated sequences show very similar strand break cross sections in the range of 1.7-2.3×10-16  cm2 . The strand break cross sections for LEE irradiation at 8.8 eV are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones for VUV photons, and a slight sequence dependence is observed. The sequence dependence is even more pronounced for LEEs with energies <3.6 eV.

In this study, rivaroxaban, a direct factor X inhibitor, attenuates liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ). Male rats were randomly allocated into three groups: a control group, CCl 4 fibrotic group, and CCl 4 +rivaroxaban (5 mg/kg) group. Liver fibrosis was induced by subcutaneous injection of CCl 4 twice a week for 6 weeks. Rivaroxaban significantly restored the biochemical parameter including inflammatory and fibrosis markers with histopathological evidence using routine and Masson trichrome staining. It reduced also the expression of tissue factor, fibrin, transforming growth factor and α-smooth muscle actin in the liver tissues. This concludes that rivaroxaban attenuates liver injury caused by CCl 4 , at least in part by inhibiting coagulation and proinflammatory activation. In conclusion, rivaroxaban may be used for the management of liver fibrosis."

Recent studies have shown that the covert process of volitional action preparation can be decoded from overt fixational eye movements of fixational/microsaccades and pupil dilation. Ocular drift, the slowest fixational eye movements, is also under the active neural control, but its relationship with cognitive behavior is unknown. Here, we examined whether ocular drift also reflects volitional action preparation. We analyzed ocular drift while adult humans maintained fixation on a central visual stimulus as they prepared to generate a volitional saccade. We adopted the antisaccade paradigm in which subjects generate a targeting saccade toward the opposite direction of a peripheral visual stimulus. Our findings are the following five points. First, ocular drift was slower when subjects prepared for targeting saccade initiation than when such preparation was unnecessary. Second, ocular drift was slowed down with elapsed time from fixation initiation, which was associated with the facilitation of targeting saccade initiation. Third, ocular drift was further slowed on correct antisaccade trials than when subjects failed to suppress targeting saccades toward peripheral stimuli. Fourth, such correlation with antisaccade performance was observed immediately after fixation initiation in ocular drift, but it emerged more slowly in the other fixational eye movements. Fifth, subjects with unstable fixation because of faster ocular drift had poorer antisaccade performance. We suggest that fixation stability measured by ocular drift can be used to decode the covert process of volitional action preparation along with the other fixational eye movements.",Quality of care assessment for people with multimorbidity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719790,Journal of internal medicine,2019 02 27,"Multimorbidity, the simultaneous presence of multiple health conditions in an individual, is an increasingly common phenomenon globally. The systematic assessment of the quality of care delivered to people with multimorbidity will be key to informing the organization of services for meeting their complex needs. Yet, current assessments tend to focus on single conditions and do not capture the complex processes that are required for providing care for people with multimorbidity. We conducted a scoping review on quality of care and multimorbidity in selected databases in June 2018 and identified 87 documents as eligible for review, predominantly original research and reviews from North America, Europe and Australasia and mostly frequently related to primary care settings. We synthesized data qualitatively in terms of perceived challenges, evidence and proposed metrics. Findings reveal that the association between quality of care and multimorbidity is complex and depends on the conditions involved (quality appears to be higher for those with concordant conditions, and lower in the presence of discordant conditions) and the approach used for measuring quality (quality appears to be higher in people with multimorbidity when measured using condition/drug-specific process or intermediate outcome indicators, and worse when using patient-centred reports of experiences of care). People with discordant multimorbidity may be disadvantaged by current approaches to quality assessment, particularly when they are linked to financial incentives. A better understanding of models of care that best meet the needs of this group is needed for developing appropriate quality assessment frameworks. Capturing patient preferences and values and incorporate patients' voices in the form of patient-reported experiences and outcomes of care will be critical towards the achievement of high-performing health systems that are responsive to the needs of people with multimorbidity.","Identifying support needs to improve rural dementia services for people with dementia and their carers: A consultation study in Victoria, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719789,The Australian journal of rural health,2019 06 13,"The support and service needs of people with dementia and their carers are not always addressed in rural regions, yet family carers play an important role in supporting the person living with dementia to remain living in their own home.

Currently, OCT angiography (OCTA) combines structural information with the visualization of blood flow within the imaged area. The aim of this review is to present the basic principles of OCT and OCTA interpretation and to investigate the role of these imaging techniques in the diagnosis and management of uveitis. Common complications of intraocular inflammation such as macular oedema and inflammatory choroidal neovascularization are often diagnosed and followed with OCT/OCTA scans. However, uveitis specialists can obtain much more information from tomographic scans. This review provides a comprehensive description of typical OCT/OCTA findings characterizing different ocular structures in uveitis, proceeding from the cornea to the choroid. A careful interpretation of OCT/OCTA images can help in the differential diagnosis, the prediction of clinical outcomes, and the follow-up of patients with uveitis.","Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis for characterization of lignin oligomers using cationization techniques and 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP) matrix.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719787,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,2019 03 19,"Effective analytical techniques are needed to characterize lignin products for the generation of renewable carbon sources.

In the present study, we identified and characterized a cDNA encoding a putative nuclear receptor protein (Locusta migratoria hormone receptor 39, LmHR39) based on L. migratoria transcriptomics data. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that LmHR39 shows low-level expression in the early days of fifth-instar nymphs, and peak expression occurs on day 5, which is followed by a decrease before ecdysis. LmHR39 transcription could be induced by 20E in vivo and was significantly suppressed by knocking down the expression of the L. migratoria ecdysone receptor gene and early-late gene LmHR3. After RNA interference of LmHR39 with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), 85% of the insects showed abnormal morphology, with curly wings after moulting and delayed eclosion time. Haematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that apolysis of the integument and wing pad cuticle in the dsLmHR39-treated insects was delayed compared to that in the dsRNA for green fluorescent protein-injected control. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis showed the expression level of carboxypeptidase genes (Carboxypeptidase A (CPA) and Carboxypeptidase M (CPM)) and chitin degrading genes (LmChitinase5 (LmCHT5) and LmChitinase10 (LmCHT10)) dramatically declined in the dsLmHR39-treated insects, implying that the LmHR39-mediated 20E signalling pathway is involved in the regulation of carboxypeptidase genes (CPA and CPM) and chitinase genes (LmCHT5 and LmCHT10), and participated in apolysis of the integument and wing pads during locust moulting.",Validating an algorithm for multiple myeloma based on administrative data using a SEER tumor registry and medical record review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719785,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2019 02 12,Large numbers of multiple myeloma patients can be studied in real-world clinical settings using administrative databases.

Transgenic rice expressing Cry1A, Cry2A and Cry1C toxins have been developed that are lethal to Chilo suppressalis, a devastating insect pest of rice in China. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the interactions of Cry toxins with susceptible hosts will improve both our understanding of Cry protein toxicology and long-term efficacy of Bt crops. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that V-ATPase subunit A contributes to the action of Cry1Ab/1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca toxins in C. suppressalis. The full-length V-ATPase subunit A transcript was initially cloned from the C. suppressalis larval midgut and then used to generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-producing bacteria. Toxicity assays using transgenic rice lines TT51 (Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac fusion genes), T2A-1 (Cry2Aa), and T1C-19 (Cry1Ca) in conjunction with V-ATPase subunit A dsRNA-treated C. suppressalis larvae revealed significantly reduced larval susceptibility to T2A-1 and T1C-19 transgenic rice, but not to TT51 rice. These results suggest that the V-ATPase subunit A plays a crucial role in mediating Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca toxicity in C. suppressalis. These findings will have significant implications on the development of future resistance management tools.","Comparison of the Accuracy of Fit of Metal, Zirconia, and Lithium Disilicate Crowns Made from Different Manufacturing Techniques.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719780,Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,2019 06 14,"To evaluate the accuracy of fit of metal, lithium disilicate, and zirconia crowns, which were produced using different manufacturing techniques."

Transcriptional analyses have been conducted to analyze the gene expression data. However, the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) method has not been applied to determine the transcriptional consequence of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with severe OSA. The aim of this study was to identify key pathways and genes in patients with OSA that are influenced by CPAP treatment and uncover/unveil potential molecular mechanisms using WGCNA. We analyzed the microarray data of OSA (GSE 49800) listed in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Coexpression modules were constructed using WGCNA. In addition, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were also conducted. After the initial data processing, 5101 expressed gene profiles were identified. Next, a weighted gene coexpression network was established and 16 modules of coexpressed genes were identified. The interaction analysis demonstrated a relative independence of gene expression in these modules. The black module, tan module, midnightblue module, pink module, and greenyellow module were significantly associated with the alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression at baseline and after exposure to CPAP. The five hub genes were considered to be candidate OSA-related genes after CPAP treatment. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that steroid biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the insulin signaling pathway play critical roles in the development of OSA in circulating leukocyte gene expression at baseline and after exposure to CPAP. Using this new systems biology approach, we identified several genes and pathways that appear to be critical to OSA after CPAP treatment, and these findings provide a better understanding of OSA pathogenesis.",C1qTNF-related protein-6 protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719766,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its toxic effect. However, there is no specific drug that can prevent DOX-related cardiac injury. C1qTNF-related protein-6 (CTRP6) is a newly identified adiponectin paralog with many protective functions on metabolism and cardiovascular diseases. However, little is known about the effect of CTRP6 on DOX-induced cardiac injury. The present study aimed to investigate whether CTRP6 could protect against DOX-related cardiotoxicity. To induce acute cardiotoxicity, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of DOX (15 mg/kg). Cardiomyocyte-specific CTRP6 overexpression was achieved using an adenoassociated virus system at 4 weeks before DOX injection. The data in our study demonstrated that CTRP6 messenger RNA and protein expression were decreased in DOX-treated hearts. CTRP6 attenuated cardiac atrophy induced by DOX injection and inhibited cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac function in vivo. CTRP6 also promoted the activation of protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) signaling pathway in DOX-treated mice. CTRP6 prevented cardiomyocytes from DOX-induced apoptosis and activated the AKT pathway in vitro. CTRP6 lost its protection against DOX-induced cardiac injury in mice with AKT inhibition. In conclusion, CTRP6 protected the heart from DOX-cardiotoxicity and improves cardiac function via activation of the AKT signaling pathway.",Erlotinib inhibits colon cancer metastasis through inactivation of TrkB-dependent ERK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719765,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 05,"The distal metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with colon cancer. Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) and ERK signals may be the potential targets for the treatment of colon cancer metastasis. This study aims to investigate whether erlotinib inhibits distant metastasis of colon cancer by regulating TrkB and ERK signaling pathway. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (SW480 and Caco-2) pretreated with exogenous C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) were used to assess the suppressive effect of erlotinib on tumor metastasis, including anoikis, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), migration, and invasion. Through TrkB overexpression, Akt suppression, and ERK suppression, the roles of TrkB, Akt, and ERK in erlotinib-induced metastasis inhibition of colon cancer cells were explored. The results showed that erlotinib alleviated CXCL8-induced metastasis of the colon cancer cells. Overexpression of TrkB in colon cancer cells eliminated the effect of erlotinib on anoikis, inhibition of EMT, migration, and invasion, and downregulation of p-ERK and p-Akt. Furthermore, the inhibition of ERK activation instead of Akt activation was found to participate in erlotinib-mediated metastasis resistance, including anoikis, inhibition of EMT, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, erlotinib inhibits colon cancer cell anoikis resistance, EMT, migration, and invasion by inactivating TrkB-dependent ERK signaling pathway.",A Technique to Simultaneously Fabricate Multiple Custom Impression Posts for Implant-Supported Restorations in the Esthetic Zone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719764,Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,2019 03 12,"Peri-implant transmucosal tissue, an essential element of peri-implant esthetics, is critical to the success of prostheses in the esthetic zone.

The phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) can significantly promote artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua. AabHLH1 can bind and activate artemisinin biosynthetic genes, such as AaADS and AaCYP71AV1. In this study, we proved that AabHLH1 was responsive to MeJA treatment and highly expressed in glandular trichome-enriched tissues, and that its expression profile was similar to that of AaADS. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that AabHLH1 interacted with all nine AaJAZ proteins in A. annua. Functional analysis with transgenic plants showed that several artemisinin biosynthetic genes were upregulated in AabHLH1-OE transgenic A. annua lines and downregulated in AabHLH1-EAR lines; furthermore, the artemisinin content was increased in the AabHLH1-OE lines and decreased in the AabHLH1-EAR lines. These results demonstrate that the JA-induced AabHLH1 positively regulates artemisinin biosynthesis by regulating the biosynthetic genes, and thus provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of JA-induced artemisinin biosynthesis in A. annua.",Enhanced expression of circ_0000267 in hepatocellular carcinoma indicates poor prognosis and facilitates cell progression by sponging miR-646.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719761,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 05,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive carcinoma worldwide.

However, time-resolved techniques can access only a limited temporal window, and often contradict steady-state measurements. Here, commonly employed steady-state and time-resolved techniques are unified over an exceptionally wide temporal range (fs-µs) in a consistent physical picture. Experimental evidence confirmed by numerical simulations shows that, although various techniques probe different time scales, they are mutually consistent as they probe the same physical mechanisms governing charge motion in disordered media-carrier hopping and thermalization in a disorder-broadened density of states (DOS). The generality of this framework is highlighted by time-resolved experimental data obtained on polymer:fullerene, polymer:polymer, and small-molecule blends with varying morphology, including recent experiments revealing that low donor content OPV devices operate by long-range hole tunneling between non-nearest-neighbor molecules. The importance of nonequilibrium processes in organic electronic materials is reviewed, with a particular focus on experimental data and understanding charge transport physics in terms of material DOS.","Frequency of Occurrence of the Rat Lungworm Parasite in the Invasive Island Apple Snail in South Carolina, USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719754,Journal of aquatic animal health,2019 03 01,"The rat lungworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a nematode parasite that can cause potentially fatal eosinophilic meningitis in humans.

Thus, evidence has suggested a potential quadratic relationship (i.e., inverted U) between reward sensitivity and risk-taking propensity. Blunted response to reward compared to loss may therefore demonstrate transdiagnostic utility as it relates to different patterns of maladaptive risk behavior. The current study sought to disentangle the relationship between risk and reward in a clinically diverse sample. In a sample of 210 adults (aged 18-30), the RewP (an ERP indexing differentiation between rewards and losses) was measured during a monetary guessing game, and risk-taking propensity was measured with a behavioral task (i.e., BART) that simulates real-world risk taking. Participants also completed clinical assessments to assess for lifetime psychopathology. Results indicated that there was no linear association between the RewP and risk-taking propensity; however, there was a significant quadratic relationship. Thus, a reduced sensitivity to reward receipt was associated with both risk-prone and risk-averse behavior. There was also a significant quadratic relationship between the RewP and money won during the BART, indicating that being too risk prone or risk averse is disadvantageous and leads to missed reward. Overall, these findings suggested that blunted neural differentiation between gains and losses may contribute to deficits in effectively weighing reward and loss and result in maladaptive risk-taking behavior. These findings support continued examination of reward dysfunction dimensionally in order to better characterize behavioral profiles implicated in clinical phenotypes.",Improvement of the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria in combination with berries/fruits and dairy industry by-products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719736,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 05 15,"By-products from berries/fruits (B/F) and the dairy industry (DI) are an important environmental issue in many countries.

Six clinically healthy, 1.5 ± 0.2 years sheep were used for the study. In pharmacokinetic study, the crossover design in three periods was performed. The withdrawal interval between the study periods was 15 days. In first period, CFQ (Cobactan, 2.5%) was administered by an intravenous (IV) bolus (3 sheep) and SC (3 sheep) injections at 2.5 mg/kg dose. In second period, the treatment administration was repeated via the opposite administration route. In third period, CFQ was administrated subcutaneously to each sheep (n = 6) at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg q. 24 hr for 5 days. Plasma concentrations of CFQ were measured using the HPLC-UV method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods. The elimination half-life and mean residence time of CFQ after the single SC administration were longer than IV administration (p < 0.05). Bioavailability (F%) of CFQ following the single SC administration was 123.51 ± 11.54%. The area under the curve (AUC0-∞ ) and peak concentration following repeated doses (last dose) were higher than those observed after the first dose (p < 0.05). CFQ accumulated after repeated SC doses. CFQ can be given via SC at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg every 24 hr for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, which minimum inhibitory concentration is ≤1.0 μg/ml in sheep.",The role of plant species and soil condition in the structural development of the rhizosphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719731,"Plant, cell & environment",2019 05 21,"Roots naturally exert axial and radial pressures during growth, which alter the structural arrangement of soil at the root-soil interface. However, empirical models suggest soil densification, which can have negative impacts on water and nutrient uptake, occurs at the immediate root surface with decreasing distance from the root. Here, we spatially map structural gradients in the soil surrounding roots using non-invasive imaging, to ascertain the role of root growth in early stage formation of soil structure. X-ray computed tomography provided a means not only to visualize a root system in situ and in 3-D but also to assess the precise root-induced alterations to soil structure close to, and at selected distances away from the root-soil interface. We spatially quantified the changes in soil structure generated by three common but contrasting plant species (pea, tomato, and wheat) under different soil texture and compaction treatments. Across the three plant types, significant increases in porosity at the immediate root surface were found in both clay loam and loamy sand soils and not soil densification, the currently assumed norm. Densification of the soil was recorded, at some distance away from the root, dependent on soil texture and plant type. There was a significant soil texture × bulk density × plant species interaction for the root convex hull, a measure of the extent to which root systems explore the soil, which suggested pea and wheat grew better in the clay soil when at a high bulk density, compared with tomato, which preferred lower bulk density soils. These results, only revealed by high resolution non-destructive imagery, show that although the root penetration mechanisms can lead to soil densification (which could have a negative impact on growth), the immediate root-soil interface is actually a zone of high porosity, which is very important for several key rhizosphere processes occurring at this scale including water and nutrient uptake and gaseous diffusion.",A surface-in gradient of thalamic damage evolves in pediatric multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719730,Annals of neurology,2019 02 28,"Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward.

However, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in various cutaneous lupus erythematosus subtypes in Japanese patients has not been elucidated to date. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations according to CLE subtypes in Japanese patients. We enrolled 35 patients (29 diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and six with CLE) in this retrospective study. We analyzed the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations according to cutaneous lupus erythematosus subtypes, time to the first skin improvement, as well as effects on laboratory data and reduction of concomitant immunosuppressive drug administration at 16 and 32 weeks of therapy. Complete improvement was observed at high rates for acute CLE (ACLE); however, partial or non-improvement rates were higher for chronic CLE (CCLE) at 16 weeks. Several patients with alopecia without scarring achieved complete improvement at 32 weeks. CCLE tended to take more time to improve than ACLE. Overall, hydroxychloroquine was highly effective for skin: 87% of patients had at least some beneficial response at 16 weeks. Nevertheless, there were wide variations in complete improvement rates and duration for improvement among CLE subtypes. Our findings suggest that a therapeutic approach considering the subtypes of CLE will improve its management.",Could isotretinoin flare hidradenitis suppurativa? A case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719727,Clinical and experimental dermatology,2019 03 23,"We report eight cases of patients with severe acne who were treated with isotretinoin and developed painful nodules in the axillae and groin, consistent with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The pathogenesis of HS is still not completely understood; recent research from a study in 2011 of biopsies from HS lesions showed a reduction or absence of sebaceous glands compared with normal skin in patients with HS, with the report suggesting that this contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. Interestingly, the main effect of isotretinoin is to decrease the size and action of sebaceous glands, so hypothetically, as isotretinoin acts by reducing the sebaceous glands further it could potentially aggravate HS. Our experience has instilled caution in our prescribing of isotretinoin, and we question patients, particularly those with acne conglobata, about symptoms of HS prior to and during treatment."

The survival rates for osteosarcoma remain unchanged over the past two decades. Studies aiming to find new or alternative therapies for patients with refractory osteosarcoma are urgently needed. Anlotinib, a novel multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has exhibited encouraging clinical activity in NSLCC and soft tissue sarcoma, whereas its effect on osteosarcoma has not been studied. In our study, we investigated the anti-tumor activity and underlying mechanism of anlotinib in osteosarcoma. Various in vitro and in vivo models of human osteosarcoma were used to determine the anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastasis efficacy of anlotinib. Our results showed that anlotinib suppressed tumor growth and increased the chemo-sensitivity of osteosarcoma. In addition, anlotinib inhibited migration and invasion in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, in order to explore the anti-tumor mechanism of anlotinib, phospho-RTK antibody arrays were performed. These analyses confirmed that anlotinib suppressed the phosphorylation of MET, VEGFR2 and the downstream signaling pathway activation. Moreover, we demonstrated that anlotinib blocked hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration, invasion and VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Notably, a 143B-Luc orthotopic osteosarcoma model further showed that anlotinib significantly inhibited growth and lung metastasis of implanted tumor cells. Our preclinical work indicates that anlotinib acts as a novel inhibitor of VEGFR2 and MET that blocks tumorigenesis in osteosarcoma, which could be translated into future clinical trials.",Comparison of efficiency of direct observations by scuba diver and indirect observations via video camera for measuring reef-fish behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719714,Journal of fish biology,2019 05 08,"The present study investigates how the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus, subject of a large number of ecological, evolutionary and behavioural studies, responds to the presence of human observers (effect of scuba diver presence-absence) and how the method of data collection (directly by a scuba diver v. indirectly via video camera) may affect the quality of behavioural data. Scuba diver presence had only subtle effects on fish behaviour. The efficiency of the method of scoring fish behaviour depended on the behaviour under consideration: those behaviours that occur in close proximity to the corals were scored more effectively directly by a scuba diver while those that are performed in a more rapid or repetitive fashion were scored more effectively indirectly via video camera. These results provide a foundation for future behavioural research on D. aruanus and other fishes where scuba divers or video cameras are the prevalent means of data collection.",Genetic variants at the EGLN1 locus associated with high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans are absent or found at low frequency in highland Andeans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719713,Annals of human genetics,2019 04 02,"EGLN1 encodes the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) that serves as an oxygen-sensitive regulator of HIF activity. The EGLN1 locus exhibits a signature of positive selection in Tibetan and Andean populations and is associated with hemoglobin concentration in Tibetans. Recent reports provide evidence for functional roles of protein-coding variants within the first exon of EGLN1 (rs186996510, rs12097901) that are linked to an adaptive signal in Tibetans, yet whether these same variants are present and contribute to adaptation in Andean highlanders is unknown. We determined the frequencies of these adaptive Tibetan alleles in Quechua Andeans resident at high altitude (4,350 m) in addition to individuals of Nepali ancestry resident at sea level. The rs186996510 C (minor) allele previously found at high frequency in Tibetans is absent in Andean (G: 100%) and rare among Nepali (C: 11.8%, G: 88.2%) cohorts. The minor G allele of rs12097901 is found at similarly low frequencies in Andeans (G: 12.7%, C: 87.3%) and Nepalis (G: 23.5%, C: 76.5%) compared to Tibetans. These results suggest that adaptation involving EGLN1 in Andeans involves different mechanisms than those described in Tibetans.

The present methylation and association study followed up a recent report highlighting that the BRD2 promoter CpG island (CpG76) is differentially hypermethylated in lymphoblastoid cells from Caucasian patients with JME compared to patients with other GGE subtypes and unaffected relatives. In contrast, we found a uniform low average percentage of methylation (<4.5%) for 13 CpG76-CpGs in whole blood cells from 782 unrelated European Caucasians, including 116 JME patients, 196 patients with genetic absence epilepsies, and 470 control subjects.

We examined occurrence of HPV types among vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups of 1992-1994 birth cohorts with differing acquisition risks up to 9 years post-implementation of HPV vaccination in 33 Finnish communities randomized to: Arm A (gender-neutral HPV16/18 vaccination), Arm B (girls-only HPV16/18 vaccination and hepatitis B-virus (HBV) vaccination of boys), and Arm C (gender-neutral HBV vaccination). Out of 1992-1994 born resident boys (31,117) and girls (30,139), 8,618 boys and 15,615 girls were vaccinated, respectively, with 20-30% and 50% coverage in 2007-2009.

We timed bladder cancer drivers, mutational signatures, ploidy and copy number alterations, provided evidence for kataegis and correlated alterations with tumour areas and histological phenotypes. We found that: (1) heterogeneous tumour areas/phenotypes had distinct driver mutations, (2) papillary-invasive tumours divided early into two parallel evolving branches and (3) parallel evolution of subclonal driver mutations occurred. APOBEC mutational signatures were found to be very early events, active in carcinoma in situ, and often remained a dominant source of mutations throughout tumour evolution. Genetic progression from carcinoma in situ followed driver mutations in NA13/FAT1, ZBTB7B or EP300/USP28/KMT2D. Our results point towards a more diverse mutational trajectory of bladder tumorigenesis and underpin the importance of timing of mutational processes and clonal architecture in bladder cancer as important aspects for successful prognostication and therapy.

Serotonergic abnormalities have also recently been observed in human SUDEP. Fenfluramine is a drug that enhances serotonin release in the brain. Recent studies have found that the addition of fenfluramine improved seizure control in patients with Dravet syndrome, which has a high incidence of SUDEP.

The chemoresistance and metastasis are attributed to a rare subpopulation with enriched stem-like characteristics, thus called Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). We have previously reported aberrant expression of the actin-bundling protein (fascin) in breast cancer cells, which enhances their chemoresistance, metastasis and enriches CSC population. The intracellular mechanisms that link fascin with its downstream effectors are not fully elucidated. Here, loss and gain of function approaches in two different breast cancer models were used to understand how fascin promotes disease progression. Importantly, findings were aligned with expression data from actual breast cancer patients. Expression profiling of a large breast cancer dataset (TCGA, 530 patients) showed statistically significant correlation between fascin expression and a key adherence molecule, β1 integrin (ITGB1). In vitro manipulation of fascin expression in breast cancer cells exhibited its direct effect on ITGB1 expression. Fascin-mediated regulation of ITGB1 was critical for several breast cancer cell functions including adhesion to different extracellular matrix, self-renewability and chemoresistance. Importantly, there was a significant relationship between fascin and ITGB1 co-expression and short disease-free as well as overall survival in chemo-treated breast cancer patients. This novel role of fascin effect on ITGB1 expression and its outcome on cell self-renewability and chemoresistance strongly encourages for dual targeting of fascin-ITGB1 axis as a therapeutic approach to halt breast cancer progression and eradicate it from the root."

We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant's year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings.

Nevertheless, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) does not equate to normal function of the knee or reduced risk of subsequent injuries. In fact, recent evidence has shown that only around half of post-ACLR patients can expect to return to competitive level of sports. A rising concern is the high rate of second ACL injuries, particularly in young athletes, with up to 20% of those returning to sport in the first year from surgery experiencing a second ACL rupture. Aside from the increased risk of second injury, patients after ACLR have an increased risk of developing early onset of osteoarthritis. Given the recent findings, it is imperative that rehabilitation after ACLR is scrutinized so the second injury preventative strategies can be optimized. Unfortunately, current ACLR rehabilitation programs may not be optimally effective in addressing deficits related to the initial injury and the subsequent surgical intervention. Motor learning to (re-)acquire motor skills and neuroplastic capacities are not sufficiently incorporated during traditional rehabilitation, attesting to the high re-injury rates. The purpose of this article is to present novel clinically integrated motor learning principles to support neuroplasticity that can improve patient functional performance and reduce the risk of second ACL injury. The following key concepts to enhance rehabilitation and prepare the patient for re-integration to sports after an ACL injury that is as safe as possible are presented: (1) external focus of attention, (2) implicit learning, (3) differential learning, (4) self-controlled learning and contextual interference. The novel motor learning principles presented in this manuscript may optimize future rehabilitation programs to reduce second ACL injury risk and early development of osteoarthritis by targeting changes in neural networks.",Effects of Catheterization on Artery Function and Health: When Should Patients Start Exercising Following Their Coronary Intervention?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719682,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 02 28,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; angioplasty) are commonly used to diagnose and/or treat the obstructed coronaries. Exercise-based rehabilitation is recommended for all CAD patients; however, most guidelines do not specify when exercise training should commence following PTCA and/or PCI. Catheterization can result in arterial dysfunction and acute injury, and given the fact that exercise, particularly at higher intensities, is associated with elevated inflammatory and oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and a pro-thrombotic milieu, performing exercise post-PTCA/PCI may transiently elevate the risk of cardiac events. This review aims to summarize extant literature relating to the impacts of coronary interventions on arterial function, including the time-course of recovery and the potential deleterious and/or beneficial impacts of acute versus long-term exercise. The current literature suggests that arterial dysfunction induced by catheterization recovers 4-12 weeks following catheterization. This review proposes that a period of relative arterial vulnerability may exist and exercise during this period may contribute to elevated event susceptibility. We therefore suggest that CAD patients start an exercise training programme between 2 and 4 weeks post-PCI, recognizing that the literature suggest there is a 'grey area' for functional recovery between 2 and 12 weeks post-catheterization. The timing of exercise onset should take into consideration the individual characteristics of patients (age, severity of disease, comorbidities) and the intensity, frequency and duration of the exercise prescription.",Implications of sequence variation on the evolution of rRNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719681,"Chromosome research : an international journal on the molecular, supramolecular and evolutionary aspects of chromosome biology",2019 06 10,"The evolution of the multi-copy family of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is unique in regard to its genetics and genome evolution.

In these studies, category exemplars contained two relevant and two irrelevant features; therefore, category density (specifically, the relevant to irrelevant information ratio) was relatively high. Here, we manipulated category density both between and within subjects by keeping constant the amount of relevant information (one feature) and varying the amount of irrelevant information (one or three features). One group of pigeons started with low-density training, then proceeded to high-density training, and finally returned to low-density training (Low-High-Low); a second group of pigeons started with high-density training and then proceeded to low-density training (High-Low). The statistical density of the category exemplars had a large effect on pigeons' performance. Training with high-density exemplars greatly benefitted category learning. Accuracy rose faster and to a higher level with high-density training than with low-density training; the percentage of relevant pecks showed a very similar pattern. In addition, high-density training (in the Low-High-Low group) led to an increase in performance on the more difficult low-density task, an observation reminiscent of the easy-to-hard effect.

The adversity of Al was increased in a dose-dependent manner and the highest was recorded at 750 μM AlCl3. Despite the significant loss in membrane integrity (80% electrolyte leakage) due to an enhanced generation of H2O2, A. microphylla reflected only 50% growth inhibition (fresh and dry weight) at 500 μM AlCl3 (LD50). However, the average root length of Azolla was drastically reduced at high concentration due to their direct contact with aluminum-containing growth medium. Contrary to this, the whole association maintained moderate chlorophyll, carbohydrate content, photosynthetic efficiency, nitrogen-fixing ability, and nitrogen content at high Al concentration. Probably, growth protection was pertained through significant detoxification of H2O2 by employing an efficient antioxidative defense system including antioxidative enzymes (SOD, APX, and CAT) and non-enzymatic antioxidant carotenoids. An enhanced level of phenolics and flavonoids in the root exudates possibly maintained a non-toxic level of aluminum inside the cell (195.8 μg Al/g FW) which makes A. microphylla a suitable pteridophytic plant to not only remove toxic Al from the contaminated sites but also to improve nitrogen status of those regions.

The simulations were performed using the Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources/Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran watershed modeling system for two representative study watersheds delineated with both the original DEMs of four different resolutions (including 3.5, 10, 30, and 100 m) and the resampled DEMs of three different resolutions (including 10, 30, and 100 m), creating 14 simulation scenarios. Parameter uncertainties were quantified by means of the GLUE approach and compared to input data uncertainties. Results from the 14 simulation scenarios showed that there was a common increasing trend in errors of simulated flow and water quality parameters when the DEM resolution became coarser. The errors involved in the watershed with a mild slope were found to be substantially (up to 10 times) greater than those of the other watershed with a relatively steep slope. It was also found that sediment was the most sensitive and NO3 was the least sensitive parameters to the variation in DEM resolution, as evidenced by the maximum normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 250% in the simulated sediment concentration and 11% in the simulated NO3 concentration, respectively. Moreover, results achieved from the resampled (particularly coarser) DEMs were significantly different from corresponding ones from original DEMs. By comparing uncertainties from different sources, it was found that the parameter-induced uncertainties were higher than the resolution-induced uncertainties particularly in simulated NO3 and P concentrations for studied watersheds. The findings provide new insights into the sensitivity and uncertainty of water quality parameters and their simulation results, serving as the guidelines for developing and implementing water quality management and watershed restoration plans.",The possible neuroprotective effects of melatonin in aluminum chloride-induced neurotoxicity via antioxidant pathway and Nrf2 signaling apart from metal chelation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719664,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 16,"Aluminum (Al) had well-identified adverse influences on the nervous system mainly through the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Melatonin works as an antioxidant through the inhibition of ROS and attenuating peroxidation of lipids. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal transcription factor which controls the transcription of antioxidant enzymes. This study was conducted to determine the potential neuroprophylactic impacts of melatonin in aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-initiated neurotoxicity including potential mechanism(s) of action and relevant signaling in rats. Thirty-six male rats were distributed into 4 groups: Control; AlCl3 (50 mg/kg bwt, i.p, 3 times weekly for 3 months); melatonin (5 mg/kg bwt, i.p daily for 2 weeks before AlCl3 and sustained for the next 3 months); and melatonin with AlCl3. Neuronal alterations were histopathologically and biochemically evaluated. The neuronal antioxidant-related genes and relevant Nrf2 protein expression were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The current data showed a substantial increase in brain damage biomarkers, acetylecholinesterase (AchE) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content while the enzymatic antioxidant expression as glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were substantially attenuated in the aluminum-treated group, with cleared histopathological changes as inflammatory cell infiltration with neuronal degeneration. Supplementation of melatonin resulted in an obvious amelioration in all previous abnormal alteration observed in AlCl3-treated rats rather than increased Al burden and/or altered Fe and Cu homeostasis with upregulating both total and phosphorylated Nrf2 expression. Therefore, the study concluded that melatonin has a potential ability to be neuroprophylactic against Al-induced neurotoxic effect and oxidative damage in the rat brain through upregulating and instigating Nrf2 signaling apart from metal chelation.",Characteristics and management modes of domestic waste in rural areas of developing countries: a case study of China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719663,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 10,"A huge accumulation of domestic waste has caused serious environmental contamination in rural areas of developing countries (RADIC). The characteristics and management of domestic waste are carefully discussed, based on field surveys and a literature review. The results indicate that the generation in most of RADIC is less than the median of 0.521 kg day-1 per capita in China, and much smaller than in rural areas of developed countries (RADEC). Organic waste and inert waste with an accumulative mass percentage of 72.31% are dominant components of domestic waste in the rural areas of China. There are trends of increasing amounts of kitchen waste, paper/cardboard, and plastic/rubber and a decreasing trend of ash waste. The RADIC composition of domestic waste had a high content of organic waste and a low content of recyclable waste compared to the RADEC. Domestic waste has good compressibility and a light bulk density ranging from 40 to 650 kg m-3. The moisture, ash, combustible, and calorific values of domestic waste were 53.31%, 18.03%, 28.67%, and 5368 kJ kg-1, respectively. The domestic waste has an abundance of nutrients including organic matter (39.05%), nitrogen (1.02%), phosphorus (0.50%), and potassium (1.42%). In RADIC, domestic waste can be used as an agricultural manure only after it has been collected and sorted for the potential risk of heavy metal accumulation. Based on these characteristics of domestic waste and the different situations of rural areas, four waste management modes including centralized treatment, decentralized treatment, group treatment, and mobile treatment are designed and discussed.",Liver disorders related to exposure to gasoline fumes in male rats and role of fenugreek seed supplementation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719662,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 16,"Progressive effects of inhalation of gasoline fumes on the liver and the protective potential with fenugreek seed supplementation were evaluated in adult male rats. Twenty-four rats were divided into four groups, unexposed control and fenugreek groups, as well as exposed groups to gasoline fumes for 6 h/6 days/week for 10 weeks, with and without supplementation of fenugreek seed powder in food (5%w/w). Exposure to gasoline fumes resulted in a significant elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein, along with a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein, total protein, and albumin contents compared to the control. Meanwhile, liver oxidative stress markers, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide, were highly detected with decreased antioxidants, superoxide dismutase and catalase. Also, levels of inflammatory markers, interleukin(IL)-1β and IL-6, were significantly elevated with fibrotic markers, transforming growth factor (TGFβ1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF1), and collagen I. Histopathological studies illustrated that rats exposed to gasoline fumes have degenerated hepatocytes with cellular infiltration and necrotic areas, along with remarkable deposition of collagen fibers, suggesting an incidence of liver fibrosis. Administration of fenugreek seeds, rich with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory components, during gasoline exposure showed significant amelioration through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation.","Assessment of acute toxicity and cytotoxicity of fluorescent markers produced by cardanol and glycerol, which are industrial waste, to different biological models.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719661,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 10,"The amphyphylic triazoanilines recently synthesized 1-(4-(3-aminophenyl)-1H-1,2,3- triazole-1-yl)-3-(3-pentadecylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (1) and 1-(4-(4-aminophenyl)-1H- 1,2,3-triazole-1-yl)-3-(3-pentadecylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (2), synthesized from cardanol and glycerol, have photophysical properties which allow their use in the development of fluorescent biomarkers with applicability in the biodiesel quality control. Based on this, the present research evaluated the toxic effects of both compounds in different biological models through the investigation of survival and mortality percentages as a measure of acute toxicity on Daphnia similis and Oreochromis niloticus, larvicidal assay against Aedes aegypti, and cytotoxic activity on mammary cells. Results demonstrate that these triazoanilines 1 and 2 have shown low acute toxicity to the biological models investigated in this study up to the following concentrations: 4.0 mg L-1 (D. similis), 4.0 mg L-1 (A. aegypti larvae), 1.0 mg L-1 (O. niloticus), and 1.0 mg mL-1 (mammary cells). This fact suggests the potential for safe use of compounds 1 and 2 as fluorescent markers for the monitoring of biodiesel quality, even in the case of environmental exposure. Besides all of that, the reuse of cardanol and glycerol, both industrial wastes, favors the maintenance of environmental health and is in agreement with the assumptions of green chemistry.

Often, the sterilization process of wastewater includes the addition of sodium hypochlorite that can react with PCPPs and other organic matter (i.e., dissolve organic matter) to generate disinfection by-products and can cause the final effluent to be more harmful to aquatic organisms. Here, we exposed Daphnia magna to two stages of wastewater, the pre-chlorinated wastewater (PreCl) and the final effluent. In addition, we exposed D. magna, to the final effluent with a concentration gradient of added PFOS, to investigate if this persistent contaminant altered the toxicity of the final effluent. After 48 h of contaminant exposure, we measured the daphnids metabolic responses to the different stages of wastewater treatment, and with the addition of PFOS, utilizing proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found few significant changes to the metabolic profile of animals exposed to the PreCl wastewater; however, animals exposed to the final effluent displayed increases in many amino acids and decreases in some sugar metabolites. With the addition of PFOS to the final effluent, the metabolic profile shifted from increased amino acids and decreased sugar metabolites and energy molecules especially at the low and high concentrations of PFOS. Overall, our results demonstrate the metabolome is sensitive to changes in the final effluent that are caused by sterilization, and with the addition of a persistent contaminant, the metabolic profile is further altered.","Leaving footprints, not scars: a qualitative pilot study of Hispanic mothers' willingness to communicate with dependent children about an advanced cancer diagnosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719659,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2019 04 15,"US Hispanics are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer as parents than their non-Hispanic white counterparts but little is known about Hispanic parents' willingness to discuss a terminal cancer diagnosis with dependent children, potentially resulting in suboptimal child coping.

In this constant crosstalk between the human host and its microbiome, a bidirectional relationship has been established. The microorganisms provide the host with functions it cannot perform on its own and at the same time the host provides its microbes with a suitable environment for their growth and development. These host factors can positively affect the microbiome, promoting diversity and balance between different species, resulting in a state of symbiosis and absence of pathology. In contrast, other host factors can negatively influence the composition of the oral microbiome and drive the interaction towards a dysbiotic state, where the balance tilts towards a harmful relationship between the host and its microbiome.

Previous trials with extended-duration thromboprophylaxis using enoxaparin, apixaban, and rivaroxaban failed to achieve acceptable net clinical benefit, largely due to excess of major bleeding. Betrixaban is a novel factor Xa inhibitor with unique pharmacokinetic properties, including low renal clearance, long half-life, and low peak-to-trough ratio. The phase III APEX trial (N = 7513) compared a betrixaban 160 mg loading dose followed by 80 mg once daily for 35-42 days, with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 6-14 days; the betrixaban dose was reduced for renal impairment or a concomitant strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. The primary efficacy endpoint of composite thrombotic events was not different between treatment arms in cohort 1 (D-dimer ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal). Subsequent exploratory analyses showed a statistically significant difference favoring betrixaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism and net clinical benefit in the overall population. For the primary safety outcome, betrixaban did not significantly increase major bleeding compared with enoxaparin. Based on available data from the APEX trial and subanalyses, the use of betrixaban in patients similar to those enrolled in the APEX trial can reduce the risk of thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of major bleeding.

Rapid reconstitution packages (RRPs) are new devices, designed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to optimize fluid mixing, integrating physical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), excipients and diluents. RRPs improve drug stability for long-term storage and ease of delivery. Device prototypes were manufactured using advanced stereolithography apparatus (SLA) 3D printing technology. Reconstitution of glucagon with RRPs was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and optical spectroscopy methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to test in vitro activity. Experimental results showed that RRPs effectively reconstituted glucagon even after exposure to 60 °C for a 24-h period. RRPs exhibited improved performance at maintaining drug stability compared to lyophilized glucagon stored in a standard glass vial under the same temperature conditions. RRPs represent a portable platform for rapid reconstitution of lyophilized drugs, compatible with standard syringes available in any clinical setting. The RRP provides an alternative to manual reconstitution process, especially designed for medical emergencies."

Dust samples were collected from sign boards of the heavy traffic road connecting Dhanbad and Sindri. The total PAHs (∑PAHs, all values in mg/kg) content in the road dust samples varied from 3.98 to 13.1, with carcinogenic PAHs content of 14.8-34.4% of the ∑PAHs. Phenanthrene (2.72), fluorene (0.715) and pyrene (0.575) are the major PAHs. Principal component analysis revealed that these PAHs are probably originated from pyrogenic (coal combustion and traffic emission) and petrogenic (coal dust, tyre and road particles) sources. Among the PTEs, the mean content was higher for Ba (293 mg/kg) followed by Zn (224), Pb (128), Cu (52.6), Cr (45.2), Ni (22.0), As (17.5) and Co (8.11).

The results suggested that the nutritional value of fermented WVR was higher for mutton sheep as roughage feed than that of unfermented WVR. The effective degradability (ED) of DM was higher (P < 0.05) in sheep with fermented WVR-based diet. The ED of CP and NDF of fermented WVR was reduced (P < 0.01) compared with the unfermented WVR. The results further suggested that the fermentation improved the degradability of WVR, and the rumen degradability of protein by ruminal flora decreased in fermented WVR, saving more protein for the sheep post-ruminal digestion and absorption. Furthermore, the results presented here clearly indicated the potential of fermented WVR by N. sitophila as an unconventional and functional feedstuff with rich carotenoid for ruminants, which could reduce WVR discharge in vinegar brewing industry and improve ruminant production. This work laid a foundation for the development of ruminant carotenoid functional feed.",Differences Over Time in the Prognostic Effect of Return to Work Self-Efficacy on a Sustained Return to Work.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719610,Journal of occupational rehabilitation,2019 02 05,"Purpose This study investigated the association between return to work self-efficacy (RTW-SE) and sustained return to work (RTW) at two different time points, over a 12-month period. The primary objective of the study was to examine if the relationship between RTW-SE and a sustained RTW changed over the RTW timeline. Methods This study used survey responses from a longitudinal cohort of n = 410 workers' compensation claimants with either an upper-body musculoskeletal injury or a psychological injury. A path analysis tested the associations between RTW-SE and a sustained RTW at two time-points. A Wald χ2 test compared nested models to determine if the association changed over time. Results RTW-SE measured at time- point 1 (T1) was associated with a sustained RTW at time-point two (T2) (β = 0.24, P < 0.05) but no association was found between RTW-SE at T2 and a sustained RTW at time-point three (T3) (β = 0.017, n.s.). Model comparisons revealed significant differences in the associations between RTW-SE and a sustained RTW, with the relationship being stronger in the early phase of RTW compared to the latter phase (χ2 = 5.002, p = 0.03). Conclusions The results indicate that RTW-SE at 4-6 months post-injury is important for a sustained RTW 6-months later although RTW-SE at 10-12 months post-injury had a negligible association over the same duration. Further research should investigate whether these findings generalize to other populations and what factors other than RTW-SE are associated with RTW in the later stages of the RTW process.",Biosynthetic production of fully carbon-13 labeled retinal in E. coli for structural and functional studies of rhodopsins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719609,Journal of biomolecular NMR,2019 04 29,"The isomerization of a covalently bound retinal is an integral part of both microbial and animal rhodopsin function. As such, detailed structure and conformational changes in the retinal binding pocket are of significant interest and are studied in various NMR, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy experiments, which commonly require isotopic labeling of retinal. Unfortunately, the de novo organic synthesis of an isotopically-labeled retinal is complex and often cost-prohibitive, especially for large scale expression required for solid-state NMR. We present the novel protocol for biosynthetic production of an isotopically labeled retinal ligand concurrently with an apoprotein in E. coli as a cost-effective alternative to the de novo organic synthesis. Previously, the biosynthesis of a retinal precursor, β-carotene, has been introduced into many different organisms. We extended this system to the prototrophic E. coli expression strain BL21 in conjunction with the inducible expression of a β-dioxygenase and proteo-opsin. To demonstrate the applicability of this system, we were able to assign several new carbon resonances for proteorhodopsin-bound retinal by using fully 13C-labeled glucose as the sole carbon source. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this biosynthetically produced retinal can be extracted from E. coli cells by applying a hydrophobic solvent layer to the growth medium and reconstituted into an externally produced opsin of any desired labeling pattern.",The Quorum Quenching Bacterium Bacillus licheniformis T-1 Protects Zebrafish against Aeromonas hydrophila Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719608,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2019 02 05,"Quorum sensing, bacterial cell-to-cell communication via small signaling molecules regulates virulence in many bacterial pathogens, and is a promising target for antivirulence therapy, which may inhibit virulence rather than cell growth and division. Herein, Bacillus strains capable of degrading QS molecules from freshwater environments were screened as potential aquaculture probiotics. A total of 34 Bacillus strains were isolated. Strain T-1 was selected with ""H"" streaking and double layer agar plate methods using Chromabacterium violaceum ATCC12472 as reporter, and eventually identified as Bacillus licheniformis based on biochemical and molecular identification. Quorum quenching by T-1 was confirmed using C. violaceum CV026. T-1 was non-hemolytic in vitro. In biocontrol experiments, T-1 reduced the pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila cb15 in zebrafish co-injected intraperitoneally with both strains, achieving a relative percentage survival of 70%. Determination and analysis of the T-1 draft genome using the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform identified the quorum quenching gene ytnP, encoding an acyl-homoserine lactone metallo-β-lactamase, as a potential QS quencher in T-1. In conclusion, B. licheniformis T-1 could be a safe and effective quorum quenching bacterium for protecting hosts against pathogenic bacterial infections in aquaculture.",Predictors of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea: identification of sex differences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719607,Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,2019 02 05,"Home sleep apnea tests are recommended only for patients at high risk of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15/h).

The vast majority of patients affected by this disease does not respond or show resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs, which makes the treatment ineffective. In this sense, the necessity for the development of new agents to assist in CM therapy is extremely important. One of the sources of great interest in this search are compounds of natural origin. Among these compounds, caffeic acid has demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities as well as antitumor effects in some types of cancer. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the possible antitumor effect of caffeic acid on the SK-Mel-28 cell line, human CM cells. Cells were cultured in flasks with culture medium containing fetal bovine serum, antibiotic, and antifungal, and maintained in ideal conditions. Cells were treated with 25 µM, 50 µM, 100 µM, 150 µM and 200 µM of caffeic acid and dacarbazine at 1 mg/mL. We verified the effect on cell viability and cell death, apoptosis, cell cycle, colony formation and gene expression of caspases. Results showed a decrease in cell viability, cell death induction by apoptosis, inhibition of colony formation, modulation of cell cycle and alterations in gene expression of caspases after caffeic acid treatment. These results suggest an antitumor effect of the compound on SK-Mel-28 cells. This study provides original information on mechanisms by which caffeic acid may play a key role in preventing tumor progression in human melanoma cells.",Association of rs6259 polymorphism with SHBG levels and Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome in Indian population: a case control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719605,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 11,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy of reproductive-aged women. PCOS reflects a number of possible etiologies but its pathophysiology is still unclear. The principal abnormality of the syndrome is hyperandrogenism (70-80%). The access of androgens to target tissues is regulated by sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), a transport protein secreted by liver i.e. specific for androgens. Present study was done to find the association of rs6259 polymorphism with SHBG levels and Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome in Indian population. Present study was a case control study. 400 subjects were enrolled for the study and serum SHBG levels and D327N polymorphism were measured. The D327N polymorphism (wild-type and variant allele) was detected using PCR-RFLP method (restriction enzyme Bbs-I). PCOS group was found to have significantly lower SHBG levels than healthy controls. There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between PCOS and controls (χ2 = 1.0335, p = 0.59). Significant difference in SHBG levels of PCOS and control group highlights the potential of SHBG as a biomarker for PCOS. However, no significant difference in genotype distribution between PCOS and controls provided an insight that rs6259 polymorphism is not associated with the risk of PCOS and SHBG levels.",Suspected adverse effects after human papillomavirus vaccination: a temporal relationship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719604,Immunologic research,2019 05 15,"In Japan, a significant number of adolescent girls complained unusual symptoms after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, and the vast majority of them were initially diagnosed as having psychiatric illness because of the absence of pathologic findings, radiological images and specific abnormalities in laboratory test results. Later, these symptoms were supposed to be adverse effects after HPV vaccination, and the recommendation for HPV vaccination was withdrawn by Japanese Ministry of Public Health, Labour and Welfare 4 years and 9 months ago. However, a causal link has not been demonstrated between HPV vaccination and the development of these symptoms. Our study has shown that the period of HPV vaccination considerably overlapped with that of unique postvaccination symptom development, adding that new patients with possible HPV vaccine-related symptoms have not appeared during our recent 28-month follow-up period. This social episode has now subsided in Japan."

Radiation therapy is the most efficient means to treat this malignant tumor. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a suitable imaging technique to assess this disease. However, the large amount of data produced by numerous patients causes traditional manual delineation of tumor contour, a basic step for radiotherapy, to become time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, the demand for automatic and credible segmentation methods to alleviate the workload of radiologists is increasing. This paper presents a method that uses fully convolutional networks with auxiliary paths to achieve automatic segmentation of NPC on PET-CT images. This work is the first to segment NPC using dual-modality PET-CT images. This technique is identical to what is used in clinical practice and offers considerable convenience for subsequent radiotherapy. The deep supervision introduced by auxiliary paths can explicitly guide the training of lower layers, thus enabling these layers to learn more representative features and improve the discriminative capability of the model. Results of threefold cross-validation with a mean dice score of 87.47% demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. The method remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in NPC segmentation. We also validated by experiments that the registration process among different subjects and the auxiliary paths strategy are considerably useful techniques for learning discriminative features and improving segmentation performance.",Computer-Assisted Nuclear Atypia Scoring of Breast Cancer: a Preliminary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719586,Journal of digital imaging,2019 02 05,"Inter-pathologist agreement for nuclear atypia scoring of breast cancer is poor. To address this problem, previous studies suggested some criteria for describing the variations appearance of tumor cells relative to normal cells. However, these criteria were still assessed subjectively by pathologists. Previous studies used quantitative computer-extracted features for scoring. However, application of these tools is limited as further improvement in their accuracy is required. This study proposes COMPASS (COMputer-assisted analysis combined with Pathologist's ASSessment) for reproducible nuclear atypia scoring. COMPASS relies on both cytological criteria assessed subjectively by pathologists as well as computer-extracted textural features. Using machine learning, COMPASS combines these two sets of features and output nuclear atypia score. COMPASS's performance was evaluated using 300 images for which expert-consensus derived reference nuclear pleomorphism scores were available, and they were scanned by two scanners from different vendors. A personalized model was built for three pathologists who gave scores to six atypia-related criteria for each image. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used. COMPASS was trained and tested for each pathologist separately. Percentage agreement between COMPASS and the reference nuclear scores was 93.8%, 92.9%, and 93.1% for three pathologists. COMPASS's performance in nuclear grading was almost identical for both scanners, with Cohen's kappa ranging from 0.80 to 0.86 for different pathologists and different scanners. Independently, the images were also assessed by two experienced senior pathologists. Cohen's kappa of COMPASS was comparable to the Cohen's kappa for two senior pathologists (0.79 and 0.68).","Pharmacokinetics, Tissue Distribution and Excretion of Ag2S Quantum Dots in Mice and Rats: the Effects of Injection Dose, Particle Size and Surface Charge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719585,Pharmaceutical research,2019 02 26,"We systematically investigated the effects of injection dose, particle size and surface charge on the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion of Ag2S quantum dots (Qds) in rats and mice.",A case of minor salivary gland sialolithiasis of the upper lip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719584,Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 03 29,"Sialolithiasis is the most common disease of the salivary glands.

In the present study, we sequenced ALPL and a panel of collagen type I-related genes in 24 adults (age 22-80 years; 20 female) with persistently low serum ALP (< 40 U/L) and a range of rheumatologic symptoms. We found heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ALPL in 14 (58%) of these individuals. In addition, 7 study participants had potentially damaging heterozygous variants of uncertain significance in genes related to collagen type I. Patients who were positive for ALPL variants had similar age and serum ALP levels to patients in whom no ALPL variants were detected, but had higher serum pyridoxal-5-phosphate concentrations (median 214 nmol/L vs. 64 nmol/L; p = 0.02; U test). In summary, heterozygous ALPL variants are frequent in individuals with rheumatologic symptoms and low ALP serum activity.

There are only a few small series and case reports documenting malignant transformation of synovial chondromatosis into secondary chondrosarcoma, typically within the hip in the setting of recalcitrant disease and multiple recurrences. Chondrosarcoma arising in synovial chondromatosis of the spine is exceedingly rare, with only one previously published case report involving the craniocervical junction. We present a case of chondrosarcoma arising within synovial chondromatosis of the lumbosacral spine, with the diagnosis made at the time of initial presentation.

Mosquito vectors that belong to several genera such as Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex play a crucial role in the transmission of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and elephantiasis diseases worldwide. We tested the efficacy of two commercial-grade oviposition attractant formulations that were developed for the container-inhabiting Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes present in urban or semi-urban environments. These attractants can lure gravid females. Field trials were conducted in residential yards during a post-rainy season in September and October. Our data showed considerable efficacy for both attractants. Aedes-attractant collected 1.6-fold more larvae (101.2 ± 10.5 larvae/trap) than the control, and Culex-attractant collected 1.27-fold more larvae (151.2 ± 12.5 larvae/trap) than the control, resulting in 0.8 and 0.7 oviposition attraction indices (OAIs), respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the Aedes-attractant was more stable than the Culex-attractant. Location and time did not alter the efficacy of these attractants. Our experiment suggests that these attractants can be used for the development of species-specific gravid traps to detect, estimate, and control the mosquito population in urban and semi-urban areas.",Epidemiology of gastrointestinal nematodes of alpacas in Australia: I. A cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719533,Parasitology research,2019 04 16,"This study involved a national cross-sectional survey of gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) of alpacas in Australia. A total of 1545 fresh faecal samples were collected from both sexes of alpacas and processed for faecal egg counts (FEC) and molecular identification of nematodes using the multiplexed tandem PCR assay. Based on egg morphology, the overall prevalence of GINs was 66% while that for strongyles was 59%. The overall mean FEC was 276 eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces, with the highest count of 17,415 EPG. Male alpacas had a higher prevalence (68%, 334/490) as well as mean FEC (328 ± 60 EPG) of GINs than females (63%, 602/954; 227 ± 26, respectively). Weaners had the highest prevalence (80%) whereas tuis had the highest FEC (402 EPG) of nematodes. The highest prevalence (77%, 293/383) and FEC (630 EPG) of GINs were observed in the summer rainfall zone followed by the Mediterranean-type rainfall, non-seasonal rainfall and winter rainfall zones. The characterisation of nematode DNA isolated from faeces revealed the occurrence of seven different GINs, including Camelostrongylus mentulatus, Cooperia spp., Haemonchus spp., Oesophagostomum spp., Ostertagia ostertagi, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp. Besides, Nematodirus spp. and Trichuris spp. were also found during FECs. The prevalence of Haemonchus spp. was highest in the summer rainfall zone while that of C. mentulatus was highest in the Mediterranean-type rainfall, non-seasonal rainfall and winter rainfall zones. The findings of this study revealed that alpacas harbour many of the same nematodes as sheep and cattle.",Energetics and thermal adaptation in semifossorial pine-voles Microtus lusitanicus and Microtus duodecimcostatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719532,"Journal of comparative physiology. B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental physiology",2019 03 29,"Rodents colonising subterranean environments have developed several morphological, physiological and behaviour traits that promote the success of individuals in such demanding conditions. Resting metabolic rate, thermoregulation capacity and daily energy expenditure were analysed in two semi-fossorial pine-vole species Microtus lusitanicus and Microtus duodecimcostatus inhabiting distinct areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Individuals capture location varied in habitat and soil features, allowing the comparison of energetic parameters with ecological characteristics, that can help explain the use of the subterranean environment and dependence of the burrow system. Results showed that M. duodecimcostatus has lower mass independent resting metabolic rate when compared with M. lusitanicus, which may be a response to environmental features of their habitat, such as dryer soils and lower water availability. Thermal conductance increased with body mass and was dependent on the ambient temperature. No significant differences were observed in the daily energy expenditure, but water economy data demonstrated the influence of the water available in the habitat on the energetics of voles. These species may rely on behavioural adaptations and seasonal use of burrows to cope with thermal challenges of subterranean activity and soil constraints. We found strong evidence that M. lusitanicus is able to use torpor as a response to low ambient temperatures which is a new observation among Arvicolines."

Nosema ceranae and Nosema apis, are microsporidian parasites that are highly pathogenic to honey bees and have been implicated as a factor in honey bee losses. While traditional methods for quantifying Nosema infection have high sensitivity and specificity, there is no field-portable device for field measurements by beekeepers. Here we present a field-portable and cost-effective smartphone-based platform for detection and quantification of chitin-positive Nosema spores in honey bees. The handheld platform, weighing only 374 g, consists of a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, a custom-developed smartphone application, and an easy to perform sample preparation protocol. We tested the performance of the platform using samples at different parasite concentrations and compared the method with manual microscopic counts and qPCR quantification. We demonstrated that this device provides results that are comparable with other methods, having a limit of detection of 0.5 × 106 spores per bee. Thus, the assay can easily identify infected colonies and provide accurate quantification of infection levels requiring treatment of infection, suggesting that this method is potentially adaptable for diagnosis of Nosema infection in the field by beekeepers. Coupled with treatment recommendations, this protocol and smartphone-based optical platform could improve the diagnosis and treatment of nosemosis in bees and provide a powerful proof-of-principle for the use of such mobile diagnostics as useful analytical tools for beekeepers in resource-limited settings.",Cryptand-imidazolium supported total synthesis of the lasso peptide BI-32169 and its d-enantiomer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719511,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 15,"Lasso peptides are attracting increasing attention due to their broad range of biological activities. The knot topology of lasso peptides, which contains an isopeptide bond-bridged macrocycle threaded by its C-terminal tail, has been proven to be an important structural feature for their bioactivities.

Herein, a cryptand-imidazolium complex is designed as a multi-linker support and applied in the chemical synthesis of the lasso peptide BI-32169. Furthermore, the chiral switching of the support and the introduction of d-amino acids enable the synthesis of the d-enantiomer of BI-32169, which shows not only a strong glucagon receptor antagonist activity, but also a much higher enzymatic stability compared to the l-lasso peptide.",Ordered mesoporous silica cubic particles decorated with silver nanoparticles: a highly active and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719510,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 02 26,"In this work, using a modified Stöber process, we synthesized ordered mesoporous silica cubic particles (OMS-C) and prepared a nanocatalyst (Ag-OMS-C) based on OMS-C with a high surface area via an in situ auto-reduction strategy. The as-prepared Ag-OMS-C nanocomposites demonstrated open mesopores (3.51 nm), a large specific surface area (540 m2 g-1) and a high pore volume (0.88 cm3 g-1). The catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) over the Ag-OMS-C nanocatalyst was almost complete within 150 s without stirring and the rate constant k (30 × 10-3 s-1) is much higher than those of other substrate-supported Ag nanocatalysts. Moreover, the Ag-OMS-C nanocomposites hold a stable catalytic efficiency over five reaction cycles. The results indicate that the Ag-OMS-C nanocatalyst exhibited high catalytic activity and good reusability toward the reduction of 4-NP, which might be attributed to the large specific surface area, the pore structure of the nanocatalyst, as well as the synergistic effect between OMS-C and AgNPs.",A molecular engineering approach to pore-adjustable nanoporous carbons with narrow distribution for high-performance supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719509,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 25,"The space-confined twin-polymerization of molecule-engineered silane monomers was performed to induce narrow large-micropores and/or small-mesopores into the oxygen-doped nanoporous carbons, capable of simultaneously achieving large specific capacitance and high rate capability for supercapacitors.",Cancer stem cell mobilization and therapeutic targeting of the 5T4 oncofetal antigen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719508,Therapeutic advances in vaccines and immunotherapy,2019 02 07,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) can act as the cellular drivers of tumors harnessing stem cell properties that contribute to tumorigenesis either as founder elements or by the gain of stem cell traits by the malignant cells. Thus, CSCs can self-renew and generate the cellular heterogeneity of tumors including a hierarchical organization similar to the normal tissue. While the principle tumor growth contribution is often from the non-CSC components, it is the ability of small numbers of CSCs to avoid the effects of therapeutic strategies that can contribute to recurrence after treatment. However, identifying and characterizing CSCs for therapeutic targeting is made more challenging by their cellular potency being influenced by a particular tissue niche or by the capacity of more committed cells to regain stem cell functions. This review discusses the properties of CSCs including the limitations of the available cell surface markers, the assays that document tumor initiation and clonogenicity, the roles of epithelial mesenchymal transition and molecular pathways such as Notch, Wnt, Hippo and Hedgehog. The ability to target and eliminate CSCs is thought to be critical in the search for curative cancer treatments. The oncofetal tumor-associated antigen 5T4 (TBGP) has been linked with CSC properties in several different malignancies. 5T4 has functional attributes that are relevant to the spread of tumors including through EMT, CXCR4/CXCL12, Wnt, and Hippo pathways which may all contribute through the mobilization of CSCs. There are several different immunotherapies targeting 5T4 in development including antibody-drug conjugates, antibody-targeted bacterial super-antigens, a Modified Vaccinia Ankara-basedvaccine and 5T4-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. These immune therapies would have the advantage of targeting both the bulk tumor as well as mobilized CSC populations.",Vestibular Characteristics of Patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719507,OTO open,2019 02 07,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease entity with symptoms that may extend beyond the sinonasal tract.

We analyzed a prospective database of 3078 patients who underwent VNG at our institution over an 8-year period, which included 70 subjects who had a diagnosis of CRS assigned by an otolaryngologist. Overall, the VNG findings for patients with CRS were similar to those of the general population, with 50% exhibiting normal vestibular function. Peripheral lesions were the most common abnormal VNG finding, with a wide range of subjective symptom descriptions. This preliminary report of the prevalence of objective vestibular findings in patients with CRS may form the basis for future study.","Augmented Reality, Surgical Navigation, and 3D Printing for Transcanal Endoscopic Approach to the Petrous Apex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719506,OTO open,2019 02 07,"Otolaryngologists increasingly use patient-specific 3-dimensional (3D)-printed anatomic physical models for preoperative planning.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging was manually segmented to generate 3D models. AR facilitated virtual surgical planning. Navigation was then coupled to 3D-printed anatomy to simulate surgery using an endoscopic approach. Intraoperative findings were comparable to simulation. Virtual and physical models adequately addressed details of endoscopic surgery, including avoidance of critical structures.

The resulting data provide a rich encyclopedia of small-molecule RNA recognition patterns, defining chemotypes and RNA motifs that confer selective, avid binding. The resulting interaction maps were mined against the entire viral genome of hepatitis C virus (HCV).

A null hypothesis of no difference in tensile bond strength between groups of zirconia and lithium disilicate cemented with resin cements was also tested. Zirconia rods (n = 100) were randomly assigned to two different surface treatment groups; air borne particle abrasion and hot etching by potassium hydrogen difluoride (KHF2). Lithium disilicate rods (n = 50) were surface etched by hydrofluoric acid (HF). Five different dual cure resin cements were used for cementing rods to bovine dentin. Ten rods of each test group were cemented with each cement. Test specimens were thermocycled before tensile bond strength testing. Fracture morphology was visualized by light microscope. Mean surface roughness (Sa value) was calculated for randomly selected rods. Cohesive fracture in cement was the most frequent observed fracture morphology. Combination of adhesive and cohesive fractures were second most common. Fracture characterized as an adhesive between rod and cement was not observed for KHF2 etched zirconia. Highest mean tensile bond strength was observed when cementing air borne particle abraded zirconia with Variolink Esthetic (Ivoclar Vivadent). All surface treatments resulted in Sa values that were significant different from each other. The number of cohesive cement fractures observed suggested that the cement was the weakest link in bonding of zirconia and lithium disilicate.,Detecting Self-Neglect: A Comparative Study of Indicators and Risk Factors in a Spanish Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719489,Gerontology & geriatric medicine,2019 02 07,"Objective: To provide information relevant for detecting potential self-neglecting elders in a Spanish population.

Methods & clinical development,2019 02 07,"While anti-angiogenic therapies for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are effective for many patients, they require multiple injections and are expensive and prone to complications. Gene therapy could be an elegant solution for this problem by providing a long-term source of anti-angiogenic proteins after a single administration. Another potential issue with current therapeutic proteins containing a fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain (such as whole antibodies like bevacizumab) is the induction of an unwanted immune response. In wet AMD, a low level of inflammation is already present, so to avoid exacerbation of disease by the therapeutic protein, we propose single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies, which lack the Fc domain, as a safer alternative. To investigate the feasibility of this, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-blocking antibodies in two formats were produced and tested in vitro and in vivo. The scFv transgene was then cloned into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. A therapeutic effect in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was demonstrated with antibodies in both scFv and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) formats (p < 0.04). Importantly, the scFv anti-VEGF antibody expressed from an AAV vector also had a significant beneficial effect (p = 0.02), providing valuable preclinical data for future translation to the clinic.",Trans-ocular Electric Current In Vivo Enhances AAV-Mediated Retinal Gene Transduction after Intravitreal Vector Administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719486,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2019 02 07,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery is a promising approach for therapy, but implementation in the eye currently is hampered by the need for delivering the vector underneath the retina, using surgical application into the subretinal space. This limits the extent of the retina that is treated and may cause surgical injury. Vector delivery into the vitreous cavity would be preferable because it is surgically less invasive and would reach more of the retina. Unfortunately, most conventional, non-modified AAV vector serotypes penetrate the retina poorly from the vitreous; this limits efficient transduction and expression by target cells (retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors). We developed a method of applying a small and safe electric current across the intact eye in vivo for a brief period following intravitreal vector administration. This significantly improved AAV-mediated transduction of retinal cells in wild-type mice following intravitreal delivery, with gene expression in retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. The low-level current had no adverse effects on retinal structure and function. This method should be generally applicable for other AAV serotypes and may have broad application in both basic research and clinical studies.",In Vitro Macrophage Assay Predicts the In Vivo Anti-inflammatory Potential of Exosomes from Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719485,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2019 02 07,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play key roles in cell biology and may provide new clinical diagnostics and therapies. However, it has proven difficult to develop protocols for their purification and characterization. One of the major barriers in the field has been a lack of convenient assays for their bioactivity. Developing assays has not been a trivial matter, because of the heterogeneity of EVs, the multiple activities they demonstrate, and the uncertainty about their modes of action. Therefore, it is likely that multiple assays for their activities are needed. One important assay will be for the anti-inflammatory activity observed in mice after administration of the small EVs commonly referred to as exosomes. We developed an assay for the anti-inflammatory activity of exosomes with a line of mouse macrophages. The assay makes it possible to rank different preparations of exosomes by their anti-inflammatory activity, and their ranking predicts their efficacy in suppressing LPS-stimulated inflammation in mice. The assay is convenient for comparing multiple samples and, therefore, should be useful in developing protocols for the purification and characterization of anti-inflammatory exosomes.",Increased Prevalence of Concomitant Psychiatric Diagnoses Among Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroscopic Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719482,Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,2019 02 07,Active patients with musculoskeletal pain are not immune to psychological or psychiatric disease.

There is evidence that heart failure in experimental animals and humans is accompanied and possibly exacerbated by increased activity of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and/or 2A. Here, we wanted to study the age-dependent protein expression of major members of the protein phosphatase family in human hearts. Right atrial samples were obtained during bypass surgery. Patients (n=60) were suffering from chronic coronary artery disease (CCS 2-3; New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage 1-3). Age ranged from 48 to 84 years (median 69). All patients included in the study were given β-adrenoceptor blockers. Other medications included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or angiotensin-receptor-1 (AT1) inhibitors, statins, nitrates, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASS). 100 µg of right atrial homogenates was used for western blotting. Antibodies against catalytic subunits (and their major regulatory proteins) of all presently known cardiac serine/threonine phosphatases were used for antigen detection. In detail, we studied the expression of the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c); I1PP1 and I2PP1, proteins that can inhibit the activity of PP1c; the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac); regulatory A-subunit of PP2A (PP2AA); regulatory B56α-subunit of PP2A (PP2AB); I1PP2A and I2PP2A, inhibitory subunits of PP2A; catalytic and regulatory subunits of calcineurin: PP2BA and PP2BB; PP2C; PP5; and PP6.

There was a significant decline in PP2Ac and I2PP2A expression in older patients, whereas all other parameters remained unchanged with age. It remains to be elucidated whether the decrease in the protein expression of I2PP2A might elevate cardiac PP2A activity in a detrimental way or is overcome by a reduced protein expression and thus a reduced activity of PP2Ac.",The Crosstalk between Fat Homeostasis and Liver Regional Immunity in NAFLD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719457,Journal of immunology research,2019 04 22,"The liver is well known as the center of glucose and lipid metabolism in the human body. It also functions as an immune organ. Previous studies have suggested that liver nonparenchymal cells are crucial in the progression of NAFLD. In recent years, NAFLD's threat to human health has been becoming a global issue. And by far, there is no effective treatment for NAFLD. Liver nonparenchymal cells are stimulated by lipid antigens, adipokines, or other factors, and secreted immune factors can alter the expression of key proteins such as SREBP-1c, ChREBP, and PPARγ to regulate lipid metabolism, thus affecting the pathological process of NAFLD. Interestingly, some ncRNAs (including miRNAs and lncRNAs) participate in the pathological process of NAFLD by changing body fat homeostasis. And even some ncRNAs could regulate the activity of HSCs, thereby affecting the progression of inflammation and fibrosis in the course of NAFLD. In conclusion, immunotherapy could be an effective way to treat NAFLD.",Human Visceral Adipose Tissue Macrophages Are Not Adequately Defined by Standard Methods of Characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719456,Journal of diabetes research,2019 06 04,"Obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation both systemically and within specific tissues, including adipose tissue (AT). In murine models of obesity, there is a shift in the inflammatory profile of the AT immune cells, with an accumulation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages that surround the expanding adipocyte. However, much less is known about the immune cell composition and how to best define AT macrophages in humans. Objective. The goals of the current study were to determine the contribution of macrophages to the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in lean versus obese human visceral AT (VAT); examine the expression of common M1, M2, and pan macrophage markers; and determine the association of specific macrophage types with known biomarkers of obesity-related cardiometabolic disease. Research Design and Methods. VAT biopsies were obtained from obese (n = 50) and lean (n = 8) patients during elective surgery. Adipocytes and SVF were isolated, and the SVF was subjected to flow cytometry analyses. Results. Our results indicate that VAT macrophages are increased in obesity and associate with biomarkers of CVD but that many macrophages do not fall into currently defined M1/M2 classification system based on CD206 receptor expression levels. Conclusions. VAT macrophages are increased in obese subjects, but the current markers used to define macrophage populations are inadequate to distinguish differences in human obesity. Further studies are needed to delineate the function of AT macrophages in the maintenance and progression of human AT inflammation in obesity.",Effectiveness of the Chronic Care Model in Type 2 Diabetes Management in a Community Health Service Center in China: A Group Randomized Experimental Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719455,Journal of diabetes research,2019 06 04,"The Chronic Care Model, based on core elements of team-centered care in chronic diseases, has widely been accepted.

Here, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance- (1H NMR-) based metabolomic analysis was used to monitor the whole process of rat diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC. Intraperitoneal administration of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was used to induce primary HCCs in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed to follow the tumor formation and growth in the liver and H&E staining was used to confirm MR imaging findings. The rats with DEN treatment and control rats without DEN were euthanized at the time points of 3, 8, and 15 weeks after the start of modeling. 1H NMR-based metabolomic analysis was used to explore hepatic metabolite changes and certify key metabolic pathways in the process of tumor tumorigenesis. Our MRI results depicted the formation of HCC nodules in ten rats 14 weeks after DEN injection which were confirmed by histology. Twenty-four different metabolites were identified and quantified by 1H NMR spectroscopy; OPLS-DA models and corresponding VIP plots analysis further identified ten metabolites associated with the abnormal metabolism. The aberrant glucose, lipid, and glutathione-glutamine-glutamate metabolism could be detected involving in the process of hepatic tumorigenesis, which provides an important evidence for the in-depth study of subsequent molecular mechanisms, especially the glutathione-glutamine-glutamate metabolism.","Three-Dimensional Human Gait Pattern: Reference Data for Young, Active Women Walking with Low, Preferred, and High Speeds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719452,BioMed research international,2019 05 16,"Normal gait pattern is the key component in the investigation of pathological gait patterns. In computer motion analysis there is a need to include data from participants with different somatic structures to develop a normative database or to limit the database results to a specific population. The aim of this study was to determine kinematic gait patterns for young, active women walking with low, preferred, and self-selected speeds with regard to their somatic characteristics. Laboratory-based gait analysis was performed on 1320 gait cycles taken from 20 young, active women walking with three different speeds. Comprehensive anthropometric measurements and descriptive statistics were used to describe spatiotemporal and angular variables at each walking condition. The results demonstrated some significant differences in young, active women walking between different speeds and compared to the literature. This suggests that there is a need to include data from participants with different somatic structures to develop a normative database or limit the database results to a specific population. Detailed linear and angular kinematic variables allow for proper adjustment of parameters depending on the gait speed of people with locomotion disorders.",Aberrant Periodontal and Systemic Immune Response of Overweight Rodents to Periodontal Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719451,BioMed research international,2019 05 16,"This study aimed to explore periodontal and systemic immune response of overweight hosts to periodontitis. Forty C57 BL/6J male mice were divided into high (HF) or low fat (LF) diet groups and fed with the two diets, respectively, for 8 weeks. Each diet group was then divided into periodontitis (P) or control (C) groups (n = 10 per group) for 10-day ligation or sham-ligation. Overweight-related parameters including body weight were measured. Alveolar bone loss (ABL) was morphometrically analyzed and periodontal osteoclasts were stained. Periodontal immune response including leukocyte and macrophage number and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by histology and quantitative PCR. Serum cytokine and lipid levels were quantified using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and biochemistry. It was found that HF group had 14.4% body weight gain compared with LF group (P < 0.01). ABL and periodontal osteoclast, leukocyte, and macrophage number were higher in P group than C group regardless of diet (P < 0.05). ABL and periodontal osteoclast number were not affected by diet regardless of ligation or sham-ligation. Leukocyte and macrophage number and protein level of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in periodontium and serum interleukin-6 level were downregulated by HF diet in periodontitis mice (P < 0.05). Periodontal protein level of TNF-α was highly correlated with serum interleukin-6 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P < 0.01). These findings indicated that impaired immune response occurs both periodontally and systemically in preobesity overweight individuals. Given a well-reported exacerbating effect of obesity on periodontitis, overweight, if let uncontrolled, might place the individuals at potential risk for future periodontal tissue damage.",A Comparison of the Effect of Sevoflurane and Propofol on Ventricular Repolarisation after Preoperative Cefuroxime Infusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719450,BioMed research international,2019 05 16,"The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in QT, QTc, and Tp-e intervals and Tp-e/QT ratio on surface electrocardiogram (ECG) signals during anaesthesia induction using propofol or sevoflurane after preoperative cefuroxime infusion. Some 120 cases of gynaecological patients are randomly divided into propofol (P) and sevoflurane (S) groups (n=60). After cefuroxime (1.5 g) was infused in the two groups of patients, propofol target controlled infusion (TCI) was conducted in the P group for 5 min to realise a plasma concentration of 4 μg/ml while patients in the S group inhaled anaesthesia by infusing 1.3 MAC sevoflurane for 6 min. The 12-lead ECGs were separately collected before infusing cefuroxime (T1), after infusing cefuroxime (T2), and after infusing propofol or sevoflurane (T3) to measure QT and Tp-e intervals, calculate QTc and Tp-e/QT, and record MAP and HR. Finally, we demonstrated that QT, QTc, and Tp-e intervals and Tp-e/QT ratio had no change (P > 0.05) after cefuroxime infusion in the two groups of patients compared with that before infusing antibiotics. Moreover, after conducting preoperative cefuroxime infusion, using propofol and sevoflurane had no influence on Tp-e interval, but sevoflurane can significantly prolong QT and QTc intervals (P < 0.05).",The Ovotransferrin-Derived Peptide IRW Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammatory Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719449,BioMed research international,2019 05 16,"IRW (Ile-Arg-Trp), a bioactive peptide isolated from egg ovotransferrin, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the effects of IRW on inflammatory cytokines and microbiota were explored in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat model of inflammatory peritonitis. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with LPS to establish peritonitis. HUVECs were exposed to IRW for 12 h before introducing LPS. Notably, IRW exerted beneficial effects against LPS-induced peritonitis, specifically, by reducing the serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (P<0.05). A faecal microbiota analysis revealed that IRW significantly increased the Shannon and decreased the Simpson indices (P<0.05). Furthermore, IRW treatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced enhancement of TNF-α, IL-8, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in HUVECs (P<0.05). In conclusion, IRW supplementation inhibited the inflammatory mediator synthesis and LPS-induced inflammatory responses and influenced the gut microbiota.",Gut Microbiota-Derived Mediators as Potential Markers in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719448,BioMed research international,2019 05 16,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common, multifactorial, and poorly understood liver disease whose incidence is globally rising. During the past decade, several lines of evidence suggest that dysbiosis of intestinal microbiome represents an important factor contributing to NAFLD occurrence and its progression into NASH. The mechanisms that associate dysbiosis with NAFLD include changes in microbiota-derived mediators, deregulation of the gut endothelial barrier, translocation of mediators of dysbiosis, and hepatic inflammation. Changes in short chain fatty acids, bile acids, bacterial components, choline, and ethanol are the result of altered intestinal microbiota. We perform a narrative review of the previously published evidence and discuss the use of gut microbiota-derived mediators as potential markers in NAFLD."

Free-ranging red deer are known to be the maintenance host of Mycobacterium (M.) caprae in certain areas in Austria, where cattle can become infected on alpine pastures shared with deer. The epidemiology of TB in deer in alpine regions is still poorly understood. To inform decisions on efficient interventions against TB in deer, a method is needed to better capture the infection dynamics on population level. A total of 4,521 free-ranging red deer from Austria's most western Federal state Vorarlberg were TB-tested between 2009 and 2018. M. caprae was confirmed in samples from 257 animals. Based on descriptions of TB-like lesions, TB positive animals were categorized with a newly developed lesion score called ""Patho Score."" Analyses using this Patho Score allowed us to distinguish between endemic, epidemic and sporadic TB situations and revealed different roles of subgroups of infected deer in infection dynamics. Overall, deer in poor condition, deer of older age and stags were the subgroups that were significantly more often TB positive (p = 0.02 or smaller for all subgroups). Deer in poor condition (p < 0.001) and stags (p = 0.04) also showed more often advanced lesions, indicating their role in mycobacterial spread. TB was never detected in fawns, while hinds were the subgroup that showed the fewest advanced lesions. Analysis of outbreaks of TB and lesion development in yearlings provided some evidence for the role of winter feeding as a source for increased infection transmission. Sporadic cases in TB-free areas appear to precede outbreaks in these areas. These currently TB-free areas should receive particular attention in sampling schemes to be able to detect early spreading of the infection. The Patho Score is a quick, easy-to-apply and reproducible tool that provides new insights on the epidemiology of TB in deer at population level and is flexible enough to relate heterogeneous wildlife monitoring data collected following different sampling plans. This lesion score was used for systematic assessment of infection dynamics of mycobacterial infections.","Ultrasound-Guided Synovial Biopsies of Wrists, Metacarpophalangeal, Metatarsophalangeal, Interphalangeal Joints, and Tendon Sheaths.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719434,Frontiers in medicine,2019 02 07,"Ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy (UGSB) is a minimally-invasive procedure which allows quality synovial tissue retrieval.

Specifically, it will define the mechanical properties of the newly formed bone-implant interface. 3D imaging during mechanical loading tests (in situ loading) can improve the understanding of the local processes leading to bone damage and failure. In this study, titanium screws were implanted into rat tibiae and were allowed to integrate for 4 weeks with or without the addition of the growth factor Bone Morphogenetic Protein and the bisphosphonate Zoledronic Acid. Samples were subjected to in situ pullout using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray tomography at the Tomcat beamline (SLS, PSI, Switzerland) at 30 keV with 25 ms exposure time, resulting in a total acquisition time of 45 s per scan, with a 3.6 μm isotropic voxel size. Using a custom-made loading device positioned inside the beamline, screws were pulled out with 0.05 mm increment, acquiring multiple scans until rupture of the sample. The in situ loading protocol was adapted to ensure short imaging time, which enabled multiple samples to be tested with short loading steps, while keeping the total testing time low and reducing dose deposition. Higher trabecular bone content was quantified in the surrounding of the screw in the treated groups, which correlated with increased mechanical strength and stiffness. Differences in screw implantation, such as contact between threads and cortex as well as minor tilt of the screw were also correlated to the mechanical parameters. In situ loading enabled the investigation of crack propagation during the pullout, highlighting the mechanical behavior of the interface. Three typical crack types were observed: (1) rupture at the interface of trabecular and cortical bone tissues, close to the screw, (2) large crack inside the cortex connected to the implant, and (3) first failure away from the screw with cracks propagating toward the screw-bone interface. Mechanical properties of in vivo integrated bone-metal screws rely on a combination of multiple parameters that are difficult to identify and separate one from the other.","Robotic Approach to Creation of Continent Catheterisable Channels-Technical Steps, Current Status, and Review of Outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719432,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 02 07,"Purpose: To report the current status of Robotic approach to creation of Catheterisable channel (CC) with the author's personal experience compared to published literature on technical steps, follow up, and outcomes. Methods: CC data was extracted from the prospective database set up for all Robotic pediatric urology procedures performed by the author at his institution. A literature search was then performed to look at the evidence base. Results: Eighteen consecutive cases (8M:7F) of Robotic approach to creation of CC was identified and included. All attempted cases were successfully completed without any conversion to open approach. Median age at surgery was 10.75 years (IQR 6.9-16.5); Median OT 197 min (IQR 131-295) with concomitant procedures in 4 cases. Appendix was used in 14 cases as CC conduit and distal ureter in 4 cases. Median Length of stay (LOS) was 2.75 days (IQR 2-6) and Median FU 27.3 m. Whilst FU duration is comparable to published series, average OT and LOS was much lower in this series. The LOS in this robotic series is much lower than the author's experience with open approach (2.75 vs. 5.8 days). No major complications postoperatively except for one exit site wound infection managed conservatively. None of the CC have been revised in this series and all channels are patent with 12 F or 14 F admissible catheter size. There were no cases of incontinence related to technique of creation of CC and no incidence of exit site stomal stenosis with use of ACE stopper until channel matures and Clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) is established. Conclusion: Robotic approach to CC is feasible, safe with excellent outcomes and minimum morbidity.

While most research has focused on adults, the illness also presents in children and adolescents. Many physicians find it difficult to diagnose the illness. In this commentary paper, we discuss a range of salient themes that have emerged from our ongoing research into the prevalence of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. We discuss reasons why pediatric prevalence estimates vary widely in the literature, from almost 0% to as high as 3%. We argue that there is considerable misdiagnosis of pediatric cases and over-inflation of estimates of pediatric ME/CFS. Many children and teenagers with general fatigue and other medical complaints may meet loose diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS.

Notably, a number of studies suggest that FMT success is dependent on the microbial diversity and composition of the stool donor, leading to the proposition of the existence of FMT super-donors. The identification and subsequent characterization of super-donor gut microbiomes will inevitably advance our understanding of the microbial component of chronic diseases and allow for more targeted bacteriotherapy approaches in the future. Here, we review the evidence for super-donors in FMT and explore the concept of keystone species as predictors of FMT success. Possible effects of host-genetics and diet on FMT engraftment and maintenance are also considered. Finally, we discuss the potential long-term applicability of FMT for chronic disease and highlight how super-donors could provide the basis for dysbiosis-matched FMTs."

We sought to identify demographic, health-related, and attitudinal factors that are most predictive of continued breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening decisions in older adults under various scenarios. A sample of adults age 65+ (n = 1272) were recruited from a nationally representative panel in November 2016, of which 881 (69.3%) completed our survey. Participants were presented vignettes in which we experimentally varied a hypothetical patient's life expectancy, age, quality of life, and physician screening recommendation. The dependent variable was the choice to continue cancer screening in the vignette. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify characteristics most predictive of screening decisions; both the participants' characteristics and the hypothetical patient's characteristics in the vignettes were included in the analysis. CART analysis uses recursive partitioning to create a classification tree in which variables predictive of the outcome are included as hierarchical tree nodes. We used automated ten-fold cross-validation to select the tree with lowest misclassification and highest predictive accuracy. Participants' attitude towards cancer screening was most predictive of choosing screening. Among those who agreed with the statement ""I plan to get screened for cancer for as long as I live"" (n = 300, 31.9%), 73.2% chose screening and 57.2% would still choose screening if hypothetical patient had 1-year life expectancy.

Experimental observations identified trans-(iPrPNP)CoH2(BPin) as the resting state in the borylation of five-membered heteroarenes, and 4-BPin-(iPrPNP)Co(N2)BPin as the resting state in the catalytic borylation of arene substrates. The active species, 4-R-(iPrPNP)CoBPin (R=H, BPin), were generated by reductive elimination of H2 in the former, through Berry pseudorotation to the cis isomer, and N2 loss in the latter. The catalytic mechanism of the resulting Co(I) complex was computed to involve three main steps: C-H oxidative addition of the aromatic substrate (C6H6), reductive elimination of PhBPin, and regeneration of the active complex. The oxidative addition product formed through the most favorable pathway, where the breaking C-H bond of C6H6 is parallel to a line between the two phosphine atoms, leaves the complex with a distorted PNP ligand, which rearranges to a more stable complex via dissociation and re-association of HBPin. Alternative pathways, σ-bond metathesis and the oxidative addition in which the breaking C-H bond is parallel to the Co-B bond, are predicted to be unlikely for this Co(I) complex. The thermodynamically favorable formation of the product PhBPin via reductive elimination drives the reaction forward. The active species regenerates through the oxidative addition of B2Pin2 and reductive elimination of HBPin. In the overall reaction, the flipping (refolding) of the five-membered phosphine rings, which connects the species with two phosphine rings folded in the same direction and that with them folded in different directions, is found to play an important role in the catalytic process, as it relieves steric crowding within the PNP ligand and opens Co coordination space. Metal-ligand cooperation based on the ligand's aromatization/dearomatization, a common mechanism for heavy-metal pincer complexes, and the dissociation of one phosphine ligand, do not apply in this system. This study provides guidance for understanding important features of pincer ligands with first-transition-row metals that differ from those in heavier metal complexes.",Effect of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block With Bupivacaine on Postoperative Pain in Patients Undergoing Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719401,"Allergy & rhinology (Providence, R.I.)",2019 02 07,"Postoperative pain is one of the most complications in endoscopic sinus surgery.

Capecitabine, which has served in clinical practice at least for 10 years, is a first-line antidigestive tract cancer drug for its better efficacy, patient compliance, and lower side effects. An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed and completely validated for simultaneous determination of capecitabine and its five metabolites in human plasma from colorectal cancer patients after administration of capecitabine tablet. One-step liquid-liquid extraction was successfully applied using ethyl acetate and isopropanol (19 : 1, V : V) for sample pretreatment. Chromatographic separation was achieved within 5 min based on an Atlantis T3-C18 column (3.0 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm) with gradient elution using mobile phases consisting of 0.0075% formic acid in water (pH 4) and in acetonitrile, and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min.

Moreover, the coagulation time of rabbit determined by test tubes has been adopted to study the effect imposed by the content of alkaloids on the anticoagulating activity of URCU. In addition, the software of Minitab was also utilized to fit the correlation between the content of alkaloids and the anticoagulating activity of URCU. The results obtained demonstrated that anticoagulant activities were available in both rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, among which the latter was the stronger one, while procoagulant activity was shown in corynoxeine. The case study can provide a useful reference for the research on drying other Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and further study on URCU.","Simultaneous Recognition of Species, Quality Grades, and Multivariate Calibration of Antioxidant Activities for 12 Famous Green Teas Using Mid- and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Coupled with Chemometrics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719372,Journal of analytical methods in chemistry,2019 02 07,"In this paper, mid- and near-infrared spectroscopy fingerprints were combined to simultaneously discriminate 12 famous green teas and quantitatively characterize their antioxidant activities using chemometrics. A supervised pattern recognition method based on partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was adopted to classify the 12 famous green teas with different species and quality grades, and then optimized sample-weighted least-squares support vector machine (OSWLS-SVM) based on particle swarm optimization was employed to investigate the quantitative relationship between their antioxidant activities and the spectral fingerprints. As a result, 12 famous green teas can be discriminated with a recognition rate of 100% by MIR or NIR data. However, compared with individual instrumental data, data fusion was more adequate for modeling the antioxidant activities of samples with RMSEP of 0.0065. Finally, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and validated by some statistical parameters and the elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) test. The results indicate that fusion of mid- and near-infrared spectroscopy suggests a new avenue to discriminate the species and grades of green teas. Moreover, the proposed method also implies other promising applications with more accurate multivariate calibration of antioxidant activities."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of a genetic polymorphism of carnosinase (CNDP1-D18S880 and -rs2346061), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3-rs1799983), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD-rs4880) genes with the development of diabetic nephropathy among Malaysian type 2 diabetic patients. A case-control association study was performed using 652 T2DM patients comprising 227 Malays (without nephropathy = 96 and nephropathy = 131), 203 Chinese (without nephropathy = 95 and nephropathy = 108), and 222 Indians (without nephropathy = 136 and nephropathy = 86). DNA sequencing was performed for the D18S880 of CNDP1, while the rest were tested using DNA Sequenom MassARRAY to identify the polymorphisms. DNA was extracted from the secondary blood samples taken from the T2DM patients. The alleles and genotypes were tested using four genetic models, and the best mode of inheritance was chosen based on the least p value. The rs2346061 of CNDP1 was significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy among the Indians only with OR = 1.94 and 95% CI = (1.76-3.20) and fitted best the multiplicative model, while D18S880 was associated among all the three major races with the Malays having the strongest association with OR = 2.46 and 95% CI = (1.48-4.10), Chinese with OR = 2.26 and 95% CI = (1.34-3.83), and Indians with OR = 1.77 and 95% CI = (1.18-2.65) in the genotypic multiplicative model. The best mode of inheritance for both MnSOD and NOS3 was the additive model. For MnSOD-rs4880, the Chinese had OR = 2.8 and 95% CI = (0.53-14.94), Indians had OR = 2.4 and 95% CI = (0.69-2.84), and Malays had OR = 2.16 and 95% CI = (0.54-8.65), while for NOS3-rs1799983, the Indians had the highest risk with OR = 3.16 and 95% CI = (0.52-17.56), followed by the Chinese with OR = 3.55 and 95% CI = (0.36-35.03) and the Malays with OR = 2.89 and 95% CI = (0.29-28.32). The four oxidative stress-related polymorphisms have significant effects on the development of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes patients. The genes may, therefore, be considered as risk factors for Malaysian subjects who are predisposed to T2DM nephropathy.","Maternal Perceptions of Self-Weight and Child Weight May Influence Milk Choice of Participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719345,Journal of obesity,2019 02 07,To examine the association between maternal perceptions of self-weight and child weight status and milk consumption behavior of Hispanic WIC participants.,Comparison between LigaSure™ and Harmonic® in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Single-Center Experience on 422 Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719344,Journal of obesity,2019 02 07,"New laparoscopic devices, such as electrothermal bipolar-activated devices (LigaSure™ (LS)) or ultrasonic systems (Harmonic® scalpel (HS)), have been applied recently to bariatric surgery allowing to reduce blood loss and surgical risks.

For T2DM patients, the main surgical intervention for CAD is autologous saphenous vein grafting. However, T2DM patients have increased risk of saphenous vein graft failure (SVGF). While the mechanisms underlying increased risk of vascular disease in T2DM are not fully understood, hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinaemia have been shown to contribute to microvascular damage, whereas clinical trials have reported limited effects of intensive glycaemic control in the management of macrovascular complications. This suggests that factors other than glucose exposure may be responsible for the macrovascular complications observed in T2DM. SVGF is characterised by neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) arising from endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and uncontrolled migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This is driven in part by proinflammatory cytokines released from the activated ECs and SMCs, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 stimulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT) pathway is a key mechanism through which EC inflammation, SMC migration, and proliferation are controlled and whose activation might therefore be enhanced in patients with T2DM. In this review, we investigate how proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, contribute to vascular damage resulting in SVGF and how suppression of proinflammatory cytokine responses via targeting the JAK/STAT pathway could be exploited as a potential therapeutic strategy. These include the targeting of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS3), which appears to play a key role in suppressing unwanted vascular inflammation, SMC migration, and proliferation.",Serum Nickel and Titanium Levels after Transcatheter Closure of Atrial Septal Defects with Amplatzer Septal Occluder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719342,Cardiology research and practice,2019 02 07,There is a concern about release of nickel and titanium after implantation of nitinol-containing devices.,Low-Dose Ibutilide Combined with Catheter Ablation of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: Procedural Impact and Clinical Outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719341,Cardiology research and practice,2019 02 07,"In patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), the procedural and clinical outcomes of ablation combined with infusion of antiarrhythmic drug are unknown.",Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Guided Only by Transesophageal Echocardiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719340,Cardiology research and practice,2019 02 07,To investigate a new method of left atrial appendage occlusion without fluoroscopy.,"Personality Traits, Clinical Characteristics, and Health-Related Quality of Life of Patients with Hypertension in a Primary Hospital in Ghana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719339,International journal of hypertension,2019 02 07,"Hypertension is a major health problem that remains a significant threat to the health and general wellbeing of many people all over the world.

We have recently demonstrated that Yptb can directly modulate naïve CD4+ T cell differentiation. However, whether fully differentiated forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), fundamental key players to maintain immune homeostasis, are targeted by Yptb remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that within the CD4+ T cell compartment Yptb preferentially targets Tregs and injects Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) in a process that depends on the type III secretion system and invasins. Remarkably, Yop-translocation into ex vivo isolated Foxp3+ Tregs resulted in a substantial downregulation of Foxp3 expression and a decreased capacity to express the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Together, these findings highlight that invasins are critically required to mediate Yptb attachment to Foxp3+ Tregs, which allows efficient Yop-translocation and finally enables the modulation of the Foxp3+ Tregs' suppressive phenotype.",Three laws for paperlessness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30719323,Digital health,2019 02 07,"We are familiar with paper and rarely think much about it, except that in healthcare there seems to be too much of it, and it is slow, inefficient, and so old. In contrast, paperlessness promises the future and freedom from paper's obvious limitations. We need to think clearly how to ensure paperlessness really improves healthcare, hence three simple laws: 1. Keep in sight the goal of improving healthcare. Paperlessness must be first about improving clinical processes, supporting staff and patients, not about replacing paper with new 'solutions'. 2. Only implement evidence-based change. Pursue paperlessness only where there is scientific evidence it is better for the real task. Successful paperlessness depends on user centred design and on quality implementation. 3. Plan for cultural change and moving goal posts.

However, little is known about the modulatory influence of the inflamed nasal polyp epithelial cells on the phenotype of the T cells. The aim of the present study was to assess this interaction. Tissue and blood samples were collected from 16 patients undergoing paranasal sinus surgery. Polypoid tissue was cultured under air-liquid interface conditions. Subsequently, cluster of differentiation (CD)3/CD28 activated peripheral lymphocytes from the same patients were added. After 3 days lymphocytes were separated from co-culture and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Additionally, cytokine expression of the polyp tissue was measured using a human T helper cell (TH)1/TH2/TH17 antibody array. Viability staining of CD3+ lymphocytes detected fewer apoptotic cells under co-culture conditions compared with in mono-culture. There was a significantly higher frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the co-culture system than in PBMC culture alone. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR isotype was significantly downregulated on co-cultured CD3+ lymphocytes and CD3+CD4+ T cells compared with the mono-cultured counterparts. Conventional Forkhead box P3- memory CD4+ T cells and activated regulatory T cells increased in frequency, and resting regulatory T cells decreased in the co-culture. Cytokine analysis identified expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-6 receptor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-β and macrophage inflammatory protein-3 in the polyp tissue. In summary, the present study performed a comparison between peripheral lymphocytes cultured with and without nasal polyp tissue cells was performed. The downregulation of HLA and the differentiation of Treg and Tconv by nasal polypoid tissue on PBMCs was demonstrated. Interestingly, the in vivo downregulation of HLA-DR on CD3+ lymphocytes, as reported previously, was confirmed in vitro. The inhibitory effect of polypoid tissue on the activation of lymphocytes is a possible pathogenic mechanism underlying CRSwNP."
