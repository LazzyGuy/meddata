Although numerous studies have examined the functions of yeast and mold MFS transporters in terms of sugar affinity and metabolic regulation, no functional analyses of MFS sugar transporters in white rot fungi have been reported. This study identified an MFS sugar transporter gene (Pshxt1) of the white rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624 expressed in liquid culture containing low concentrations of nitrogen source. Homologous expression of Pshxt1 dramatically increased the rates of glucose, fructose, mannose, and xylose consumption. Galactose consumption increased slightly but significantly. These data suggest that Pshxt1 has broad affinity for monosaccharides. In contrast, a transformant homologously expressing Pshxt1 consumed glucose in preference to xylose in wood enzymatic-digestion liquor and liquid culture. Additionally, homologous expression of Pshxt1 improved mycelial growth, aerobic ethanol production, and simultaneous aerobic saccharification and fermentation efficiency, whereas secretion of the ligninolytic enzyme manganese peroxidase was clearly decreased in the presence of glucose by Pshxt1 expression. These results suggest that Pshxt1 is involved in the repression of ligninolytic enzyme activity via carbon catabolite repression at sufficiently high glucose concentrations for activation of primary metabolism.","Characterization of a novel salt-, xylose- and alkali-tolerant GH43 bifunctional β-xylosidase/α-l-arabinofuranosidase from the gut bacterial genome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109875,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019 05 21,"A GH43 bifunctional β-xylosidase encoding gene (XylRBM26) was cloned from Massilia sp.

When 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside was used as a substrate, the enzyme reached optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 50°C and remained stable at pH 5.0-10.0. Purified XylRBM26 presented good salt tolerance and retained 96.6% activity in 3.5 M NaCl and 77.9% initial activity even in 4.0 M NaCl. In addition, it exhibited high tolerance to xylose with Ki value of 500 mM. This study was the first to identify and characterize NaCl-tolerant β-xylosidase/α-l-arabinofuranosidase from the gut microbiota. The enzyme's salt, xylose, and alkali stability and resistance to various chemicals make it a potential biocatalyst for the saccharification of lignocellulose, the food industry, and industrial processes conducted in sea water."

While chemical synthesis of the C5-desoxy analogs bearing a phenolic hydroxyl group in the A-ring of the saframycins was assumed to be laborious based on semi-synthetic modifications, a chemo-enzymatic approach allowed for concise access to the analogs. The C5-desoxy analog 7 exhibited greater DNA alkylating ability with a wider tolerance for the sequence variations compared to cyanosafracin B. The C5-desoxy A-ring having a C8 phenolic hydroxyl group, and a C1 substituent in the vicinity of the C21 aminonitrile responsible for DNA alkylation, were demonstrated to play pivotal roles in the interaction between the THIQ alkaloids and DNA.","Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of indane derived GPR40 agoPAMs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109791,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2019 06 04,"GPR40 (FFAR1 or FFA1) is a G protein-coupled receptor, primarily expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells and intestinal enteroendocrine cells.

The patients completed OHIP-14 and UWQoL questionnaires once before and then at 3 months after the surgery. There was a significant improvement in mean cumulative scores for both questionnaires. With the exception of functional limitation, all OHIP domains showed significant improvement. Preoperatively, the worst scores were found in the psychological distress domain, followed by the social handicap, physical pain and physical disability domains. More than half of the subjects (56%) reported having suicidal thoughts. Amongst the individual UWQoL domains, appearance, chewing, anxiety (P <  0.01), recreation and mood (P <  0.05) showed improved scores. Appearance and chewing were the top ranked priority domains before and after surgery. No significant change was found in speech, taste, sleep, or breathing. Psychosocial factors were found to play a much bigger role than previously thought. The physical, psychological, and social factors were intricately related and dynamically interacted with each other.

By means of fractal theory and its application in complex networks, a network topology can be described as consisting of the superposition of basic units, called fractal-cells, which are made up of several components and their connections. Based on this fractal-cell structure, we find that a fractal-cell network has structural similarity with its primitive structure, and then develop a method to build a reliable topology which is generated from a primitive ring structure.

However, the exact frequency of this microscopic event and its prognostic impact for patients affected by adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the prevalence and the prognostic potential of lymphovascular invasion in head and neck AdCC. A literature search on PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and ProQuest databases was undertaken in January 2019. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The relative frequency of lymphovascular invasion and its possible association with other clinicopathological parameters were addressed. A total of 22 studies and 2117 patients were included in this study. The frequency of lymphovascular invasion ranged from 5.2% to 72.5%. Lymphovascular invasion was associated with an increased likelihood of lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.58; 95% CI 1.61-4.12; p = 0.0001) and death (OR = 3.09; 95% CI 1.82-5.26; p = 0.0001), solid/higher-grade AdCC were more likely to present lymphovascular invasion (OR = 5.51; 95% CI 1.87-16-21; p = 0.002) and patients with this microscopic finding had a significantly lower OS (HR = 8.30; 95% CI 1.68-40.91; p = 0.009) and DFS (HR = 3.76; 95% CI 1.13-12.53; p = 0.03).

Various QoL instruments have been developed/ validated for assessment of oral health-related QoL (OHRQoL) in patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSF). Selection of an adequate instrument is challenging in routine practice due to lack of information on psychometric quality of measurement instruments. This systematic review gives an extensive overview of quality of all the currently available measurement instruments for use in OSF patients. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL were searched for relevant literature until December 2018 and the information was extracted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of the identified studies was assessed per measurement property according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurements Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Four studies that met the inclusion criteria were included. Three generic and one disease-specific QoL instruments were identified. Information regarding important measurement properties was often incomplete. The evidence for the quality of measurement instruments was found to be variable, none of the instruments performed sufficient on all measurement properties. Based on the available information, OHRQoL-OSF appeared to have adequate COSMIN measurement properties. As recently published, newer QoL instruments have not yet been evaluated in an adequate manner for use in OSF.

One of the challenges for the universal acceptance of PBMT use in cancer patients is whether or not there is a potential for the light to stimulate the growth of residual malignant cells that evaded oncologic treatment, increasing the risk for tumor recurrences and development of a second primary tumor. Current science suggests promising effects of PBMT in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema and oral mucositis, among other cancer treatment toxicities. Nevertheless, this seems to be the first systematic review to analyze the safety of the use of PBMT for the management of cancer-related toxicities. Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Embase were searched electronically. A total of 27 articles met the search criteria. Selected studies included the use of PBMT for prevention and treatment of oral mucositis, lymphedema, radiodermatitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Most studies showed that no side effects were observed with the use of PBMT. The results of this systematic review, based on current literature, suggest that the use of PBMT in the prevention and management of cancer treatment toxicities does not lead to the development of tumor safety issues.",Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with nedaplatin versus cisplatin in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109691,Oral oncology,2019 05 21,"Nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy became an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",Metabolic tumor volume of metastatic lymph nodes and survival after total laryngectomy in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109690,Oral oncology,2019 05 21,"The prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in locally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer is established in the setting of chemoradiotherapy, while it remains unknown in the setting of upfront total laryngectomy."

In this review, we focused on three insights that have increased our understanding of the evolutionary history of this species, and that have implications for the study of evolutionary processes in other species as well. Because of technical limitations, most of the studies so far have focused on SNP variants. However, long-read sequencing techniques should allow us in the near future to include other type of genomic variants that also influence genome evolution.",Targeting female reproduction in insects with biorational insecticides for pest management: a critical review with suggestions for future research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109675,Current opinion in insect science,2019 05 21,"Of the different approaches to pest control, use of juvenile hormone analogs (e.g. methoprene), molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone) analogs (e.g. tebufenozide) and chitin synthesis inhibitors (e.g. diflubenzuron) has dominated this field. Since they adversely interfere with the normal growth and development in one way or another, they have been collectively called as 'insect growth regulators' or IGRs. A lesser known fact is that they all have deleterious effects on reproduction as well as act as ovicides. The raison d'être for this review is to summarize what we have learnt during the last 3-4 decades in the use of these IGRs, how they affect insect reproduction and how we can apply this knowledge to control pest insects. Finally, we present, information on the state of the art use of molecular technologies such as RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 applications for pest management targeting insect reproduction.",Peptides in insect oogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109674,Current opinion in insect science,2019 05 21,"The physiological control of reproduction in insects depends on a combination of environmental and internal cues. In the adult stage, insects become sexually mature and generate gametes. In females, the latter process is designated as oogenesis. Peptides are a versatile class of extracellular signalling molecules that regulate many processes, including oogenesis. At present, the best documented physiological control mechanism of insect oogenesis is the insulin-related peptide signalling pathway. It regulates different stages of the process and provides a functional link between nutritional status and reproduction. Several other peptides have been shown to exert gonadoregulatory activities, but in most cases their exact mode of action still has to be unravelled and their effects on oogenesis could be direct or indirect. Some regulatory peptides, such as the Drosophila sex peptide, are being transferred from the male to the female during the mating process.",Turning food into eggs: insights from nutritional biology and developmental physiology of Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109673,Current opinion in insect science,2019 05 21,"Nutrition plays a central role in fecundity, regulating the onset of reproductive maturity, egg production, and the survival and health of offspring from insects to humans. Although decades of research have worked to uncover how nutrition mediates these effects, it has proven difficult to disentangle the relative role of nutrients as the raw material for egg and offspring development versus their role in stimulating endocrine cascades necessary to drive development. This has been further complicated by the fact that both nutrients and the signalling cascades they regulate interact in complex ways to control fecundity. Separating the two effects becomes important when trying to understand how fecundity is regulated, and in devising strategies to offset the negative effects of nutrition on reproductive health. In this review, we use the extensive literature on egg development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to explore how the nutrients from food provide the building blocks and stimulate signalling cascades necessary for making an egg.",Juvenile hormone signaling in insect oogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109672,Current opinion in insect science,2019 05 21,"Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in insect reproduction, but its molecular mode of action only became clear within the last decade.

The finding for a critical role of ecdysis triggering hormone (ETH) in both molting and ooogenesis now also highlights the importance of an integrated view of development and reproduction. Furthermore, insights from non-model insects, especially so social Hymenoptera and termites, where JH function gradually becomes decoupled from reproduction and plays a role in division of labor, emphasize the need to consider life cycle and life history strategies when studying insect reproductive physiology.",Evolution of maternal control of axial patterning in insects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109671,Current opinion in insect science,2019 05 21,"Positional and cell fate cues provided maternally to eggs are important factors in the development of many animals.

Recently, significant progress has been made in revealing the molecular basis of some classical embryological experiments. In addition, observations of novel forms of maternal positional cues have been made. Finally, it has become increasingly clear that no maternal source of positional information acts alone without input and feedback from zygotic target genes to ensure precise and repeatable pattern formation in the early embryo. These advances will be discussed in the context of historical experiments, our current understanding of how positional cues can be generated, stored, and transmitted in insect ovaries and eggs, and how the nature of the cues can change in evolution.",miRNA functions in stem cells and their niches: lessons from the Drosophila ovary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109670,Current opinion in insect science,2019 05 21,"From the very beginning of the miRNA era, Drosophila has served as an excellent model for explanation of miRNA biogenesis.

In a number of species, owing to the availability of sequenced genomes, particular steps in host specialization and genes that control them, are being identified. Many cases of specialization involve the ability to detoxify some component of the host. Examples include Drosophila sechellia and the octanoic acid in Morinda citrifolia, alpha-amanitin in mycophagous drosophilids, and the alkaloids in cactophilic species. Owing to the known ecologies of many species for which genomes exist, the Drosophila model system provides an unprecedented opportunity to simultaneously examine the genes underlying HOST LOCATION, HOST ACCEPTANCE and HOST USE, the types of selection acting upon them and any coevolutionary interactions among the genes underlying these steps."

Osteoclasts play key roles in the osteolytic process. Currently there is a lack of clinically effective measures to prevent or treat peri-prosthetic osteolysis and thus identification of new agents that can inhibit the enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption is warranted. Through this study, we discovered that the specific and potent ERK1/2 inhibitor, Vx-11e, can protect against calvarial osteolysis caused by titanium (Ti) particles in vivo. Low doses of Vx-11e mildly reduced osteoclast resorption whilst no calvarial osteolysis was observed with high dose Vx-11e treatment. Histological examination showed fewer osteoclasts and reduced bone erosion in the Vx-11e treated groups. In vitro cellular analyses showed that Vx-11e inhibited osteoclast formation from BMM precursors in response to RANKL, as well as bone resorption by mature osteoclasts. Mechanistically, Vx-11e impaired RANKL-induced ERK1/2 signaling by inhibiting its kinase activity thereby blocking the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. Moreover, Vx-11e significantly reduced the expression of RANKL-mediated genes such as ACP5/TRAcP, CTR, MMP-9, CTSK. Collectively, our data provides evidence for the potential therapeutic use of Vx-11e for the treatment of osteolysis diseases caused by extremely actived osteoclastogenesis.",Comparative interactome analysis reveals distinct and overlapping properties of Raf family kinases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109650,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"The three mammalian Raf proteins (A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf) are key components of the MAPK pathway.

Here, we report the comparative interactomes of the three Raf kinases under serum-starved and EGF-stimulated conditions. We identified nearly 400 novel interacting proteins; some interacted with all three isoforms while others interacted exclusively with one or two. Comparing the interactomes of the three Raf kinases under different conditions revealed Raf proteins perform distinct functions through specific interactions. Our interactome data help define the differences between the three Raf kinases and may uncover new functions or regulatory mechanisms. Knowledge of Raf kinase protein-protein interactions will help us to investigate the function of specific pathways in the future.","Antibacterial evaluation and mode of action study of BIMQ, a novel bacterial cell division inhibitor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109649,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"The worldwide spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria is currently an extremely serious health risk and therefore to develop new antibiotics is an urgent need.

However, not all studies support this association. Our objective was to characterize the action of ATRA in mature adipocytes of mice by ablating RAR signaling through overexpression of a well-characterized dominant negative RARα mutant (RARdn) form specifically in adipocytes. Altered RAR signaling in adipocytes resulted in a significant decrease in ATRA levels in visceral and brown adipose tissues as well as liver tissue. This was linked to significant impairments in glucose clearance and elevated hepatic lipid accumulation for chow diet fed mice, indicating the development of metabolic disease, including hepatic steatosis. In addition, we found that adipose RARdn expression in mice fed a chow diet decreased thermogenesis. We conclude that altered RAR signaling and ATRA levels in adipocytes impacts glucose and lipid metabolism in mice.",microRNA-16-5p promotes 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation through regulating EPT1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109647,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"Adipogenesis is an organized process of cellular differentiation by which pre-adipocytes differentiate towards mature adipocytes. miR-16-5p has been reported to be involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and angiogenesis.

However, it is still largely unknown how CSCs respond to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress. Here, we show that the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are markedly lower in breast CSCs (BCSCs) than that in non-cancer stem cells (NCSCs). A transient exposure of breast cancer cells to sublethal doses of H2O2 resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the epithelium-specific antigen (ESA)+/CD44+/CD24- subpopulations, a known phenotype for BCSCs. Although BCSCs survived sublethal doses of H2O2 treatment, they lost the ability to form tumor spheres and failed to generate colonies as demonstrated by mammosphere-formation and clonogenic assays, respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that H2O2 treatment led to a marked increase of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity but only minimal apoptotic cell death in BCSCs. Furthermore, H2O2 triggers p53 activation and promotes p21 expression, indicating a role for the p53/p21 signaling pathway in oxidative stress-induced senescence in BCSCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the maintenance of a lower level of ROS is critical for CSCs to avoid oxidative stress and H2O2-induced BCSC loss of function is likely attributable to oxidative stress-triggered senescence induction, suggesting that ROS-generating drugs may have the therapeutic potential to eradicate drug-resistant CSCs via induction of premature senescence.",SP promotes cell proliferation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma through the NK1R/Hes1 axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109645,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 08,"Substance P (SP) plays an important role in several types of cancer promotion and progression by binding to its preferential neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R).

However, the correlation between the morphology of the microvilli and absorption capability of cells remains elusive. Herein, by combining atomic force microscopy with fluorescence microscopy, we explored the effects of starvation on the morphology of microvilli in HeLa cells at the single cell level. We found that there is an increasing signal of dextran absorption after starvation, and importantly, we observed a significant increase in the number of single microvillus and the lamella-shaped microvilli on the surface of HeLa cells. In addition, we also found reversible changes in the morphology of microvilli under starvation stress and after relief from starvation. These phenomena indicate that the morphology of the microvilli plays a crucial role in absorption capacity of HeLa cells.

Immunological mechanisms are believed to underpin the pathogenesis, and intense immunotherapy is frequently required. Disease is often severe and neuromuscular recovery may be poor. Recently there has been an impressive international research effort to understand and characterise this emerging condition, although much remains unknown. Significant advances in the field include the discovery of specific autoantibodies, increased understanding of the risk factors, clinical characteristics and treatment options owing to a wealth of observational studies, and the development of novel classification criteria. Herein we review the current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, histological features and serological profiles associated with this condition. Diagnostic approaches are discussed, including the role of muscle MRI and antibodies targeting 3‑hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and signal-recognition peptide (SRP), and a review of current treatment recommendations is provided."

Those who had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 were defined to be in glomerular function stage 1 (GF-1), those who had eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 were defined to be in GF-2, those who had eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were defined to be in GF-3A, those who had eGFR between 15 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 were defined to be in GF-3B/4. There were consistent increases in adjusted geometric means (AGM) for both blood and urine lead from GF-1 to GF-3A even though increases were not uniform from one GF stage to another. For the total population, AGMs for blood lead were 1.23, 1.78, 2.25, and 2.25 μg/dL for GF-1, GF-2, GF-3A, and GF-3B/4 respectively. AGMs for urine lead were 0.49, 0.61, 0.68, and 0.47 μg/L for GF-1, GF-2, GF-3A, and GF-3B/4 respectively. Thus, from GF-3A to GF-3B/4, AGMs for both blood and urine lead decreased. However, percent increases from GF-1 to GF-3A for urine lead were smaller than for blood lead and percent decreases from GF-3A to GF-3B/4 for urine lead were larger than for blood lead. Females had lower AGMs than males for both blood and urine lead. Also, smoker-nonsmoker differences for blood lead narrowed as kidney function deteriorated but smoker-nonsmoker differences for urine cadmium lead as kidney function deteriorated. Smokers had sharper increases in AGMs for blood and urine lead than nonsmokers from GF-1 to GF-3A but at GF-3B/4, this difference was reduced to 0.17 μg/dL.","Titanium dioxide nanoparticles induce endothelial cell apoptosis via cell membrane oxidative damage and p38, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB signaling pathways modulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109618,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2019 05 21,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used nanoparticles.

Furthermore, animal models are used to study interactions of trace elements. Most published methods require larger amounts (500-1000 μL) of serum to achieve a reliable determination of multiple trace elements. However, oftentimes, these amounts of serum cannot be dedicated to a single analysis and the amount available for TE-determination is much lower. Therefore, a published ICP-MS/MS method for trace element determination in serum was miniaturized, optimized and validated for the measurement of Mn, Fe, Cu Zn, I and Se in as little as 50 μL of human and murine serum and is presented in this work. For validation, recoveries of multiple LOTs and levels from commercially available human reference serum samples were determined, intra- and inter-day variations were assessed and limits of detection and quantification determined. It is shown, that the method is capable of giving accurate and reproducible results for all six elements within the relevant concentration ranges for samples from humans living in central Europe as well as from laboratory mice. As a highlight, the achieved limits of detection and quantification for Mn were found to be at 0.02 μg/L serum and 0.05 μg/L serum, respectively, while using an alkaline diluent for the parallel determination of iodine.",Alterations in membrane fluidity are involved in inhibition of GM-CSF-induced signaling in myeloid cells by zinc.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109615,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2019 05 21,"Zinc has a strong influence on the function of the immune system and is a driving factor for immune cell development. In this regard, studies revealed cell type specific effects of zinc. During zinc deficiency for example, development and activity of myeloid cells seems to be prioritized at the cost of cells from the lymphoid lineage. In T-cells, the altered proliferation was found to be due to zinc's effect on IL-2-induced signaling processes, but in contrast to lymphoid cells, effects of zinc homeostasis on growth-factor-induced signaling in myeloid cells have not been investigated yet. The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is one of the major factors inducing monopoiesis. Considering the structural similarities between the GM-CSF receptor and those of the IL-receptor family as well as a similar set of signaling molecules involved, an impact of zinc on the GM-CSF signaling seems to be likely. Therefore, the effect of zinc on GM-CSF-induced signaling molecules was investigated here, using U937 cells as a model myeloid cell line. GM-CSF stimulation significantly increased STAT5 phosphorylation which was prevented completely by pre-incubation with zinc and pyrithione. U937 cells showed a strong pre-activation regarding c-Raf, which was significantly decreased by zinc and pyrithione incubation, independently from GM-CSF stimulation. As current literature was not sufficient to explain the observed effects, we hypothesized an altered receptor-complex assembly. As membrane composition and plasticity, subsumed under the term of membrane fluidity, was found to affect receptor multimerization, the impact of zinc on membrane fluidity was considered as a completely novel approach. Indeed, addition of zinc also decreased GM-CSFR expression on the cell surface and most interestingly altered membrane fluidity. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the incubation with zinc causes an alteration of membrane fluidity that hinders efficient receptor assembly as well as phosphorylation of signal molecules and therefore signal transduction.",Placental levels of metals and associated factors in urban and sub-urban areas of Seville (Spain).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109614,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2019 05 21,"Environmental exposure to metals among women, revealed their adverse effects on pregnancy. The fetus is exposed to these toxic elements only via the placenta which are able to accumulate there or cross it, compromising the protective functions of this organ. Numerous studies have shown associations between the prenatal exposition to some metals and an impact on cognitive, motor and intellectual development of the child. Sixty two placental samples were taken at delivery to determine the mineral content (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, Zn) by ICP-OES. Among these metals, essential ones (B, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Zn) can have health beneficial effects at low levels however, in high concentration are potentially toxic. On the other hand, elements such as Al, Cd, Pb, are classified as toxic metals, no matter what its concentration is. The aim of this study is to find the potential relationships between these metals levels, newborn's parameters, pregnancy details and the epidemiologic information obtained using a questionnaire data from the participant pregnant women from Seville (Spain). The main maternal determinant of detectable placenta Cd levels was smoking during pregnancy. Other maternal factors that may affect placenta metal levels were gestational age (Al, B, Ba, and Pb) or dietary supplement (Fe). It has to be stressed that our results have to be interpreted with caution, because of the small study group and the low exposure levels, along with the lack of information on potential sources of exposure to these metals. The use of placenta samples obtained at delivery can be considered strength of this study since the concentration of some metals in placenta can indicate the extent of maternal exposure during gestation.",Systematic evaluation of exposure to trace elements and minerals in patients with chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109613,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2019 05 21,"Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) in areas in and around Sri Lanka's North Central Province has been identified as a major non-communicable disease due to its high prevalence and the burden on the public health system. Controversial evidence relating to the etiology and risk factors of CKDu has been reported. The most debated is the role of trace elements such as Cd and As in the pathogenesis of CKDu. Urine and hair samples collected from CKDu patients and healthy controls were measured for the concentration of different elements including Cd and As. To assess the possible environmental exposures, drinking water and rice samples collected from the affected areas as well as unaffected areas in the country were analyzed. Transmission electronic microscopic analysis of renal biopsies from CKDu patients was also performed. Analysis of drinking water and rice samples indicated that the levels of all minerals and trace elements analyzed including Cd and As were within the levels recommended by World Health Organization and Sri Lanka drinking water guidelines and did not suggest any form of contamination. Analysis of biological samples, including urine, hair and renal tissue, did not provide evidence to support Cd or As toxicity in CKDu patients. Overall, the observations of this integrated, comprehensive study, which included biological, environmental and pathological investigations, strongly support our previous reports on the absence of Cd and As toxicity in areas with high prevalence of CKDu. Further, these observations do not provide evidence on the involvement of Cd and As in pathogenesis of CKDu in Sri Lanka.",Trace mineral composition of human breast milk from Brazilian mothers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109612,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2019 05 21,"Human milk is a dynamic food and some important differences in composition can be found between the milk from preterm and terms infants.

Whereas arsenic is widely accepted to be involved in oxidative stress damage, little is known about arsenic-induced oxidative damage in relationship to contaminated drinking water as a source. The aim of this study was to determine the association between arsenic exposure through drinking water and oxidative stress status by measuring levels of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) as a biomarker of oxidative stress damage in a Myanmar population. A questionnaire-based survey and drinking water and urine sampling (n = 198) were performed to assess the association between arsenic exposure and urinary 8-OHdG concentration in the Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar. Urinary arsenic concentrations were significantly correlated with drinking water arsenic concentrations (Spearman's rho = 0.32, p < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that higher urinary arsenic concentrations were significantly associated with higher 8-OHdG concentrations (coefficient = 0.09, 95% confidence interval, 0.03 - 0.15; p =  0.002). The present study identified that exposure to arsenic through drinking water could induce an increase in the urinary 8-OHdG concentration, reflecting increased oxidative DNA damage. These findings provide evidence that may explain the role of arsenic-induced oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of arsenic-induced diseases including cancers.",Comparison of aqueous and enzymatic extraction combination with sequential filtration for the profiling of selected trace elements in medicinal plants from Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109598,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),2019 05 21,"This work presents results for the profiling of eight essential elements (Co, Cu, Ni, V, Mo, Mn, Zn and Cr) in aqueous and enzymatic extracts of eight anti-diabetic medicinal plants, used by Traditional Medicine Practitioners from Nyamira County, Kenya determined by ICP-MS. The plants used in the study were Solanum indicum, Plectranthus barbatus, Ultrica dioica, Bidens pilosa, Solanum mauense, Clerodendrum myricoides, Carissa edulis and Aloe vera. A sequential filtration procedure was applied to fractionate the elemental contents of the obtained aqueous extracts into molecular size fractions. The results indicate that the low molecular size species (<3 kDa) were predominant for Mo, Zn, Ni, Co, Mn and Cu, while the moderately large species (10 kDa-0.45 μm) of V were predominant in most of the medicinal plant extracts. In addition enzymatic extraction was compared to aqueous extraction to study the effect of the gastric and intestinal conditions on the release of selected elements from the plants. The amount of the elements extracted by the gastric phase enzymes was higher than the amount extracted by the intestinal phase enzymes. In general, the determined elemental amounts of enzymatic extractions were higher than those of corresponding water extractions for 70% of the elements studied.",Mutagenic players in ALL progression and their associated signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109597,Cancer genetics,2019 05 21,"An alarming increase in acute lymphoblastic leukemia among children and males has drawn attention of investigators to delve into the genetic causes of ALL and to discover new therapeutic strategies with better prognosis.

Particularly in hematological malignancies, PIP4K2A was already described as an essential protein for a malignant phenotype, although the clinical and biological impact of PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C proteins have not being explored in the same extent. In the present study, we investigated the impact on clinical outcomes and gene network of PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C mRNA transcripts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (2013) study. Our results indicate that PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C, but not PIP4K2B, mRNA levels were significantly reduced in AML patients assigned to the favorable risk group (p < 0.05) and low levels of PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C positively affect clinical outcomes of AML patients (p < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analyses indicate that the expression of PIP4K2 genes is associated with biological process such as signal transduction, metabolism of RNA and genomic instability related-gene sets. In summary, our study provides additional evidence of the involvement of members of the PIP4K2 family, in particular PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C, in AML.",Aberrant methylation status of SPG20 promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma: A potential tumor metastasis biomarker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109594,Cancer genetics,2019 05 21,The aim of this study is to analyze the methylation levels of SPG20 promotor region and explore the association between the methylation levels and clinical features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).,The benefits of a model of interval comprehensive assessments (MICA) in hereditary cancer Syndromes: Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) as an example.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109593,Cancer genetics,2019 05 21,"A high percentage of individuals at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes are unaware of their risk. This is especially detrimental in syndromes such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer due to a CDH1 germline mutation, for which lifesaving prevention is possible. Surveillance for diffuse gastric cancer in the syndrome is limited, hence the recommendation for prophylactic total gastrectomy for mutation carriers. Genetic counseling and testing is crucial in suspected families but initial contact could be limited, leading to the importance of an interval comprehensive review every 5-8 years to identify and screen additional high-risk individuals. Our contact with a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer family in Jordan in 2011 led to a number of family members receiving education and genetic counseling. Our model of interval comprehensive assessment (MICA) was constructed and implemented by conducting family information service, video call and emails to the high-risk individuals 7 years after initial contact. Using an updated family pedigree we reached out to an additional thirteen high-risk members in six different countries and provided them with genetic education, counseling, and testing.

We retrospectively evaluated results from 183 solid tumor samples that were received during a 24 month period for testing using the FusionSeq™ assay, an RNA-based Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel of 53 genes known to form fusions in solid tumors. Positive yield rate (actionable fusions) was evaluated for all samples tested, as a correlate for clinical utility. Twenty five fusions (actionable, variants of uncertain significance - VUS, and benign) were identified, of which 7 were classified as actionable gene fusions, resulting in an overall positive yield rate of ∼3.8% (7/183). Sixteen mostly novel fusions were classified and reported as VUSs. Five fusion events were classified as false positives, occurring due to mispriming or wild-type read through while 2 were classified as likely benign. Additionally 68% of fusions (17 of 25) detected in our study were present in prostate, colorectal, and gynecological cancers, suggesting that the frequency of fusions identified is dependent on specific tumor type. The high number of novel fusions identified highlights the potential for fusions in precision medicine.",Deciphering the complexities of MECOM rearrangement-driven chromosomal aberrations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109591,Cancer genetics,2019 05 21,"MECOM rearrangement is associated with rapid disease progression and poor prognosis in myeloid neoplasms. Previous studies were often based on 3q26.2 abnormalities without confirmation of MECOM status. The frequency of MECOM rearrangement and attribution of various chromosomal aberrations remain poorly characterized. This study presented 129 cases with confirmed MECOM rearrangement by karyotyping and multiple FISH methodologies. MECOM rearrangement arose through translocation (49.6%, n = 64), inversion (40.3%, n = 52), insertion (5.4%, n = 7) or unknown mechanism(s) (4.7%, n = 6). The classic inv(3)(q21q26.2) was dominant (n = 50) in inversion-driven MECOM rearrangement; and 3 of them also had double inv(3). For translocation-driven MECOM rearrangement, t(3;21) was most common (n = 15), followed by t(2;3) (n = 13), t(3;12) (n = 10), t(3;3) (n = 9), t(3;8) (n = 6), t(3;6) and t(3;17) (n = 4 each), t(1;3) and t(3;?) (n = 1 each). Cases with t(3;3)-, t(3;12)-, and insertion-driven MECOM rearrangement were prone to exhibit a complex karyotype, while cases with t(2;3)-, t(3;21)- and insertion-driven MECOM rearrangement were prone to have an ""unbalanced"" MECOM FISH signal pattern, likely caused by uncommon breakpoint(s) within the target of 5'MECOM probe. Therefore, atypical chromosomal aberrations and/or mechanisms are involved in MECOM rearrangement. Confirmation/exclusion of MECOM rearrangement is necessary in all cases with a 3q26.2 abnormality.

A methodology for developing an integrated sustainability indicator was also defined. Global warming and acidification were about 40 kgCO2eq/m3 and 0.7 molcH+eq/m3 and 90 kgCO2eq/m3 and 1.1 molcH+eq/m3 for wastewater treatment and use on land, respectively. The impact on human health for use on land was about 3.5 × 10-4 (DALY), six times higher than wastewater treatment but quite negligible when compared to the DALY associated with other diseases in the same area. Costs calculated for wastewater treatment ranged from about 18 €/m3 up to 35 €/m3, about ten times higher than those related to use on land. The integrated sustainability indicator that was developed indicated higher sustainability for use on land and the relevant influence of such finding with respect to the environmental consequences.","Arsenic, copper, and chromium from treated wood products in the U.S. disposal sector.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109576,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Construction and demolition (C&D) wood can be recycled as mulch for landscaping or cogeneration. Limitations to such recycling are dependent on metals concentrations in mulch (As, Cu, and Cr) from the inclusion of waterborne-preservative treated wood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the amount of waterborne-preservative treated wood (by wood volume and by mass of metal) that enters the C&D wood waste stream in the U.S. by utilizing a mass balance approach. A model was developed using wood treatment industry production statistics, estimated leaching rates of metal-based preservatives, and typical service lives of wood products. Outputs of the model indicate that the volumes of waterborne preservative treated wood disposed of may exceed 16 million m3 per year by 2030. The peak yearly metal mass disposed of corresponded to 18,400 metric tons for arsenic and 24,500 tons of chromium in 2013. Given the current trends in production, the mass of copper disposed of will increase to 20,900 tons by 2030. In order to meet regulatory guidelines regarding metals in recycled C&D wood, waterborne-preservative treated wood must be separated and removed. This separation mitigates environmental contamination from wood preservatives such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA).",New approach for the transformation of metallic waste into nanostructured Fe3O4 and SnO2-Fe3O4 heterostructure and their application in treatment of organic pollutant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109575,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Appropriate recycling of waste to reusable materials is much sought after in the scientific community to control the incessant rising pollution in environment due to insufficient management of waste materials. To address this issue, efforts were directed to obtain SnO2-Fe3O4 nanocomposites from scrap tin plated steel and the use of these composites for the degradation of organic pollutant. We have demonstrated a novel, efficient and facile hydrometallurgy approach for the extraction of iron from waste tin plated steel containers found in plenty in the common waste generated in society. The extracted iron has further been utilized for the preparation of SnO2:Fe3O4 nanocomposites with different compositions (SnO2:Fe3O4 ratio of 93.2:6.8, 85:15, 58:42 and 40:60) using hydrothermal route. The photocatalytic activities of nanocomposite were determined spectroscopically using Rhodamine-B (RhB) as a model dye. Our results indicate that among all the composites with SnO2 (85%):Fe3O4 (15%) exhibits the best photocatalytic efficiency under UV light whereas the composition of SnO2 (93.2%):Fe3O4 (6.28%) is the most efficient in visible light. The above visible light efficiency was supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies which suggest a small amount of pure Fe is present at the Sn sites in the nanocomposite, leading to the reduction in the band gap of the nanocomposite and resulting in absorption in the visible range. Thus, in the present study, we have shown a process of conversion of waste to nanomaterials and its utilization for treatment of organic pollutants.",Phosphorus speciation and bioavailability of sewage sludge derived biochar amended with CaO.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109574,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"In this study, biochar samples were prepared from the co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) and CaO to explore the transformation of P speciation in sample. The potential of these biochar as a fertilizer to promote the growth of the plant was also evaluated. The result indicated that CaO addition can greatly facilitate the conversion of non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) to apatite inorganic phosphorus (AP, mainly Ca3(PO4)2 and Ca3Mg3(PO4)4). The addition of 10% CaO in feedstock is sufficient to convert SS inherent P into more bioavailable AP. Under such a dosage, AP content in biochar increased by 21.2-33.6% in contrast to CaO free sample at pyrolysis temperature of 500-800 °C, and water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) content decreased to less than 1% of TP. The addition of CaO can also apparently reduce Zn, Mn leaching from biochar. Additionally, hydroponics assay showed that CaO amended SS biochar can promote the growth of rice seedling. The results of this study indicate that preparing CaO amended SS biochar is a technically feasible strategy to utilize P resource in SS.",Two-step pyrolysis of corncob for value-added chemicals and high-quality bio-oil: Effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109573,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Two-step pyrolysis (TSP) of corncob(CC) coupled with water and acid washing pretreatment was conducted to investigate the effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) on TSP by Py-GC/MS. TG-FTIR was used to analyze the pyrolysis characteristics of the samples. The results showed that the removal of AAEMs postponed the pyrolysis process and significantly influenced the distribution of the pyrolysis products. As the content of AAEMs decreased, the bio-oil yield increased and the biochar yield decreased. TSP of CC achieved high selectivities for phenols and ketones in the first step and for hydrocarbons in the second step. TSP of acid-washed corncob (ACC) achieved high selectivities for furans in the first step and for sugars in the second step. Additionally, some value-added chemicals such as furfural (11.54%, ACC), 4-vinylphenol (23.57%, CC) and levoglucosan (43.05%, ACC) were also enriched in TSP. Therefore, a promising polygeneration scheme of TSP for the efficient utilization of biomass was proposed.",Statistical correlations on the emissions of volatile odorous compounds from the transfer stage of municipal solid waste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109572,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Odor pollution from treatment facilities and municipal solid waste (MSW) has caused wide public concern. Odorous compounds released from these facilities possess complex composition. Therefore, identifying typical odorous compounds and using their release rates to estimate those of other compounds may simplify the monitoring and evaluation of odor pollution. This study investigates the correlations of the release data of odorous compounds from a statistical perspective. For 12 months, we conducted in site monitoring in an MSW transfer station once each month to obtain 96 emission samples, and over 100 odorous compounds were quantified for each sample. Oxygenated compounds had considerable high release rates throughout the period, and ethanol was the dominant compound. Ethanol, dimethyl disulfide and methyl mercaptan were the top key compounds that contributed to the odor activity value. Correlation analyses within and across the categories showed that only a few compounds in saturated hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds had strong correlations with release rate. The coefficient of correlation between ethylbenzene and 19 other compounds, which covered only 25% of all the identified compounds in this study, was >0.5. These results show that representative compounds cannot be used in the calculation of release rate during the transfer stage.","Mass production of hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets by carbonizing ""real-world"" mixed waste plastics toward excellent-performance supercapacitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109571,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Recently, sustainable development and serious energy crisis called for appropriate managements for the large number of municipal and industrial waste plastics as well as the development of low-cost, advanced materials for energy storage. However, the complexity of waste plastics significantly hampers the application of ever used methods, and little attention is paid to the utilization of waste plastics-derived carbon in energy storage. Herein, porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) was produced by catalytic carbonization of ""real-world"" mixed waste plastics on organically-modified montmorillonite (OMMT) and the subsequent KOH activation. PCNSs was featured on hierarchically micro-/mesoporous structures with the pore size distribution centered on 0.57, 1.42 and 3.63 nm and partially exfoliated graphitic layers, and showed a high specific surface area of 2198 m2 g-1 and a large pore volume of 3.026 cm3 g-1. Benefiting from these extraordinary properties, PCNSs displayed a superior performance for supercapacitors with high specific capacitances approaching 207 and 120 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. Importantly, when the current density increased to 10 A g-1, the specific capacitances remained at 150 F g-1 (72.5%) and 95 F g-1 (79.2%) in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. The outstanding rate capability of PCNSs was in sharp contrast to the performance of traditional activated carbons. This work not only provides a potential way to recycle mixed waste plastics, but also puts forward a facile sustainable approach for the large-scale production of PCNSs as a promising candidate for supercapacitors.",Odor removal by and microbial community in the enhanced landfill cover materials containing biochar-added sludge compost under different operating parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109570,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Odor problem has become a growing concern for municipal solid waste (MSW) operators and communities located close to landfill sites. In this study, nine laboratory-scale landfill reactors were used to simulate in-situ odor control by a novel landfill cover material consisting of biochar-added sludge compost under various operating parameters. Characterization of odor removal and microbial community in the cover layer under various operating parameters was conducted using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry and 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing, respectively. Results showed that H2S (76.9-86.0%) and volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) (12.3-21.7%) were dominant according to their theoretical generated odor concentrations. The total odor REs calculated using the theoretical odor concentrations in the landfill reactors were different than using the measured odor values, which were ranked from high to low as: R6 > R5 > R7 > R4 > R8 > R9 > R3 > R2 > R1, showing the largest discrepancy of 25.3%. The optimum combination of operating parameters based on the theoretical odor concentration was different with that based on the measured odor concentrations. Moreover, although Firmicutes (12.21-91.48%), Proteobacteria (3.55-51.03%), and Actinobacteria (4.01-47.39%) were in general the three major bacterial phyla found in the landfill covers, the detailed bacterial communities in the cover materials of the simulated reactors varied with various operating parameters. Alicyclobacillus and Tuberibacillus showed positive correlations with the removal efficiencies (REs) of chlorinated compounds, H2S, aromatic compounds, volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs), and organic acids. The correlations of Rhodanobacter, Gemmatimonas, Flavisolibacter and Sphingomonas were strongly positive with ammonia RE and relatively positive with REs of organic acids, VOSCs, and aromatic compounds. These findings are instrumental in understanding the relationship between the structure of microbial communities and odor removal performances, and in developing techniques for in-situ odor control at landfills.",Preservation of rumen fluid for the pretreatment of waste paper to improve methane production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109569,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"It is necessary to preserve rumen fluid for transport from slaughterhouses to the pretreatment facilities for use in treating lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, we investigated how the preservation of rumen fluid at various temperatures affects its use in hydrolysis of waste paper. Rumen fluid was preserved anaerobically at 4, 20, and 35 °C for 7 days. The number of protozoa and fibrolytic enzyme activity after preservation at 4 °C were significantly higher than that after preservation at either 20 or 35 °C. Waste paper was subsequently treated with preserved rumen fluid at 37 °C for 48 h. Preservation at 20 °C remarkedly decreased the hydrolysis of waste paper. Xylanase activity in rumen fluid preserved at 35 °C increased during the treatment, which enhanced the solubilization of waste paper as comparable to the control and preservation at 4 °C. Pretreatment of waste paper with rumen fluid preserved at 4 °C showed that the fluid retained high fibrolytic activity, and reduced the loss of organic carbon as substrate for methanogens. Our results suggest that preservation of rumen fluid at 4 °C is most suitable for efficient pretreatment and methane fermentation of waste paper.",A method for the rapid evaluation of leather biodegradability during the production phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109568,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Advances in technological-industrial processes have led to the development of new materials that generate different impacts on the environment when presented as waste. The application of sustainable manufacturing practices in order to improve the environmental behaviour of materials, including in the waste stage, is now an important industry responsibility. This study developed a new method for the rapid evaluation of leather biodegradability that can easily be operated by the tannery industry during the production phase. The method uses the OxiTop® system within which a solid sample is suspended in a liquid medium with no nutritional limitations at a constant temperature and stirring conditions. Ten leather samples were tested based on the existing methodology for determining aerobic biological activity (EN 16087-1: 2011), ultimate aerobic biodegradability of plastic materials in an aqueous medium (ISO 14851: 2004), and OECD 301F guidelines for testing of chemicals. The developed method has been shown to reliably distinguish (over 7 days) between samples produced using different manufacturing processes/treatments. Starch proved to be a better standard reference material for checking inoculum activity and the proper functioning of the measurement system than cellulose. Skin without treatment was shown to be a suitable reference material for defining the maximum biodegradation of leather materials. Double exponential and Gompertz mathematical models closely described the biodegradation of the tested samples. This method offers a way for industry to test and produce leather materials with higher levels of biodegradability, thus reducing the adverse environmental impacts of the final products when presented as solid waste."

For a separated ternary system of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE), adsorption behavior and selectivity mechanism of flotation reagents were investigated by multi-characterization tests and batch equilibrium adsorption method. Quantitative adsorption results indicate that frother polyethylene glycol (PEG) only acts on gas and liquid phases in the flotation system with negligible adsorption capacity onto solid phase. For depressant sodium lignosulphonate (SL), the pseudo-first-order and Langmuir isotherm models are suitable for corresponding kinetic and equilibrium data of PET or PVC. Thermodynamic parameters further indicate that the adsorption of SL is a spontaneous and endothermic process, which neither belongs to the pure physisorption nor to the pure chemisorption. Adsorption models of SL were established based on hydrogen bond, with three clear bonding types (OH…π*, OH…O, and OH…Cl). Selectivity mechanism can be attributed to the selective hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, which are provided by specific plastic and depressant, respectively. In the light of these theoretical fundings, new targeted reagents or pre-treatments are expected to be developed towards more complex flotation system.",Statistical analysis for the quality assessment of digestates from separately collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and agro-industrial feedstock. Should input feedstock to anaerobic digestion determine the legal status of digestate?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109555,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Management options for digestate produced by anaerobic digestion plants influence the environmental and economic sustainability of the biogas sector. Further, digestate can be both used or disposed of according to its legal classification: that is, waste or by-product, or product (by using End of Waste procedure). Currently, legal digestate status is decided by EU member states on a case-by-case basis, according to specific positive lists of input feedstocks and quality requirements in terms of physical properties and chemical concentrations. Biased exclusion of input feedstock can force digestate to a specific waste classification and undergo post-treatment and disposal options that can negatively affect the profitability of biogas installations. This is the case of the Italian regulation, where the positive list of input feedstock excludes a priori separately collected organic fractions of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), while including agro-industrial residues (AGRO). This study determined the differences between the two digestate typologies (OFMSW versus AGRO) through statistical analysis, implemented on a dataset, designed to gather data about digestate's physical-chemical parameters from relevant scientific literature and unpublished private databases. The datasets consisted of 190 entries, derived from more than 2,000 samples. Further, the study provided a compliance assessment between the resulting parameter means and the current regulation limits. Upper confidence limits for the means (level of significance α = 0.05) calculated for both digestate typologies were found to be compliant with the legal requirements. Therefore, no statistical ratio seems to support the difference in the legislative approach as proposed by Italian law-makers. OFMSW resulted significantly different from AGRO for VS (650.1 g/kg TS vs. 843.8 g/kg TS, respectively), N-NH4 (81.9 g/kg TS vs. 46.19 g/kg TS), N-TOT (109.7 g/kg TS vs. 65.32 g/kg TS), P-TOT (7.22 g/kg TS vs. 21.9 g/kg TS), Pb (18.6 mg/kg TS vs. 4.66 mg/kg TS), Ni (11.03 mg/kg TS vs. 8.20 mg/kg TS), Cr-TOT (12.74 mg/kg TS vs. 8.74 mg/kg TS) and Hg (0.08 mg/kg TS vs. 0.05 mg/kg TS). However, the statistical analysis must be implemented on a wider set of parameters not covered by this study (e.g. ecotoxicological features).",High resolution characterisation of E. coli proliferation profiles in livestock faeces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109554,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Agricultural intensification can lead to high volumes of livestock faeces being applied to land, either as solid or liquid manures or via direct defecation, and can result in reservoirs of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) persisting within farmland. Understanding the survival of FIOs, e.g. E. coli, in agricultural environments, and in particular within different livestock faeces, is key to developing catchment management practices for the protection of ecosystem services provided by clean water. Frequently, controlled laboratory studies, under constant temperature regimes, are used to determine the impact of environmental factors on E. coli persistence in livestock faeces; however, such studies oversimplify the diurnal variations and interactions of real world conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of E. coli using a controlled environment facility, which simulated diurnal variation of temperatures typically experienced during a British spring and summer. The approach provided a comparison of E. coli persistence profiles within faeces of sheep, beef cattle and dairy cattle to allow novel interpretations of E. coli regrowth patterns in contrasting livestock faeces in the period immediately post-defecation. Thus, the coupling of a tightly controlled environment facility with high resolution monitoring enabled the development of a new non-linear, asymptotic description of E. coli proliferation in livestock faeces, with increased potential for E. coli growth observed during warmer temperatures for all livestock types. While this study focused on temperatures typical of the UK, the occurrence of a phase of E. coli regrowth has implications for microbial water quality management worldwide.",A system dynamics modeling to evaluate flooding impacts on municipal solid waste management services.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109553,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"The municipal solid waste management service system has been one of the most important service provisions in the city. Complex linkages within the system are impacted by waste quantities and qualities. Due to the complex characteristic of stock and flow in a waste management system, it is difficult to design a sustainable management system that can handle varying conditions, particularly in case of a disaster. Interferences from the natural disaster i.e. flooding could potentially affect the entire MSWM system. Flooding is a major disaster in many regions of the world and poses a challenge as an external disturbance to any part of the waste management system. This research has applied the concept of system dynamics (SD) to understand patterns and evaluate flood impacts on the waste management systems of 22 districts that transport waste to the Nongkhaem transfer station in Bangkok, Thailand. The SD model of waste management illustrates waste generation trends and collection and transfer patterns to predict potential flood-affected areas. The research analyzed different flooding hazard scenarios and evaluated potential impacts within flood-prone areas. The results proved that flooding has various degree of impacts on the accumulated waste amounts of services areas within and outside the flooded areas. The findings can be a guideline to help prepare an appropriate mitigation plan for waste management under flood conditions.",Analysis on integrated thermal treatment of oil sludge by Aspen Plus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109552,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"An integrated thermal treatment (coupled pyrolysis and combustion) of oil sludge (OS) was proposed for enhancing the OS resource utilization. According to the pyrolysis experiment results, the integrated thermal treatment process of OS was modeled and simulated using Aspen Plus. Carbon flow, heat distribution, energy flow, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the process were analyzed and discussed. The results indicated that the simulation values were consistent with the experimental ones within the pyrolysis temperature of 00-780 °C With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the carbon flow of pyrolysis oil was firstly increased and then sharply decreased, and the maximum value was achieved at 600-650 °C. Carbon flow of pyrolysis gas was initially increased rapidly followed by a continuously decreasing growth rate, and then increased sharply above 650 °C. The maximum heating value of pyrolysis oil was obtained at 600 °C. When pyrolysis temperature exceeded 650 °C, both the pyrolysis gas production rate and the gas heating value were improved. The energy and the exergy efficiency of the system can reach values as high as 61-68% and 56-71%, respectively, and the maximum efficiencies were achieved at the pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C. The present work could provide valuable insights towards promoting the development of effective OS utilization processes in the near future.",Evaluation and comparison of pre-treatment techniques for recovering indium from discarded liquid crystal displays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109551,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Over the last years, emerging incentives for secondary production of high tech-metals, found in e-waste, are created because of their increasing demand and economic issues associated with their primary production. Due to the very low share of these metals in e-waste, pre-treatment methods can result in an output fraction rich in the metals of interest and may, therefore, be essential. To this scope, the present article evaluates and compares the efficiency of four different pre-treatment approaches containing various steps for recovering indium (In) from liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in laptop computers. The pre-treatment steps, used in various combinations, are (a) dry mechanical crushing and sieving, (b) pyrolysis, (c) thermal shock and (d) gravimetric process. Also, in all approaches, liquid crystals were removed from the samples, before applying the mechanical crushing step, as these are toxic and potentially harmful to human health and the environment. The removal was achieved by ultrasonic irradiation or mild agitation and optimized in terms of time, temperature and solvent type and concentration. Then, the feasibility of each pre-treatment approach was evaluated based on two parameters: (a) the content of In in the resulting sample after pre-treatment and (b) the separated mass share (%) with larger indium content as compared to the original LCD panel. The results showed that In is highly liberated in the fractions consisting of finest particles (<25 μm and <53 μm) after dry mechanical crushing and sieving with a maximum content of 234 mg/kg, which is twice as much as in the raw material. However, these particles represented only about 14 wt% of the original LCD panel mass. On the contrary, thermal shock results indicated that this was the most efficient pre-treatment approach, as both the content of In and the separated LCD mass (%) remained in high levels. Finally, some economic aspects associated with the processes are presented.",Experimental process parameters optimization and in-depth product characterizations for teak sawdust pyrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109550,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Pyrolysis is an efficient thermochemical route to obtain biofuels in the form of bio-oil, biochar and pyrolytic gas from the processing of biomass. Pyrolysis experiments were performed with teak sawdust to determine the yield and main characteristics of solid, liquid and gaseous products. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 400-700 °C in 100 °C intervals, nitrogen flow rate of 150-250 mL/min, packed bed height in between 2 and 8 cm and particle size in between 0.18 and 0.60 mm. The maximum bio-oil and biochar yield were observed at 600 °C (48.8%) and 400 °C (37.42%), respectively. Physical properties (viscosity, density, carbon residue, pH and HHV) of bio-oil were determined and the chemical properties were investigated using FTIR and GC-MS. Further, biochar was characterized with proximate, ultimate, HHV, FTIR, SEM-EDX, BET surface area and XRD analysis. Non-condensable gases coming out during pyrolysis were analyzed using gas chromatography and amount of H2, CH4, CO and CO2 were determined. According to characterization results, bio-oil can be used as biofuel after up gradation or as source of valuable chemicals, biochar can be utilized as solid fuel or seems to be suitable in waste stream purification as it has very high BET surface area. In addition, pyrolytic gases have significant amount of methane and hydrogen that provides good combustion properties.",Comprehensive exergoeconomic analysis of a municipal solid waste digestion plant equipped with a biogas genset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109549,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"A comprehensive exergoeconomic performance analysis of a municipal solid waste digestion plant integrated with a biogas genset was conducted throughout this study in order to highlight its bottlenecks for further improvements. Exergoeconomic performance parameters of each component of the plant were determined by solving exergy and cost balance equations based on Specific Exergy Costing (SPECO) approach. The analysis was conducted to reveal the cost structure of the plant based on actual operating information and economic data. The exergy unitary cost of two main products of the plant, i.e., bioelectricity and biofertilizer were determined at 26.27 and 2.27 USD/GJ, respectively. The genset showed the highest overall cost rate (101.27 USD/h) followed by digester (68.41 USD/h). Furthermore, the net bioelectricity amounted to 67.81% of the overall cost rate of the products, while this value was 32.19% for both liquid and dewatered digestates. According to the results obtained, efforts should mainly focus on enhancing the efficiency of the genset in order to boost the overall performance of the system exergoeconomically. In addition, minimizing the investment-related cost of the digester could also substantially enhance the exergoeconomic performance of the plant.",Valorization of chestnut (Castanea sativa) residues: Characterization of different materials and optimization of the acid-hydrolysis of chestnut burrs for the elaboration of culture broths.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109548,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Four kinds of waste from the industrial processing of chestnuts (Castanea sativa), namely leaves, pruned material and burrs from chestnut tree plus chestnut shells, were characterized to determine their content in polymers and thus their potential use in biorefinery processes.

Treatment with diluted sulfuric acid (prehydrolysis) allowed the solubilization of xylose, glucose and arabinose, but also some toxic compounds such as furan derivatives, aliphatic acids and phenolic constituents. Xylose, the main component released in the hemicellulosic hydrolyzates, was maximized by using a 3**(2-0) full factorial design combined with desirability function.

Three concentrations of activated charcoal (1, 2.5 and 5% w/v) were evaluated to remove certain unwanted byproducts, and it was found that under the highest dosage, 95.27 ± 0.03% of the color was removed with an almost total reduction of furan derivatives, making this liquor an appropriate basis for the development of suitable culture media for lactic acid bacteria. To validate this hypothesis three lactic acid bacteria, namely Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactococcus lactis were positively tested finding lactic acid yields of 0.89, 0.92 and 0.83 g/L·h respectively.",Scaling up the treatment of the fine fraction from landfill mining: Mass balance and cost structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109547,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"The treatment of the fine fraction (FF) obtained from landfill mining is necessary in order to reduce the amount of organic matter and biological activity in FF, thus increasing its potential to be utilized after landfill mining. This paper suggests the scaled up anaerobic and aerobic treatment of FF, with or without continuous irrigation, and presents the mass balance and cost structure of such treatment based on two hypothetical landfills. The physical treatment structure for the treatment of FF should prevent emissions, and in this paper, it includes suitable bottom and top liners as well as the collection and treatment of the gaseous and leachate emissions formed during the treatment. Methane produced in anaerobic treatments could either be utilized for energy recovery or be flared. The cost of the anaerobic and aerobic treatment of FF, including investments and operation costs, are 20-65 €/t FF, depending on size of the landfill. The costs of anaerobic treatment and passive aeration are similar, and active aeration is slightly more expensive, but the cost of the continuous irrigation is the most significant, as it multiplies the leachate treatment costs. The overall cost of treatment could be lowered by reducing the treatment time and utilizing existing landfill structures. The results of this paper can be used in planning and estimating the cost of the biological treatment of FF when evaluating landfill mining projects, as the fate of FF may have a major impact on the economics of landfill mining projects."

Statistics show that one tonne of wet-salted hides/skins yields around 650 kg of solid waste. Among various wastes generated, trimmings for the most part have been underutilized. Collagen presents in trimmings waste are effectively used but hair goes unutilized or at the most as feed for boilers during gelatin manufacturing. Hence, newer technology is needed for complete and effective utilization of raw trimmings. In leather manufacture, formaldehyde condensates polymers are used as re-tanning agent to enhance the compaction of leather. However, these products are hard for biodegradation and also cause the release of free formaldehyde in leather, which is a known carcinogen. Here, there is a need for development of formaldehyde free re-tanning agent for eco-benign leather processing. In this work an attempt had been made to develop formaldehyde free biodegradable eco-benign re-tanning agent from raw trimming of tannery solid waste as a circular economy model. Alkaline (7.5%w/w NaOH) - hydrogen peroxide (10%w/w) pre-treatment followed by thermal hydrolysis at 100 °C for 5 h was an optimized method for effective hydrolysis of trimmings and the process of preparation of product results in the holistic utilization of raw trimmings. The developed product was characterized using Dynamic light scattering and FTIR techniques. The product prepared was further used in leather manufacture as a re-tanning agent and was found to impart multifunctional properties to leathers such as fullness, grain tightness and shade of dye brilliance. Product improves the mechanical strength characteristics of leather and also the exhaustion of post-tanning chemicals. SEM analysis shows that the experimental leather is more compact and flat than control. This novel strategy had not only solved the issue of solid waste but also resulted in a greener leather auxiliary leading to greener environment.",Expanded cardboard waste sorting and occupational exposure to microbial species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109535,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Member states of the European Union have to maximize recycling. The current, Danish cardboard recycling system can be improved by increasing the kinds of cardboard products that can be recycled to include e.g. used beverage cartons and pizza boxes (i.e. an expanded cardboard fraction (ECF)). This study aims to obtain knowledge about exposure to airborne endotoxin and microorganisms at species level at different collection frequencies of ECF, and whether an increase in waste sorted fractions means that each waste fraction is collected less frequently. Bacterial and endotoxin concentrations were associated significantly with temperature inside the waste containers and endotoxin and fungal exposures with collection frequency. The concentration of fungi was highest at the truck back and for reduced collection frequencies. The geometric mean diameters of particles with bacteria were between 3.0 and 5.2 μm and with fungi between 3.8 μm and 6.0 μm. In total, 81 and 25 different bacterial and fungal species were found at the waste receiving plant, respectively. Work with ECF caused exposures to food-related microorganisms (e.g. Arthrobacter arilaitensis and Penicillium camemberti), potential pathogens (e.g. Bacillus cereus, Salmonella sp. and P. expansum), and commensal bacteria. Bacillus cereus and Salmonella were found in the particle size fraction often being swallowed. Workers collecting EFC will be at risk of being exposed to microbial species that normally are related to residual waste. It seems to be advisable with an EFC collection frequency shorter than eight weeks. However, introduction of new waste fractions has generally been associated with reduced collection frequencies.",Thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation kinetics and characteristics of poly (lactic acid) and its composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109534,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Thermal degradation behavior and kinetics of starch/PLA composites in an inert and oxygen atmosphere were investigated by TG and TG-FTIR techniques. It is shown that the thermal degradation process can be divided into three stages, and a significant difference between thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation is the third stage in which the residual chars are further cracked for the thermo-oxidative degradation. The activation energy was calculated using the iso-conversional Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method. The lower activation energy for thermo-oxidative degradation indicated that oxygen had an accelerated effect on thermal degradation. The variation of activation energy indicated that the decomposition of all the samples was a complex process that included at least two different mechanisms. Evolution of the evolved gaseous products with temperature was studied to understand the thermal and thermo-oxidative decomposition comprehensively. According to the TG-FTIR analysis, the gaseous products mainly contained lactide, cyclic oligomers, aldehydes, CO2, CO, and H2O.",Information publicity and resident's waste separation behavior: An empirical study based on the norm activation model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109533,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Waste separation is beneficial to minimize the negative environmental effects of waste and to promote the recycling use of waste. Based on the norm activation model framework, this study mainly focused on examining how information publicity about waste separation affects resident's waste separation intention. A questionnaire survey was conducted in China to collect the research data, and the data were analyzed by using the structural equation modeling technique. The results indicated that resident's awareness of consequences of not separating waste is positively and significantly associated with ascription of responsibility, and both of them are positively and significantly related to personal norm. Personal norm is positively associated with resident's waste separation intention. Furthermore, information publicity has a direct and positive effect on resident's waste separation intention. However, the effect is relatively small. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the effect of information publicity on waste separation intention depends on information quality. Information quality positively moderates the effect of information publicity on waste separation intention. The current study enriched the research on resident's waste separation behavior and highlighted the role of information publicity. Based on the results, policy implications about how to motivate residents to separate waste were discussed and the research limitations were pointed out.",Effect of MnO2 on biotic and abiotic pathways of humic-like substance formation during composting of different raw materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109532,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"The humic-like substances (HLS) are proposed to be formed by biotic and abiotic pathways. The abiotic pathways were neglected in existed composting studies. The present study aims to accelerate the abiotic pathways, and to investigate how MnO2 drives the HLS transformation via changing the contribution of abiotic and biotic pathways during composting with different materials. Parallel factor analysis model (PARAFAC), hetero two-dimensional correlation spectra (hetero-2DCOS) and variance partitioning were used to identify the effects of MnO2 on the formation of humic acid (HA) and fluvic acid (FA) during composting of chicken manure (CM) and corn straw (CS). The addition of MnO2 could change the structures of HLS during CS and CM composting, mainly promoting the formation of complex components in HA and FA during CS composting, as well as the complex components of FA during CM composting. Meanwhile, the addition of MnO2 could reshape the microbial ecology, which enhanced the correlation between microbes and complex components formation during composting, especially in CM composting. Variance partitioning showed that both abiotic and biotic pathways were stimulated in conversion of HLS components after adding MnO2 during CS composting, especially for the abiotic pathways. During CM composting, the MnO2 promoted biotic effects on the conversion of HLS components. Above all, the addition of MnO2 could stimulate pathways of biotic, abiotic or both of them to improve the humification degree of HLS by changing microbial ecology, which could be a promising way for promoting the application value of composting products.",Co-digestion of organic and mineral wastes for enhanced biogas production: Reactor performance and evolution of microbial community and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109531,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Mineral wastes (MWs) from municipal solid waste incineration plants and construction demolition sites are rich in minerals, heavy metals and have acid neutralising capacity. This renders such MWs a promising source of bulk and trace elements to enhance and stabilize biogas production in anaerobic processes. However, finding a MW with typical heavy metal concentrations, which promotes anaerobic digestion (AD) without adverse effects on the microbial community of the reactor is of major importance. To investigate the impact of several MW additives (1. incineration bottom ash; 2. fly ash; 3. boiler ash; 4. cement-based waste) as AD co-substrates, six 5 L single stage mesophilic, continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR) were setup. Two different feeding regimes were employed including: (a) a liquid-recycled feeding method (LRFM); (b) a draw-and-fill feeding method (DFFM). Under the LRFM regime, one gram MW per gram organic waste enhanced process stability (pH), increased methane production (25-45% increase), and yielded (450-520 mL CH4/g VS); DFFM enhanced digestibility to a lesser degree. Illumina HiSeq 16S rRNA community sequencing of reactors showed that the microbial community compositions were unaffected by the presence of MW additives in comparison to unamended controls, but MW amendment accelerated bacterial growth (determined by qPCR). In contrast, different feeding regimes altered the microbial communities; Methanoculleus (hydrogenotrophic) and Methanosaeta (acetoclastic) were the most abundant methanogenic genera in the LRFM reactors, and the more metabolically versatile Methanosarcina genus dominated under DFFM.",Construction waste generation estimates of institutional building projects: Leveraging waste hauling tickets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109530,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"The large proportions of waste generated from the construction industry have led to adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts, and as such, there is a need to promote construction waste management (CWM) practices. However, there is limited information regarding construction waste (CW) generated from nonresidential buildings available to support such CWM practices. This study seeks to quantify CW generated from a nonresidential institutional building project using CW data collected from 535 waste hauling tickets. These tickets provide a waste generation summary itemized by various CW streams. The CW data was collected through coordination with the project waste management team. Findings reveal that concrete/masonry is the highest waste stream during the Foundation (46% of CW) and Structural Concrete (88% of CW) stages. During the Masonry Work and Finishing Stage, wood is found to be the primary contributor (54% of CW), followed by concrete/masonry (35.3% of CW). The estimated CW generation rate was approximately 69 kg/m2, with the concrete/masonry and wood waste streams having the highest generation rates of 33.61 kg/m2 and 28.21 kg/m2, respectively, comprising 90% of the total CW across the project. Due to the temporal characteristics of different waste streams, varying CW dumpsters available onsite is recommended based on the construction stage, to mitigate space shortage impacts. Furthermore, this study quantifies the benefits of recycling CW as environmental savings of trees, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Findings of this study would help refine the accuracy of the reported estimates of CW generation for nonresidential construction projects. By shedding light on the corresponding handling practices of the generated waste and project management processes applied on institutional projects, the study can also serve as a guide to better plan for and coordinate the management of CW of these projects. Results may be used to promote and encourage the adoption of CWM practices at the site level to improve the sustainability performance of the construction industry.",Methane loss from commercially operating biogas upgrading plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109529,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Biogas technology is one of the widely applied anaerobic digestion approaches to harvest methane from different wastes. Recently, methane loss from biogas plants and its environmental and economic consequences have been underlined, but not thoroughly researched. In this investigation, process related CH4 loss from nine different commercially operating biogas upgrading plants such as water scrubber, amine, and membrane-based plants was examined. The result of the measurements showed an average of 0.81% methane loss with respect to supplied methane to the upgrading plants. A methane loss up to 1.97% was detected in water scrubber methane upgrading technology and up to 0.56% loss from membrane technology, while 0.04% methane loss was detected in amine based upgrading, thus the water scrubber has shown the most detrimental effect as regards methane loss. The regenerative thermal oxidizer was further applied to reduce CH4 emission by 99.5% of the amount of CH4 in the waste gas from the upgrading unit, which ensures the sustainable process of biogas production.",Effect of oxygen concentration on oxy-fuel combustion characteristic and interactions of coal gangue and pine sawdust.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109528,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Coal gangue is an inevitable coal waste from coal mine, which results in serious environmental problems. Oxy-fuel firing of coal waste and biomass waste is an alternative technology for efficient and clean utilization and CO2 reduction of coal waste. In this study, the oxy-fuel combustion characteristics and interactions of coal gangue and pine sawdust were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, with a focus on the effect of oxygen concentration on interactions between coal gangue and pine sawdust during oxy-fuel combustion. The oxy-fuel combustion of pine sawdust had two obvious stages, including the release of volatile matter and the combustion of the remaining char, which differed from oxy-fuel combustion of coal gangue with one overlapped stage of devolatilization and char oxidation. Moreover, the addition of pine sawdust could improve the oxy-fuel combustion reactivity of coal gangue. The significant deviations between the experimental derivative thermogravimetric curves and theoretical derivative thermogravimetric curves for the blends indicated that interactions between coal gangue and pine sawdust had occurred in the temperature range of 400-600 °C. The interaction mechanism was primarily thermal effect between coal gangue and pine sawdust during oxy-fuel combustion. The oxygen concentration had a significant effect on the interactions between coal gangue and pine sawdust. The increase of oxygen concentration from 20% to 40% could improve interactions between coal gangue and pine sawdust obviously. However, relative small improvement of interactions was detected between coal gangue and pine sawdust when oxygen concentration was further increased from 60% to 80%. This was related to the difference of rate controlling factor for oxy-fuel combustion reaction under various oxygen concentrations.","Mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic acidogenic fermentation of food waste in batch: Effect of inoculum source.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109527,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Distinctions in hydrolysis and acidogenesis were examined for a series of anaerobic batch reactors inoculated with three different anaerobic mixed cultures (mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic anaerobic sludge) and operated at the temperature of inoculum's origin and additionally at 70 °C. Hyperthermophilic temperatures led to increased hydrolysis rates during the start-up stage but a rapid drop in pH limited the overall hydrolysis efficiency, indicating the importance of pH control to sustain the high reaction rates at higher temperatures. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed among hydrolysis efficiencies obtained for different reactors which ranged between 27 ± 3% and 40 ± 14%. The highest fermentation yield of 0.44 g COD of fermentation products/g VSS-CODadded was obtained under thermophilic conditions, followed by mesophilic (0.33 g COD ferm. prod./g VSS-CODadded) and hyperthermophilic conditions (0.05-0.08 g COD ferm. prod./g VSS-CODadded). Fermentative performance was better at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions as indicated by improved production of volatile fatty acids (VFA). VFAs accounted for 60-71% of the solubilised matter at thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. Acetic acid formed the primary VFA (70%) at mesophilic temperatures, while butyric acid was the major VFA at thermophilic (60%) conditions. Hyperthermophilic conditions led to increased production of lactic acid, which comprised up to 32% of the solubilised matter. Overall, the results indicate that different operating temperatures may not significantly affect the substrate degradation efficiency but clearly influence the biotransformation pathways."

Plastic from HHW consists of numerous immiscible polymers, product types and product designs (e.g. colour, polymer separability), which often lead to considerable physical losses during sorting, and low-quality recycled plastic. Consequently, recycling initiatives have been proposed to enhance the quantity and quality of plastic recycling from HHW. To quantify the potential effects of such initiatives, a detailed composition of plastic waste is necessary. The aim was to provide such detailed composition of Danish source-separated rigid plastic waste, including information regarding the polymer of the main product component, product type, polymer design and separability as well as colour. The potential effects on recycled quantity and quality from implementing selected recycling initiatives were quantified and recommendations provided. PET, PE and PP made up >90% of the source-separated plastic and both food- and non-food packaging existed in all three polymers. In total, 10-11% of the plastic was black, and around 44% consisted of multiple polymers, of which one-third was non-separable. Initiatives improving product design for recycling will likely result in increased quantity of recycled plastic. By effectively separating food from non-food packaging, e.g. by introducing two bins in the households or politically aligning polymers and product types (all food packaging in PET and PP, all non-food packaging in PE), 39-63% of the waste could potentially be recycled in a closed loop into food-grade quality packaging. The overall highest benefits were reached by combining initiatives.",Novel epoxidized natural rubber composites with geopolymers from fly ash waste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109514,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Geopolymer (GP) based on fly ash waste from electric power generating plants has been applied in natural rubber composites as a sustainable solution to deal with this industrial solid waste. This alternative type of rubber filler can reduce hazards and environmental impacts of that waste. Novel elastomer composites based on geopolymer (GP) filled epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) were prepared with various GP loadings. Cure characteristics, mechanical, dynamic, thermal, and morphological properties of the ENR/GP composites were characterized. It was found that incorporating GP significantly affected cure characteristics of ENR compounds, decreasing scorch and cure times by accelerating the cure rate via the excessive metal oxides in GP. Furthermore, the ENR/GP composites with 15 phr GP showed the highest tensile strength due to maximal chemical linkages of hydroxyl groups and metal oxides on GP surfaces and epoxide groups in ENR. This was confirmed by a new FTIR peak for SiOH bending vibrations at the wavenumber 970 cm-1. Furthermore, the Payne effect in ENR/GP composites was assessed from the relationship of shear modulus and strain amplitude at a fixed oscillation frequency. It was found that the Payne effect, or the level of filler-filler interactions, increased with GP loading. In addition, it was also found that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of ENR/GP composites increased with GP loading. Furthermore, TGA and TSSR results suggest that the metal oxide in GP activated degradation of the rubber network at elevated temperatures.",Resource quality of wood waste: The importance of physical and chemical impurities in wood waste for recycling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109513,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Recycling of post-consumer wood waste into particleboard may be hindered by the presence of physical and chemical impurities in the waste stream, therefore calling for increased attention on the quality of wood waste. However, wood waste comprises several uses/types of wood, along with different levels of contamination. This study provides the detailed sampling and characterisation of wood waste according to its source, type and resource quality grade. Eight tonnes of wood waste, intended for recycling and collected at three Danish recycling centres, were subdivided into 34 individual material fractions and characterised with respect to the presence of three classes of physical impurities (misplacements, interfering materials and low-quality wood waste) as well as chemical concentrations of more than hundred chemical elements and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The results demonstrated that contaminant and concentration levels vary significantly according to wood waste type and source, thus emphasising that wood waste should not be viewed as a single material flow but rather be understood and managed according to the presence of individual fractions. Including only clean wood waste fractions at the three recycling centres, 41-87% of the collected wood waste per weight could be recycled - the rest being physical impurities. The results showed that chemical contamination was significantly higher for low-quality wood waste, thus clearly indicating that improvements in separate collection, sorting and handling of wood waste may improve the resource quality of wood waste and potentially achieve cleaner recycling practices.",Using polyvinyl alcohol to improve the deacidification performance of titanium white waste acid: Pilot tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109512,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Titanium white waste acid (TWWA) is strongly acidic, and has high metatitanic acid (TiO(OH)2) and n-hexane (C6H14) content. In this study, the effects of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on the modification of TWWA deacidification were evaluated via pilot testing. The results showed that the PVA solution can significantly improve the deacidification performance of TWWA. The TWWA specific resistance to filtration (SRF) decreased from the initial 2.42 × 1013 m/kg to 1.80 × 1012 m/kg when 2% PVA solution was added at 25% (v/v). Furthermore, the amount of filter press-processed TWWA increased by 3.56 m3 relative to the control, and the moisture content of titanium white slag was only 42.02% after deacidification. In addition, distillation and phase separation was demonstrated to efficiently separate C6H14 and hydrochloric acid (HCl) from the mixed filtrate. Moreover, titanium white slag was converted into rutile after 60 min when the calcination temperature was 900 °C, with the titanium dioxide (TiO2) purity of rutile reaching 91.83%. Accordingly, the TWWA recycling process proceeded as follows: PVA modification, solid-liquid separation, filtrate distillation and phase separation, and titanium white slag calcination. Our findings demonstrate that this process has unique practical application value.",Evaluation of orange peel waste and its biochar on greenhouse gas emissions and soil biochemical properties within a loess soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109511,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"The environmentally safe disposal of the large quantity of orange peels waste produced each day causes economic and environmental problems, which after conversion into biochar via pyrolysis technique might be used as an effective soil amendment. In this study, a 90-day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of orange peel waste and waste-derived biochar amendments on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), soil biochemical properties, and soil enzyme activities. There were five treatments with different amendment levels: control without an amendment (Control), orange waste 1% (W1), orange waste 2% (W2), orange waste biochar 1% (B1), and orange waste biochar 2% (B2). The results showed that, compared with control, the amendments decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 59.2% (B2), 45.2% (B1), 20.6% (W2) and 10.2% (W1), respectively; and increased cumulative CH4 emissions by 81.7% (W1), 84.4% (W2), 75.8% (B1) and 74.9% (B2), respectively. Cumulative CO2 emissions decreased for the B1 (29.3%) and B2 (43.5%) over the waste treatments. While soil pH, SOC, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and enzyme activities (urease and catalase) were significantly increased with the passage of time from the biochar amendments, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and invertase activities did not show this trend with time. Our study suggests that orange peel waste conversion to biochar should be a viable alternate method of disposal since land application resulted in reduced GHG and improvements in soil fertility.",Composting of halophyte Phragmites australis following phytoaccumulation of chloride from a cement kiln dust (CKD)-contaminated landfill.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109510,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Cement kiln dust (CKD) is a highly saline waste by-product of the cement manufacturing process.

In this paper, composting is explored as a sustainable disposal option for dealing with salt-contaminated plant waste. After one growing season (May - September 2015), shoots of P. australis were harvested and placed in laboratory tumbling composters for 12 months. The plant biomass (3720 ± 150 g) was reduced by 28 ± 6%, and with thorough rinsing, a 49 ± 18% reduction of chloride was achievable within the same time period. Composting was repeated outdoors at the field site in both closed tumbling composters, and open compost piles. In both cases, superior chloride concentration reductions of 87 ± 6% and 89 ± 8%, respectively were achieved. This is the first study to demonstrate that composting of harvested biomass following phytoextraction of salt can be used to sustainably manage plant waste.",Assessment of energy potential of wood industry wastes through thermochemical conversions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109509,"Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 21,"Three kinds of waste resulting from woods from the Colombian industry were selected (PinusPátula, Tectona Grandis and Acacia Mangium) in order to assess their energy potential. Several techniques of physicochemical characterization were used to predict the most appropriate energy exploitation process in each case; which was validated at laboratory scale by carrying out the torrefaction, gasification and combustion process. Results allowed us to the identification of the high energy potential of such wood waste as well as their feasibility to generate torrefied products and synthesis gas as products with greater added values. As a special case, the species Tectona Grandis displayed the greatest conversion and synthesis gas quality on the basis of the gasification process, due to its physicochemical characteristics.

In order to estimate potential environmental impacts, it is important to understand the association of the PTEs with the mineral phases. Large area phase mapping (SEM/EDX) using ""PhAse Recognition and Characterization - PARC"" software in combination with quantitative X-ray powder diffraction has been used to characterize amorphous and crystalline BA phases for the first time. The results show that one of the main incineration products was melilite and an amorphous phase with a melilitic composition. The ratio of crystalline to amorphous melilite was 1:2. They formed an inhomogeneous layer around BA particles and contained a high percentage of the PTEs, i.e., Cu, Zn, Ni and Cr. Other major sources of PTEs (especially Ni and Cu) were iron oxides produced during incineration and the weathering products, such as calcite and ettringite (Cu and Zn). After extensive characterization of BA, a sequential extraction procedure (SEP) was performed, which exposed bottom ash to different chemical environments designed to dissolve specific phases and release their PTEs into solution. The extracted solutions and solid residues generated from the extraction procedure were analyzed to identify the association between PTEs and dissolved phases of BA. By combining SEP results with information obtained via large area phase mapping it is shown that SEP can be used for studying the association of PTEs with the phase that cannot be investigated with XRD/EDX, such as organic matter and Fe-Mn-hydrous oxides. Furthermore, according to SEP results a high percentage (40-80 wt%) of each investigated PTE can be considered immobile and not susceptible to leaching in the environment.",Determining optimal ultrasound percent on time with long-pulse torsional phacoemulsification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109482,Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

As a second goal, it examined whether providing more autonomy to airport security officers (in the form of spontaneous rest breaks and adaptable automation) would improve their performance and subjective state. Seventy-two student participants had to indicate the presence (or absence) of a threat item (either a gun or a knife) in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of cabin baggage. Three work-rest schedules were examined: spontaneous breaks (i.e. participants could take breaks at any time), two 5-min breaks and two 10-min breaks during a 1-h testing session. Furthermore, half of the participants were assisted in their task by an adaptable support system offering three levels of automation: (1) no support, (2) cues indicating the presence of a potential threat item, and (3) cues indicating the exact location of a potential threat item. Results showed no performance differences between break regimes, which suggests that there may be viable alternatives to the current EU regulations.

The charts showed frequent changes in the nature of observed activities, with interleaved multitasking a constant feature and external prompts often clustered in time. Evidence of seniority-related differences in work were apparent with consultants switching between more concurrent patients and receiving more frequent clinical prompts than junior physicians, illustrating their overseeing and advice-giving role. The ubiquity of interleaved multitasking suggests a need to focus on developing individual strategies to support frequent cognitive switching.

Normalized muscle activation levels were significantly higher in women compared to men across the five tasks for each muscle group. Median muscular load ranged from 4.5% to 47.5% of the maximum voluntary contraction capacity for female participants and from 2.7% to 23.6% for male participants.

Whereas environmental and lifestyle factors are important at younger ages, the contribution of genetics appears more important in reaching extreme old age. Genome-wide studies have implicated ~57 gene loci in lifespan. Epigenomic changes during aging profoundly affect cellular function and stress resistance. Dysregulation of transcriptional and chromatin networks is likely a crucial component of aging. Large-scale bioinformatic analyses have revealed involvement of numerous interaction networks. As the young well-differentiated cell replicates into eventual senescence there is drift in the highly regulated chromatin marks towards an entropic middle-ground between repressed and active, such that genes that were previously inactive ""leak"". There is a breakdown in chromatin connectivity such that topologically associated domains and their insulators weaken, and well-defined blocks of constitutive heterochromatin give way to generalized, senescence-associated heterochromatin, foci.

A few studies have already demonstrated benefits of clinical pharmacists supporting physicians' prescribing. Nevertheless, there are still open questions about pharmaceutical interventions at the nursing level in order to optimise pain therapy sustainably. We performed a prospective controlled follow-up intervention study to analyse the sustainability of improved pain measurement performance (PMP) and its therapeutic consequences. Half a year after a successful guidance implementation in two study units (control and intervention unit), pharmacists performed an individual coaching for nurses only in the intervention unit. We consecutively monitored patient-nurse contacts and evaluated PMP with a 7-point scale (from 0: no pain measurement to 6: optimal pain measurement) in three 4-week periods (t1 : before guidance implementation, t₂ : directly after guidance implementation, t₃ : half a year after guidance implementation) on both units. Therapeutic consequences of PMP were evaluated in a post-hoc patient chart review. In the t1 period, we found a median PMP of 0 in both units which rose to 6 (control unit) vs. 5 (intervention unit) in t₂ period due to guidance implementation in both units. In the t₃ period, we found a decrease of PMP to 0 in controls vs. to 4 in the intervention unit (p<0.001).

The appearance of PTPs was assessed using a pharmaceutical design database (PDD) of 2,750 pharmaceutical tablets comprising approximately 40 % of the 6,840 products marketed in Japan. Package sheet color (Sc), tablet color (Tc), character color (Cc), sheet line color (SLc), and upper color (Uc) were used to evaluate the uniformity of PTP sheet design. To assess the risk of misidentification, 1,000 prescriptions for 82,273 cancer patients were retrieved from 21,026,742 records in the claims database of the Japan Medical Data Center Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. The most frequent PTP sheet colors for 143 drugs were Sc (silver), Tc (white), Cc (blue), SLc (none), and Uc (silver). The prescribing pattern of 1000 randomly chosen prescriptions was analyzed. Database records of prescriptions without tablets (n = 69), including only one PTP tablet (n = 292), and those with lack of PDD prescription data (n = 388) were excluded. Eventually, 236 prescriptions were evaluated. Fourteen prescriptions (5.9%) had PTP sheets with five matching elements and 29 had with four matching elements (12.3%). This novel PDD database for information technology concept easily identified similar PTP sheets involved in prescriptions dispensed in 18 % of evaluated cancer patients. The concept seems to be applicable for preventing look-alike dispensing errors.",Association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and autoimmune disorders: Data mining of the spontaneous reporting system in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109402,Die Pharmazie,2019 05 21,"The main objective of this study is to conduct a disproportionality analysis of adverse events in the Japan Adverse Event Report (JADER) database and evaluate the risk of the DPP-4 inhibitor induced autoimmune disorder, the secondary objective is risk assessment of sex difference and age difference. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) of frequency-based statistics and Bayesian estimates of the information components (IC) were calculated as a measure of signal detection. Sex difference and age difference were evaluated using signal score calculated from the PRR and the Chi-square. In patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors, 94 reports of autoimmune disorders were detected with both signals; PRR: 4.09, chi-square: 158.26 and IC: 1.66, 95 % confidence interval: 1.32-2.00). For other antidiabetic drugs, no signals were detected. The signal of males was PRR: 4.53, chi-square: 110.91 and signal score: 6.22, the signal of female was PRR: 3.53, chi-square: 47.65 and signal score: 5.12. About age difference, the signal scores were 6.71 for patients over 60 years and 0.56 for patients under 60 years old. This study suggests that the DPP-4 inhibitors, unlike other antidiabetic drugs, were associated with autoimmune disorders. Signals of the DPP-4 inhibitors induced autoimmune disorders were detected in both male and female, but no sex difference was observed, but age difference was observed. Especially attention should be paid to patients over 60 years old.",Angiogenin regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma through upregulation of HMGA2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109401,Die Pharmazie,2019 05 21,"Angiogenin (ANG) is known to alter multiple cell behaviors by directly targeting downstream targets, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated. The expression of ANG in HCC cell lines was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The effects of ANG expression on cell proliferation, cell migration, and hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were also investigated. The relationship between ANG and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) was evaluated. ANG expression was increased in HCC cell lines. Downregulating of ANG inhibits proliferation, migration, and EMT of HCC cells. The direct regulation of ANG on HMGA2 was verified by luciferase activity reporter assay and western blot assay. Furthermore, overexpression of HMGA2 reversed the inhibitory effects of ANG downregulation on HCC cell behaviors. Our results illustrated the mechanism that ANG promote the EMT of HCC through targeting HMGA2.",LncRNA NR2F1-AS1 is involved in the progression of endometrial cancer by sponging miR-363 to target SOX4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109400,Die Pharmazie,2019 05 21,"This study intended to investigate the role of lncRNA NR2F1-AS1 in endometrial cancer (EC). The expression level of NR2F1-AS1 in tumor tissues and EC cells was measured. After sh-NR2F1-AS1 transfection, the cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion of EC cells were analyzed. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to investigate the target gene of miR-363. The expression levels of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway-associated factors were assayed using western blot. NR2F1-AS1 was significantly overexpressed in EC tissues and cells. NR2F1-AS1 inhibition decreased EC cell viability, migration and invasion, while promoted cell apoptosis. miR-363 was negatively regulated by NR2F1-AS1. SOX4 was a target of miR-363. NR2F1-AS1 functioned on EC progression via PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway. The results demonstrated that NR2F1-AS1 was highly expressed in EC, which involved in the proliferation and migration of EC cells through downregulation of miR-363 to target SOX4 and regulating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway.",Miconazole triggers various forms of cell death in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109399,Die Pharmazie,2019 05 21,"In recent years, ""drug repurposing"" has become an important approach and focus of studies on anti-tumor drug research and development (R&D). As one of the first-generation broad-spectrum imidazole anti-fungal drugs, miconazole (MCZ) exhibits anti-tumor effects in addition to its anti-fungal effect. However, no report has focused on examining the effect of MCZ on the proliferation and cell-death of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. MCZ significantly inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We also observed that MCZ induced both apoptosis and necroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed submicroscopic structures in these cells, which correspond to necrotic features, in addition to the characteristic features of apoptosis. Pretreatment of cells with z-VAD-fmk, an apoptosis inhibitor or Nec-1, a necroptosis inhibitor, significantly increased their viability compared with MCZ treatment. The initial mechanism of MCZ-mediated cell death in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells involves an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, downregulation of apoptosis induced by Akt and p-Akt-473, a simultaneous upregulation of the receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein expression, and ROS production to induce necroptosis. Our results suggest that MCZ may be a potential lead compound for the development of anti-breast cancer drugs.",Color change in Perlodel® tablets induced by LED lighting - photolysis of bromocriptine mesylate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109398,Die Pharmazie,2019 05 21,"Various types of fluorescent lights are found in the dispensing rooms of medical facilities, such as hospitals and pharmacies, in Japan. However, to reduce electric power consumption, it was necessary to evaluate the substitution of fluorescent lighting with light emitting diode (LED) lighting, which has become widespread in recent years. We subjectively evaluated several types of medicines stored under various light sources and found that different color changes were induced in tablets. In this study, we focused on Perlodel ® tablets, containing 2.5 mg bromocriptine mesylate, as an example for the objective evaluation of the differences in the color change of tablets when stored under LED lighting and fluorescent lighting. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of part of the tablet surface area revealed a change from white to light brown or dark brown after 28 days of irradiation, with a residual concentration of bromocriptine mesylate of 85.5 % under fluorescent lighting, 85.6 % under daylight-color LED lighting, 90.3 % under bulb-color LED lighting, and 99.2 % in the dark. In addition, the ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectral study of the absorbance of a photo-product at 400-550 nm indicated that the color change of the Perlodel® 2.5 mg tablet was caused by photochemical degradation of bromocriptine mesylate. Thus, this analysis of the photochemical changes in drugs stored under different light sources demonstrated the potency of LED lights. Through the objective evaluation of the color change, the cause of the color change was determined; this will allow us to develop a strategy that minimizes possible disadvantages to patients, such as a decrease in treatment efficacy owing to decomposition of the main component or adverse caused by decomposed matter.",Azithromycin nanocrystals for dermal prevention of tick bite infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109397,Die Pharmazie,2019 05 21,"Azithromycin was optimized as nanocrystals with a drug content of 10.0 % (w/w) and a surfactant D-α -tocopheryl polyethylenglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) content of 1.0 % (w/w) using bead milling for 10 min. The photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) diameter of the bulk population was 189 nm, laser diffraction (LD) diameter 90 % was 370 nm. Spherical morphology of the optimal nanocrystals was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). They were stable over 1 year of storage at 4 °C with the particle size within the nanometer range which was confirmed by PCS, LD and light microscope. An acceptable physical stability of 2 years was also obtained when stored at 4 °C. No microbial attack to the nanocrystals was observed before 3 years storage at 4 °C. The saturation solubility of the nanocrystals was up to triple compared to the raw drug powder (RDP) in water. When incorporated into the gel base, highest penetration efficacy was achieved by the optimal nanocrystals compared to 1) the clinically effective ethanol-solution-gel, 2) the gel with propylene glycol and 3) the gel with RDP in the ex vivo porcine ear penetration study. Even though propylene glycol improved saturation solubility of nanocrystals, it could not bring benefit to nanocrystals in the penetration study. Based on these optimized azithromycin nanocrystals, topical administration for enhanced dermal bioavailability of azithromycin seems to be feasible."

However, little is known about the physiological brain region- and cell type-specific HTT expression pattern in wild type mice and a potential recruitment of endogenous HTT to other pathogenic protein aggregates such as amyloid plaques in cross seeding events. Employing a monoclonal anti-HTT antibody directed against the HTT mid-region and using brain tissue of three different mouse strains, we detected prominent immunoreactivity in a number of brain areas, particularly in cholinergic cranial nerve nuclei, while ubiquitous neuronal staining appeared faint. The region-specific distribution of endogenous HTT was found to be comparable in wild type rat and hamster brain. In human amyloid precursor protein transgenic Tg2576 mice with amyloid plaque pathology, similar neuronal HTT expression patterns and a distinct association of HTT with Abeta plaques were revealed by immunohistochemical double labelling. Additionally, the localization of HTT in reactive astrocytes was demonstrated for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease animal model. Both, plaque association of HTT and occurrence in astrocytes appeared to be age-dependent. Astrocytic HTT gene and protein expression was confirmed in primary cultures by RT-qPCR and by immunocytochemistry. We provide the first detailed analysis of physiological HTT expression in rodent brain and, under pathological conditions, demonstrate HTT aggregation in proximity to Abeta plaques and Abeta-induced astrocytic expression of endogenous HTT in Tg2576 mice.",Replication of multiple system atrophy prions in primary astrocyte cultures from transgenic mice expressing human α-synuclein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109379,Acta neuropathologica communications,2019 06 10,"Glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) containing aggregated and hyperphosphorylated α-synuclein are the signature neuropathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Native α-synuclein can adopt a prion conformation that self-propagates and spreads throughout the brain ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration. A growing body of evidence argues that, in addition to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes contain α-synuclein inclusions in MSA and other α-synucleinopathies at advanced stages of disease. To study the role of astrocytes in MSA, we added MSA brain homogenate to primary cultures of astrocytes from transgenic (Tg) mouse lines expressing human α-synuclein. Astrocytes from four Tg lines, expressing either wild-type or mutant (A53T or A30P) human α-synuclein, propagated and accumulated α-synuclein prions. Furthermore, we found that MSA-infected astrocytes formed two morphologically distinct α-synuclein inclusions: filamentous and granular. Both types of cytoplasmic inclusions shared several features characteristic of α-synuclein inclusions in synucleinopathies: hyperphosphorylation preceded by aggregation, ubiquitination, thioflavin S-positivity, and co-localization with p62. Our findings demonstrate that human α-synuclein forms distinct inclusion morphologies and propagates within cultured Tg astrocytes exposed to MSA prions, indicating that α-synuclein expression determines the tropism of inclusion formation in certain cells. Thus, our work may prove useful in elucidating the role of astrocytes in the pathogenic mechanisms that feature in neurodegeneration caused by MSA prions.",Comparative analyses of the in vivo induction and transmission of α-synuclein pathology in transgenic mice by MSA brain lysate and recombinant α-synuclein fibrils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109378,Acta neuropathologica communications,2019 06 10,"α-synuclein (αS) is the major component of several types of brain pathological inclusions that define neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. Central nervous system (CNS) inoculation studies using either in vitro polymerized αS fibrils or in vivo derived lysates containing αS aggregates to induce the progressive spread of αS inclusion pathology in animal disease models have supported the notion that αS mediated progressive neurodegeneration can occur by a prion-like mechanism. We have previously shown that neonatal brain inoculation with preformed αS fibrils in hemizygous M20+/- transgenic mice expressing wild type human αS and to a lesser extent in non-transgenic mice can result in a concentration-dependent progressive induction of CNS αS pathology. Recent studies using brain lysates from patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), characterized by αS inclusion pathology in oligodendrocytes, indicate that these may be uniquely potent at inducing αS pathology with prion-like strain specificity. We demonstrate here that brain lysates from MSA patients, but not control individuals, can induce αS pathology following neonatal brain inoculation in transgenic mice expressing A53T human αS (M83 line), but not in transgenic expressing wild type human αS (M20 line) or non-transgenic mice within the timeframe of the study design. Further, we show that neuroanatomical and immunohistochemical properties of the pathology induced by MSA brain lysates is very similar to what is produced by the neonatal brain injection of preformed human αS fibrils in hemizygous M83+/- transgenic mice. Collectively, these findings reinforce the idea that the intrinsic traits of the M83 mouse model dominates over any putative prion-like strain properties of MSA αS seeds that can induce pathology.",Experiential learning for primary healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109377,Systematic reviews,2019 06 10,Improving the quality of primary healthcare services is one of the global health priorities.

However, the scale up of this synthesis is hindered by the second step, which uses an expensive catalyst and is an exothermic reaction, with hydrogen release and a relatively low molar yield (70%). We have previously explored the ""Green Chemistry"" alternative of using E. coli strains overexpressing the nitroreductase NfsB as a whole-cell-biocatalyst to replace this second step, although the molar yield in this case was lower than that of the chemical synthesis.",Bovine serum albumin-templated nanoplatform for magnetic resonance imaging-guided chemodynamic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109332,Journal of nanobiotechnology,2019 06 10,"Nanotechnology in medicine has greatly expanded the therapeutic strategy that may be explored for cancer treatment by exploiting the specific tumor microenvironment such as mild acidity, high glutathione (GSH) concentration and overproduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

The undesired inconsistency could be mainly attributed to the molecular weight (MW) of the polycations, that is, polymers with high MW and positive charge densities exhibited enhanced transfection efficiency but with associated cytotoxicity. To address such critical challenge, we developed the degradable high MW polymers strategy which could condense DNA for the internalization and release DNA upon the trigger-responsive degradation. In this work, two kinds of degradable PEI-based polymers were prepared via the polyaddition of PEI600 and dienes with ester groups or thiol ketal groups. The PEI-based degradable polymers could efficiently condense plasmid DNA to form the nano-complexes with the size around 180 nm. They also exhibited improved gene delivery efficiency compared with commercial available transfection reagent, PEI25k, and were 380-520 folds higher than PEI600 in HeLa cells. The toxicity of the polymers could be reduced by the rapid degradation upon acid or ROS triggering as well as intracellular release of DNA and the cell viability could reach higher than 80% even at high doses. ROS-responsive PEI-based polymers also demonstrated its potential applications especially in cancer cells, which were proved by the enhanced in vivo gene expression in cancer cells. Our strategy therefore allows an effective tool to manipulate the relationship between transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity of polycations, and thus provides an effective insight into the rational design of non-viral gene delivery vectors.",Collagen-hydroxyapatite composite substitute and bone marrow nuclear cells on posterolateral spine fusion in sheep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109260,Journal of biomaterials applications,2019 05 21,"The effects of a large collagen-hydroxyapatite (COL-HA) substitute with or without isolated bone marrow nuclear cells (BMNC) on spine fusion were evaluated using a two-level posterolateral spinal fusion model in sheep. Six sheep each were included in both the COL-HA and autograft groups. In each animal, spine fusions were performed at two levels by randomization with or without BMNC. After an observation period of 4.5 months, the fusion blocks (length = 50 mm) were harvested and evaluated by micro-CT with respect to fusion rate and microarchitecture, and histology was performed to qualitatively assess new bone morphology. BMNC supplementation did not lead to significant differences in fusion rates or microarchitectural properties in the both groups ( p = 0.56). Porosity decreased significantly in the COL-HA group ( p = 0.002), suggesting a relatively fast degradation of COL-HA. Qualitative histology assessment revealed quick reabsorption of COL-HA replaced by newly formed bone, and this new bone morphology was similar to autograft. Interestingly, COL-HA generated significant amounts of new bone in vivo which were similar to autograft, and the presence of BMNC seemed to enhance this process. Apart from porosity, the comparable fusion rate and similar microarchitectural parameters suggested equal performance of COL-HA and autograft with respect to spine fusion and bone quality. In conclusion, the COL-HA with BMNC demonstrated comparable fusion rates as the autograft. COL-HA was capable of forming new bone and was revealed to be similar to the autograft with respect to microarchitectural properties apart from porosity of the fusion blocks.",High density lipoprotein coated calcium carbonate nanoparticle for chemotherapy of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109259,Journal of biomaterials applications,2019 05 21,"Satisfactory chemotherapy of breast cancer remains to be a great challenge in both experimental and clinical practice.

The test, which takes 8 min for the entire team, incorporates subjective measures of well-being (RTT-Q), and objective measures of the autonomic system (HRR60s) and neuromuscular function (SLJ). The aim of this study was to present the rationale for the FFITT as a novel athlete monitoring protocol and to measure the reliability of each component of the test. The internal consistency of the RTT-Q questions ranged from α = 0.69-0.92. All questions had an α > 0.83, with one exception of question 'Rate the well-being/stress your school/university/work is causing you to feel' which had an α = 0.69. The reliability of the HRR60s and SLJ was high (R = 0.92, and 0.91 respectively). The absolute typical error of measurement (TEM) of the SLJ was 8 cm and HRR60s was 3 beats. When expressed relatively the CVTEM of HRR60s was 8.4% and SLJ was 3.0%. Based on the TEM the HRR60s and SLJ could detect medium and large changes in fatigue and fitness. In absolute terms this equates to more than 5 bpm (HRR60s) and more than 13 cm (SLJ). The FFITT has the potential to satisfy both scientific principles and the coach's demands of a practical monitoring protocol for frequent use in a team.",The Association of Serum Testosterone Levels With Recurrence and Mortality After Acute Ischemic Stroke in Males.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109237,American journal of men's health,2019 06 16,"The current study aimed to investigate whether low testosterone predicted the recurrence and clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in males. From June 2015 through August 2017, the study prospectively enrolled 110 male AIS patients. All received detailed evaluations at admission and were followed for at least 1 year. The cumulative incidence, overall survival, length of hospital stay, and the percentage of previous stroke were compared between subjects with testosterone <440 ng/dl and >440 ng/dl. The median age was 62 years (range, 35-93 years). The median serum testosterone at admission was 438 [203] ng/dl (range, 44-816 ng/dl); 55 patients (50%) had testosterone <440 ng/dl and were considered as low testosterone. The median follow-up was 23 months. During the period, 12 recurrences and 10 deaths occurred. The 1-year and 3-year cumulative recurrence rate were 8.3% and 11.9%, respectively; the 1-year and 3-year overall survival were 96.3% and 84.6%, respectively. The cumulative recurrence rates were similar between the two testosterone groups (log-rank test, p = .88). Low testosterone was associated with poor survival with marginal significance (log-rank test, p = .079). Men with low testosterone had a higher percentage of previous stroke (29.1% versus 12.7%, p = .035). The mean lengths of hospital stay were similar between the two testosterone groups (16.6 ± 15.8 days versus 14.0 ± 10.6, p = .31). Total testosterone at admission fails to predict stroke recurrence. However, men with low testosterone at admission are more likely to have previous stroke and may have a higher all-cause mortality rate after AIS.",Structure and dynamics analysis of a new member heparinase II/III of family 12 polysaccharide lyase from Pseudopedobacter saltans by computational modeling and small-angle X-ray scattering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109236,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 06 03,"The structure of heparinase II/III belonging to family 12 polysaccharide lyase (PsPL12a) from Pseudopedobacter saltans was generated by homology modeling. Multiple sequence alignment showed conserved (Asn216, Tyr270 and His400) and semi-conserved active site amino acid residues. The modeled structure of PsPL12a displayed α/α toroid domain at N-terminal and antiparallel β sheets at C-terminal domain. The modeled structure was similar to those of heparinases from polysaccharide lyase 12 and 21 families. Validation of PsPL12a model by Ramachandran plot showed 94.6% of residues in the favored region, 5.2% of residues in the allowed region and only 0.2% of residues in the outlier region. The area and volume computed for PsPL12a displayed nearly a closed conformation of the active site, similar to HepIII from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The charge calculation on the surface of the PsPL12a structure showed the higher distribution of positive charge in the active site cleft as compared with other homologous structures. Molecular docking study of MD-simulated PsPL12a structure with heparin oligosaccharide showed high binding affinity as compared with heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. Comparison of the active site of modeled PsPL12a with other homologous heparinases revealed putative catalytic triad involving the residues Asn216, His400 and Tyr270.

Using the data of 1,743 at-risk youth from the 2016 survey of Korean adolescents' contact with media usage and harmful environment, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. This study shows that factors associated with the adolescents' experiences of family relationships, violence victimization, and harmful environment influence the occurrence of runaway behavior in at-risk adolescents. A significant outcome of this study is the identification of a harmful environment as a factor affecting runaway behavior. The factors identified need to be considered in the development of prevention programs targeting runway behavior among at-risk youth. School nurses are uniquely positioned to review and revise educational strategies to raise adolescents' awareness regarding the effects of harmful environments and to promote violence prevention. This framework provides school nurses with systematic methods for early identification and management of risk factors among at-risk youth runway behavior.",Concentration of Selected Elements and Antioxidative Potential in a Group of Males Working in the Metal Industry: Elements And Antioxidative Potential In Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109234,American journal of men's health,2019 06 16,"The purpose of this study was to show that some elements have a proven antioxidative effect and are essential for the proper development and functioning of the human body. The study also assessed the concentration of selected elements and total antioxidant status (TAS) in a group of male inhabitants of Białystok, Poland, who are professionally active in the metal industry. The study group comprised 163 men aged 55-64 years. The concentration of the analyzed elements was determined using flame (Zn and Cu) and electrothermal (Se, Cd, and Pb) atomic absorption spectrometry. Spectrophotometric test kits were used to assay the TAS and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in serum. The results suggested the mean concentration of Se in serum was 54.04 ± 12.10 μg/L, which was below the reference range. A significant negative correlation was observed between the concentration of Se in the serum and Pb and Cd concentrations in the whole blood of the studied men. The concentrations of the other elements, antioxidant potential, and GR activity were within the reference range. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between Pb and Cd, indicating combined exposure and a considerable negative correlation between lead and selenium as well as between lead and TAS. Selenium and TAS are likely to modify the adverse effects of Pb in the bodies of the studied men. The results indicate that it is necessary to constantly monitor men who are occupationally exposed to heavy metals, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and introduce effective preventive measures at a local level."

The increased number of EMRs since the introduction of the screening program for colorectal cancer has resulted in an increase in EMR-related complications. This review summarizes the current knowledge for the use of clips for the treatment and prevention of complications after EMR. Areas covered: The historical development of clips is summarized and their properties are evaluated. An overview is presented of the evidence for therapeutic and prophylactic clipping for bleeding or perforation after EMR in the colon. Several clipping techniques are discussed in relation to the efficacy of wound closure. Furthermore, new techniques that will likely influence the use of clips in the future endoscopic practice, such as endoscopic full-thickness resection (eFTR) are also highlighted. Expert commentary: Most research focuses on prophylactic clipping for delayed bleeding after EMR of large adenomas. We advocate a distance of 0.5-1.0 cm between aligning clips. This focus may likely shift from bleeding to perforation. Here, endoscopic treatment with through-the-scope clips and large-diameter clips may well replace surgery. The future role of clips will also depend on the further development of new endoscopic technologies, such as eFTR.",Serum levels of spexin are increased in the third trimester pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109216,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 05 21,"Spexin is a peptide that is involved in energy homeostasis and its expression is influenced by altered glucose metabolism. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased insulin resistance (IR) and pregnancy is a progressive insulin resistant state. We hypothesized that spexin may have an effect on the pathophysiology of GDM which further could help to identify the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate spexin levels in the third trimester pregnancies with GDM and healthy controls. Thirty-nine women with GDM and 39 healthy singleton pregnancies were enrolled in this case-control study. Serum spexin concentrations were measured and correlated to biochemical and clinical parameters. Serum spexin levels were significantly higher in women with GDM (3686.25 ± 348.37 vs. 3472.33 ± 293.93 pg/ml, p=.004). Spexin levels ​​did not differ significantly according to treatment modality. Moreover, spexin levels were significantly positively correlated with homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR). Spexin levels were significantly higher in women with GDM and closely related to HOMA-IR in the third trimester pregnancy.

Over time, researchers developed and refined four versions of the tool - Team, Individual, Patient and Support Person - eliciting feedback from learners, providers, patients and family members to create 360-degree evaluations of team performance. Development of all four versions of the JTOG into a native mobile application facilitated workplace based assessment, enhancing the ability to collect real-time data, gather responses from a variety of stakeholders and provide timely feedback to practice teams and individuals. Several studies have found the JTOG to be feasible to administer in both educational and practice settings across all user groups. Data also suggest the tool is a valid measure of team performance and individual performance on teams. However, scores that trended high indicate the need for continued psychometric work and high demand for the tool highlights the importance of a more robust database and dynamic analytic support. Three main conclusions have emerged from our experience with the JTOG: there is a clear need for a competency-based assessment tool to assist educators and clinicians in improving team functioning; incorporating technology into assessment may help bridge the persistent gap between educational innovation in IPE and organizational change in practice; and an assessment strategy incorporating the voices of the patient and family is highly valued by key stakeholders and has the potential to influence patient experience.",Hallux sesamoid fractures in young athletes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109214,The Physician and sportsmedicine,2019 06 05,"Objective: To describe the evaluation, management and recovery time of hallux sesamoid fractures in young athletes. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed in a large academic teaching institution over a 5-year period (1/1/2010-12/31/2014). All patients with a sesamoid injury were initially included. Excluded were those patients who: 1) did not receive the diagnosis of hallux sesamoid fracture, had a history of prior foot surgery, or had medical records inadequate for analysis, 2) had missing or unclear diagnostic imaging, 3) were age >21 years, or 4) did not report sports participation. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the data. Results: Fifty-eight patients (51 females and 7 males) with a mean age of 15.4 years (range: 9-21) were identified with a total of 59 sesamoid fractures. Dancing (37.9%), running (13.8%), and gymnastics (13.8%) were the most common sports reported among these patients. A greater number of fractures were classified as repetitive stress injuries (83.1%), rather than acute traumatic injuries (16.9%). Fractures were treated conservatively in the majority of cases (89.8%), and only six fractures (10.2%) were treated surgically. Most patients (84.7%) were able to return to sports and activities. The average time from diagnosis/start of treatment to pain-free state/cleared to return to sport was 161.4 days. Conclusion: Diagnosis of sesamoid fractures can be challenging, but overall most patients do well with conservative treatment and are able to return to sports and activities. Providers should keep sesamoid fracture in the differential when evaluating patients with pain in the area around the base of the first toe, especially in dancers, gymnasts, and runners. Understanding that the recovery from a sesamoid fracture can be a prolonged process may help patients develop realistic expectations.","""It Was as Though My Spirit Left, Like They Killed Me"": The Disruptive Impact of an HIV-Positive Diagnosis among Women in the Dominican Republic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109213,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care,2019 05 21,"An HIV diagnosis may be associated with severe emotional and psychological distress, which can contribute to delays in care or poor self-management.

Nearly all respondents described the news as deeply distressful and feelings of depression and loss of self-worth were common. Several reported struggling with the decision to disclose-worrying about stigma. Postdiagnosis turning points consisted of a focus on survival and motherhood; social support (family members, friends, HIV community) promoted integration.

Many caregivers, especially those caring for patients with primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT), report feeling overwhelmed by providing care. Social support can be protective for caregiving, but there is little research on the composition of social networks of caregivers. The research describes these social networks. Caregivers were recruited from a neuro-oncology clinic at an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in the United States from May to August 2017. Caregivers listed social network resources that they either have approached or could approach for help in six caregiving areas. Twenty-eight caregivers provided social network data. Most caregivers had at least some support in each category, with the most people in hands on and emotional support. Communication and financial support were less populated and were most likely to have no resources listed. Most resources were unique to one support category, but a smaller number of resources provided multiple types of support.

In line with the predictions, female-to-male transgender individuals experienced more jealousy than male-to-female transgender individuals in response to a physically dominant rival, whereas male-to-female individuals experienced more jealousy than female-to-male individuals in response to a physically attractive rival. Regardless of their gender identity, in both groups social-communal attributes were the most jealousy-evoking characteristic. Overall, the results indicate that transgender individuals mainly respond in line with their gender identity and not in line with their biological sex when facing romantic rivals. In addition, transgender individuals high in ISC experienced relatively more jealousy in response to all rival characteristics, whereas SCO was only among male-to-female individuals associated with jealousy.","Natural History, Quality of Life, and Outcome in Cardiac Transthyretin Amyloidosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109193,Circulation,2019 05 21,Transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure in older individuals.

Cardiovascular quality and outcomes,2019 05 21,"Background Conducting randomized controlled trials to investigate survival in a rare disease like pulmonary arterial hypertension has considerable ethical and logistical constraints. In many studies, such as the Study with an Endothelin Receptor Antagonist in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension to Improve Clinical Outcome (SERAPHIN) randomized controlled trial, evaluating survival is further complicated by bias introduced by allowing active therapy among placebo-treated patients who clinically deteriorate. Methods and Results SERAPHIN enrolled and followed patients in the same time frame as the US Registry to Evaluate Early And Long-term PAH Disease Management, providing an opportunity to compare observed survival for SERAPHIN patients with predicted survival had they received real-world treatment as in the Registry to Evaluate Early And Long-term PAH Disease Management. From the Registry to Evaluate Early And Long-term PAH Disease Management (N=3515), 734 patients who met SERAPHIN eligibility criteria were selected and their data used to build a prediction model for time to death up to 3 years based on 10 baseline prognostic variables. The model was used to predict a survival curve for each of the 742 SERAPHIN patients via their baseline variables. The average of these predicted survival curves was compared with observed survival of the placebo (n=250) and macitentan 10 mg (n=242) groups using a log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model. Observed mortality risk for patients randomized to placebo, 62% of whom were taking background pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy, tended to be lower than that predicted for all SERAPHIN patients (16% lower; P=0.259). The observed placebo survival curve closely approximated the predicted survival curve for the first 15 months. Beyond that time, observed risk of mortality decreased compared with predicted mortality, potentially reflecting the impact of crossover of patients in the placebo group to active therapy. Over 3 years, risk of mortality observed with macitentan 10 mg was 35% lower than predicted mortality ( P=0.010). Conclusions These analyses show that, in a rare disease, real-world observational data can complement randomized controlled trial data to overcome some challenges associated with assessing survival in the setting of a randomized controlled trial.

Among health professionals, surveillance in connection with noninfectious diseases is not as known as in infections where it has clearly proven successful. The principle of epidemiological surveillance may be applied in chronic noninfectious diseases but certain pitfalls and differences between this category and infectious diseases need to be borne in mind. These diseases have multifactorial etiology; their development is contributed to by several risk factors, mainly those associated with lifestyle; they have a long preclinical period with no apparent problems; data on their prevalence in populations may vary depending on the definition and diagnostic criteria used. Epidemiological surveillance as a continuous process aids in understanding the extent of the risk of a disease in a population, contributes to provision of early and effective care and control over their prevalence.

The only potentially curative approach is surgical resection of tumor. However, the rate of local and distant recurrence after radical surgery is still high. Benefit of adjuvant therapy is not clearly defined, nevertheless patients at high risk of recurrence are indicated to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Locally advanced, unresectable disease can also be treated with chemotherapy alone, or with her combination with radiotherapy. Required radiation doses are relatively high, therefore it is necessary to use highly conformal radiation therapy. Treatment of metastatic disease is currently based on systemic therapy, combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin as standard of care. Benefit of targeted molecular therapy is not clear at present, but ongoing research in genetic profiling of tumor may help to improve current clinical practice.

Its only potentially curative treatment option is a radical surgical resection. The aim of our work was to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of intraoperative ERCP and direct cholangioscopy (SpyGlass) to assess the intraductal border of cholangiocarcinoma proliferation. The study ran from November 2015 to January 2018. The group included patients with histologically verified cholangiocarcinoma and, based on available examinations, the resectability of the tumor was assessed by a multidisciplinary team. In cases of indicated surgical resection we peroperatively performed ERCP with cholangioscopy SpyGlass and ""diaphanoscopy"" in all patients. The resectability was assessed on the basis of these examinations and the peroperative surgical findings. The resection procedure itself was performed only in 2 out of the total of 14 patients, as other patients were indicated for the implantation of metallic SEMS within the ERCP procedure in the operating room instead. To validate the cholangioscopic findings, we used our own criteria based on both the Monaco and other criteria. We divided the findings according to the presence or absence of ulceration, prominent polyposis, pathological vascularization (4 types), pressure defect with a coagulum in the presence of previous stent implantation, papillomatous changes or discolorations of the mucosa. Out of the total number of 14 patients only two patients were indicated for resection and in both cases R0 resection was achieved. The remaining patients were intraoperatively indicated for palliative implantation of SEMS based on the same unresectable finding during cholangioscopy and laparotomy. We demonstrated the technical feasibility and safety of direct peroperative cholangioscopy.

It is a malignancy with a variable biological etiology, numerous genetic and epigenetic changes. Its incidence in the Czech Republic is about 1.4 per 100,000 people per year. For good prognosis and long-term survival, early diagnosis with surgical treatment is important. In these cases, a 5-year survival rate is about 20-40 %. In the early diagnosis imaging methods and histopathological verification play an essential role, whereas laboratory oncomarkers are not yet sufficiently accurate. The same applies for genetic markers. This leads to the search of new molecular targets and the high effort in the introduction of cytological and molecular-biological methods with high specificity and sensitivity into routine practice. Current early diagnosis is based on the use of efficient imaging methods. The use of genetic testing, and especially knowledge of the molecular basis of this disease, will be of a great benefit.

At the same time, there is a lack of understanding of the exact material properties that induce therapeutic effects in biological systems, which limits their rational optimization for the related medical applications. This study sets the foundation for a general approach for elucidating nanoparticle properties as determinants of antibacterial activity, with a particular focus on calcium phosphate nanoparticles. To that end, nine physicochemical effects were studied and a number of them were refuted, thus putting an end to frequently erred hypotheses in the literature. Rather than having one key particle property responsible for eliciting the antibacterial effect, a complex synergy of factors is shown to be at work, including (a) nanoscopic size; (b) elevated intracellular free calcium levels due to nanoparticle solubility; (c) diffusivity and favorable electrostatic properties of the nanoparticle surface, primarily low net charge and high charge density; and (d) the dynamics of perpetual exchange of ultrafine clusters across the particle/solution interface. On the positive side, this multifaceted mechanism is less prone to induce bacterial resistance to the therapy and can be a gateway to the sphere of personalized medicine. On a more problematic side, it implies a less intense effect compared to single-target molecular therapies and a difficulty of elucidating the exact mechanisms of action, while also making the rational design of theirs for this type of medical application a challenge.","Alternative Tobacco Products Use among Late Adolescents in Kelantan, Malaysia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109161,Korean journal of family medicine,2019 05 21,The rising prevalence of alternative tobacco and nicotine products (ATNPs) use among adolescents is a global concern that has been attributed to the reemergence of preexisting alternative tobacco products and emergence of new ones in the market.

Uveal melanoma-affected patients greatly benefited from recent advances of the research in this eye cancer. Tumour biology, genetics, epigenetics and immunology contributed significantly in elucidating the role of different genes and related pathways during uveal melanoma onset/progression and UM treatments. Indeed, these investigations allowed identification of new target genes and to develop new therapeutic strategies/compounds to cure this aggressive melanoma of the eye.

It is widely known that non-resolving inflammation results in atherosclerotic conditions, which are responsible for a host of downstream pathologies including thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), and neurovascular events. Macrophages, as part of the innate immune response, are among the most important cell types in every stage of atherosclerosis. In this review we discuss the principles governing macrophage function in the healthy and infarcted heart. More specifically, how cardiac macrophages participate in myocardial infarction as well as cardiac repair and remodeling. The intricate balance between phenotypically heterogeneous populations of macrophages in the heart have profound and highly orchestrated effects during different phases of myocardial infarction. In the early ""inflammatory"" stage of MI, resident cardiac macrophages are replaced by classically activated macrophages derived from the bone marrow and spleen. And while the macrophage population shifts towards an alternatively activated phenotype, the inflammatory response subsides giving way to the ""reparative/proliferative"" phase. Lastly, we describe the therapeutic potential of cardiac macrophages in the context of cell-mediated cardio-protection. Promising results demonstrate innovative concepts; one employing a subset of yolk sac-derived, cardiac macrophages that have complete restorative capacity in the injured myocardium of neonatal mice, and in another example, post-conditioning of cardiac macrophages with cardiosphere-derived cells significantly improved patient's post-MI diagnoses.",Plasmon-Enhanced Blue-Light Emission of Stable Perovskite Quantum Dot Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109145,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"A series of stable and color-tunable MAPbBr3-xClx quantum dot membranes were fabricated via a cost-efficient high-throughput technology.

Hence, nano-mist sauna bathing is expected to be useful for health without the risks that arise at high temperatures. In this study, we performed a comprehensive proteomics analysis of urine samples obtained from healthy volunteers before and after they had taken a sauna bath with nano-mist (n = 10) or with conventional mist (n = 10) daily for two weeks (4 groups). The average numbers of urine proteins identified by liquid chromatography-linked mass chromatography in each group varied from 678 to 753. Interestingly, the protein number was increased after sauna bathing both with nano-mist or with conventional mist. Quantitative analysis indicated that considerable numbers of proteins were obviously up-regulated, with more than two-folds in urine samples after the nano-mist sauna bathing. The KEGG pathway analysis showed significant stimulation of the lysosome pathway (p = 5.89E-6) after the nano-mist bathing, which may indicate the nano-mist sauna bathing promotes metabolism related to the lysosome pathway more efficiently than conventional mist sauna bathing and may provide more health benefits.",Cylindrical Layered Bone Scaffolds with Anisotropic Mechanical Properties as Potential Drug Delivery Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109143,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"3D cylindrical layered scaffolds with anisotropic mechanical properties were prepared according to a new and simple method, which involves gelatin foaming, deposition of foamed strips, in situ crosslinking, strip rolling and lyophilization.

Before lyophilization, the strips were curled in a concentric structure to generate anisotropic spiral-cylindrical scaffolds. The scaffolds displayed significantly higher values of stress at break and of the Young modulus in compression along the longitudinal than the transverse direction. Further improvement of the mechanical properties was achieved by adding strontium-substituted hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) to the scaffold composition and by increasing genipin concentration. Moreover, composition modulated also water uptake ability and degradation behavior. The scaffolds showed a sustained strontium release, suggesting possible applications for the local treatment of abnormally high bone resorption.

It has been repeatedly shown that chromosome heterogeneity manifesting as chromosomal mosaicism is associated with a variety of human diseases. Due to the ability of changing dynamically throughout the ontogeny, chromosomal mosaicism may mediate genome/chromosome instability and intercellular diversity in health and disease in a bottleneck fashion. However, the ubiquity of negligibly small populations of cells with abnormal karyotypes results in difficulties of the interpretation and detection, which may be nonetheless solved by post-genomic cytogenomic technologies. In the post-genomic era, it has become possible to uncover molecular and cellular pathways to genome/chromosome instability (chromosomal mosaicism or heterogeneity) using advanced whole-genome scanning technologies and bioinformatic tools. Furthermore, the opportunities to determine the effect of chromosomal abnormalities on the cellular phenotype seem to be useful for uncovering the intrinsic consequences of chromosomal mosaicism. Accordingly, a post-genomic review of chromosomal mosaicism in the ontogenetic and pathogenetic contexts appears to be required.

However, research in Vigna unguiculata is dramatically hampered by the lack of mutant resources and efficient tools for gene inactivation in vivo. In this study, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). We applied the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology to efficiently disrupt the representative symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) gene in Vigna unguiculata. Our customized guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting symbiosis receptor-like kinase (SYMRK) achieved ~67% mutagenic efficiency in hairy-root-transformed plants, and nodule formation was completely blocked in the mutants with both alleles disrupted.

Introduction of hydrophobic molecules into a hydrogel often results in irregular arrangement of the motifs, and further phase separation of hydrophobic domains, but limited efforts have been made to resolve this challenge in developing the hydrophobically-modified hydrogel. Therefore, this study presents an advanced integrative strategy to incorporate hydrophobic domains regularly in a hydrogel using self-assembled domains formed with polymer cross-linkers, building blocks of a hydrogel. Self-assemblies formed by polymer cross-linkers were examined as micro-domains to incorporate hydrophobic motifs in a hydrogel. The self-assembled structures in a pre-gelled solution were confirmed with the fluorescence analysis and the hydrophobicity of a hydrogel could be tuned by incorporating the hydrophobic chains in a controlled manner. Overall, the results of this study would greatly serve to tuning performance of a wide array of hydrophobically-modified hydrogels in drug delivery, cell therapies and tissue engineering.",Prognostic Impact of Low Skeletal Muscle Mass on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Coronary Artery Disease: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis of a Single Center All-Comer Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109123,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 21,"The impact of sarcopenia on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia on coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 475 patients with CAD who underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and computed tomography (CT) were enrolled. The cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle at the first lumbar (L1) vertebral level was measured, and sex-specific cut-off values of L1 skeletal muscle index (L1 SMI; male <31.00 cm2/m2, female <25.00 cm2/m2) were obtained. The primary outcome was 3-year all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome was 3-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Low L1 SMI was present in 141 (29.7%) of 475 patients. The incidence of all-cause mortality (23.7% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001) and MACEs (39.6% vs. 11.8%, p < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with low L1 SMI than in those with high L1 SMI. In multivariate analysis, low L1 SMI was an independent predictor of higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 4.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.95-8.45; p < 0.001) and MACEs (HR: 3.76; 95% CI: 2.27-6.23; p < 0.001). These findings remained consistent after propensity score-matched analysis with 91 patient pairs (C-statistic = 0.848).

The antenna comprises a symmetrical arrangement of four-square patches that are interconnected to each other with cross-shaped high impedance microstrip lines. The antenna array is excited through a single feedline connected to one of the patches. The proposed antenna array configuration overcomes the main drawback of conventional MPA with a narrow bandwidth that is typically <5%. The antenna exhibits a super-wide frequency bandwidth from 20 GHz to 120 GHz for S11 < -15 dB, which corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 142.85%. The antenna's performance of bandwidth, impedance match, and radiation gain were enhanced by etching slots on the patches. With the inclusion of the slot, the maximum radiation gain and efficiency of the MPA increased to 15.11 dBi and 85.79% at 80 GHz, which showed an improvement of 2.58 dBi and 12.54%, respectively. The dimension of each patch antenna was 4.3 × 5.3 mm2. The results showed that the proposed MPA is useful for various existing and emerging communication systems such as ultra-wideband (UWB) communications, RFID systems, massive multiple-output multiple-input (MIMO) for 5G, and radar systems.",Multi-Stage Hough Space Calculation for Lane Markings Detection via IMU and Vision Fusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109121,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"It is challenging to achieve robust lane detection based on a single frame, particularly when complicated driving scenarios are present. A novel approach based on multiple frames is proposed in this paper by taking advantage of the fusion of vision and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). Hough space is employed as a storage medium where lane markings can be stored and visited conveniently. The detection of lane markings is achieved by the following steps. Firstly, primary line segments are extracted from a basic Hough space, which is calculated by Hough Transform. Secondly, a CNN-based classifier is introduced to measure the confidence probability of each line segment, and transforms the basic Hough space into a probabilistic Hough space. In the third step, pose information provided by the IMU is applied to align previous probabilistic Hough spaces to the current one and a filtered probabilistic Hough space is acquired by smoothing the primary probabilistic Hough space across frames. Finally, valid line segments with probability higher than 0.7 are extracted from the filtered probabilistic Hough space. The proposed approach is applied experimentally, and the results demonstrate a satisfying performance compared to various existing methods.",Enhanced Stability and Driving Performance of GO⁻Ag-NW-based Ionic Electroactive Polymer Actuators with Triton X-100-PEDOT:PSS Nanofibrils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109120,Polymers,2019 05 21,"Ionic electroactive polymers (IEAPs) have received considerable attention for their flexibility, lightweight composition, large displacement, and low-voltage activation. Recently, many metal-nonmetal composite electrodes have been actively studied. Specifically, graphene oxide-silver nanowire (GO-Ag NW) composite electrodes offer advantages among IEAPs with metal-nonmetal composite electrodes. However, GO-Ag NW composite electrodes still show a decrease in displacement owing to low stability and durability during driving. Therefore, the durability and stability of the IEAPs with metal-nonmetal composite electrodes must be improved. One way to improve the device durability is coating the electrode surface with a protective layer. This layer must have enough flexibility and suitable electrical properties such that it does not hinder the IEAPs' driving. Herein, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) protective layer and 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenyl-polyethylene glycol (Triton X-100) are applied to improve driving performance. Triton X-100 is a nonionic surfactant that transforms the PEDOT:PSS capsule into a nanofibril structure. In this study, a mixed Triton X-100/PEDOT:PSS protective layer at an optimum weight ratio was coated onto the GO-Ag NW composite-electrode-based IEAPs under various conditions. The IEAP actuators based on GO-Ag NW composite electrodes with a protective layer of PEDOT:PSS treated with Triton X-100 showed the best stability and durability.",Roles of Hepatitis B Virus Mutations in the Viral Reactivation after Immunosuppression Therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109119,Viruses,2019 05 21,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major problem in patients receiving chemotherapy for malignant diseases or immunosuppression therapies. It has been thought that a reduction in the immune responses might result in the reactivation of HBV replication from covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) residing in hepatocytes. However, not only the host's immune status, but also viral mutations have been reported to be associated with reactivation. Especially, several case reports about amino acid mutations in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) that escape from immune reactions have been reported, and recent reports showed that the frequencies of such mutations are higher than previously expected. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of viral mutations, including immune escape mutations in HBV-reactivated patients, and discuss their significance.",Therapeutic Potential of a Combination of Magnesium Hydroxide Nanoparticles and Sericin for Epithelial Corneal Wound Healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109118,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"We previously found the instillation of sericin to be useful as therapy for keratopathy with or without diabetes mellitus. In this study, we investigated whether a combination of solid magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (MHN) enhances epithelial corneal wound healing by sericin using rabbits, normal rats and type 2 diabetes mellitus rats with debrided corneal epithelium (ex vivo and in vivo studies). Ophthalmic formulations containing sericin and MHN (N-Ser) were prepared using a bead mill method. The mean particle size of the N-Ser was 110.3 nm at the time of preparation, and 148.1 nm one month later. The instillation of N-Ser had no effect on the amount of lacrimal fluid in normal rabbits (in vivo), but the MHN in N-Ser was found to expand the intercellular space in ex vivo rat corneas. In addition, the instillation of N-Ser increased the phosphorylation of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK)1/2, a factor involved in cell adhesion and cell proliferation in the corneal epithelium, in comparison with the instillation of sericin alone. The combination with MHN enhanced epithelial corneal wound healing by sericin in rat debrided corneal epithelium (in vivo). This study provides significant information to prepare potent drugs to cure severe keratopathy, such as diabetic keratopathy.","Neuroprotective and Anti-Amyloid β Effect and Main Chemical Profiles of White Tea: Comparison Against Green, Oolong and Black Tea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109117,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"White tea (WT) is one of six tea types originally derived from Fujian Province, China. White tea is known for its health-promoting properties. However, the neuroprotective and anti-aggregatory properties of WT against the hallmark toxic Alzheimer's protein, Aβ have not been investigated. In this study, WT, green tea (GT), oolong tea (OT) and black tea (BT) were manufactured using tea leaves from the cultivar Camellia sinensis (Jin Guanyin). The protective effects of these tea extracts were then studied under oxidative stress conditions via t-bhp and H2O2 exposure, in addition to Aβ treatment using a PC-12 cell model. Each tea type failed to rescue PC-12 cells from either t-bhp or H2O2-mediated toxicity, however each extract exerted significant protection against Aβ-evoked neurotoxicity. Results of the Thioflavin T Kinetic (ThT) and TEM assay showed that Aβ aggregate formation was inhibited by each tea type. Additionally, TEM also supported the different anti-aggregatory effect of WT by modifying Aβ into an amorphous and punctate aggregate morphology. Higher accumulated precedent or potential neuroprotective compounds in WT, including ECG''3Me, 8-C-ascorbyl-EGCG, GABA and Gln, in addition to flavonol or flavone glycosides detected by using UPLC-QTOF-MS and UPLC-QqQ-MS, may contribute to a favourable anti-aggregative and neuroprotective effect of WT against Aβ.",Effects of Inflammation and Depression on Telomere Length in Young Adults in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109116,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 21,"Little is known about the associations of inflammation and depression with telomere length. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, the current study assessed the effects of inflammation and depression on telomere length in 1141 young adults in the USA. Depression status was assessed from the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview and inflammation status was measured based on C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Information on telomere length was obtained using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method to measure telomere length relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Unadjusted and adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between the tertiles of CRP concentration and the telomere length stratified by the status of depression such as major depression or depressed affect vs. no depression. The adjusted models were controlled for age, family poverty income ratio, race/ethnicity, marital status, physical activity, body mass index, and alcohol drinking status. A significant and decreasing linear trend in telomere length was found as CRP levels increased in men, regardless of the depression status, and women with major depression or depressed affect (p values < 0.05). Among men without depression, those with an elevated CRP level had increased odds of having a shortened telomere length compared to men with low CRP levels after controlling for covariates (adjusted odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.90). In women, there was no association between CRP and telomere length, regardless of the depression status. In conclusion, there was a significant and inverse association between inflammation and telomere length according to the depression status in men but not in women. The present findings may be of clinical significance for the monitoring of inflammation levels and depression status as determinants of telomere length.","Anti-Obesity Effect of Extract from Nelumbo Nucifera L., Morus Alba L., and Raphanus Sativus Mixture in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and C57BL/6J Obese Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109115,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"The antioxidant and anti-adipogenic activities of a mixture of Nelumbo nucifera L., Morus alba L., and Raphanus sativus were investigated and their anti-obesity activities were established in vitro and in vivo. Among the 26 different mixtures of extraction solvent and mixture ratios, ethanol extract mixture no. 1 (EM01) showed the highest antioxidant (α,α-Diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl, total phenolic contents) and anti-adipogenic (Oil-Red O staining) activities. EM01 inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to quercetin-3-O-glucuronide. Furthermore, body, liver, and adipose tissue weights decreased in the high-fat diet (HFD)-EM01 group compared to in the high-fat diet control group (HFD-CTL). EM01 lowered blood glucose levels elevated by the HFD. Lipid profiles were improved following EM01 treatment. Serum adiponectin significantly increased, while leptin, insulin growth factor-1, non-esterified fatty acid, and glucose significantly decreased in the HFD-EM01 group. Adipogenesis and lipogenesis-related genes were suppressed, while fat oxidation-related genes increased following EM01 administration. Thus, EM01 may be a natural anti-obesity agent."

On the other hand, in some other countries this plant is classified as a noxious weed. As a harmful weed, A. cordifolia is reported to have the ability to smother all native vegetation, collapse canopies of tall trees, cultivate as a ground cover and disrupt native seedling development. There is no available information about the involvement of any allelochemicals from A. cordifolia related to these issues. The present study evaluated the allelopathic effect by isolating and identifying the allelopathic substance from A. cordifolia leaf extract. The allelopathic potency of A. cordifolia was determined by a series of bioassays of shoot and root growth on some selected test plants. Separation and purification of the active substances was achieved through several chromatography processes. Finally, the substances with allelopathic activity were identified through high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) analysis and determined by the specific rotation of compound, proton and carbon NMR spectroscopies. The results show that A. cordifolia possesses allelopathic properties which affect other plant species. The isolated compound from the plant material, 3-hydroxy-alpha-ionone, may contribute to the allelopathic effects of A. cordifolia.",Antioxidant Activity and Anthocyanin Contents in Olives (cv Cellina di Nardò) during Ripening and after Fermentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109100,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"The olive tree ""Cellina di Nardò"" (CdN) is one of the most widespread cultivars in Southern Italy, mainly grown in the Provinces of Lecce, Taranto, and Brindisi over a total of about 60,000 hectares. Although this cultivar is mainly used for oil production, the drupes are also suitable and potentially marketable as table olives. When used for this purpose, olives are harvested after complete maturation, which gives to them a naturally black color due to anthocyanin accumulation. This survey reports for the first time on the total phenolic content (TPC), anthocyanin characterization, and antioxidant activity of CdN olive fruits during ripening and after fermentation. The antioxidant activity (AA) was determined using three different methods. Data showed that TPC increased during maturation, reaching values two times higher in completely ripened olives. Anthocyanins were found only in mature olives and the concentrations reached up to 5.3 g/kg dry weight. AA was determined for the four ripening stages, and was particularly high in the totally black olive fruit, in accordance with TPC and anthocyanin amounts. Moreover, the CdN olives showed a higher TPC and a greater AA compared to other black table olives produced by cultivars commonly grown for this purpose. These data demonstrate the great potential of black table CdN olives, a product that combines exceptional organoleptic properties with a remarkable antioxidant capacity.",Mechanisms Involved in the Relationship between Low Calcium Intake and High Blood Pressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109099,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"There is increasing epidemiologic and animal evidence that a low calcium diet increases blood pressure. The aim of this review is to compile the information on the link between low calcium intake and blood pressure. Calcium intake may regulate blood pressure by modifying intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells and by varying vascular volume through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Low calcium intake produces a rise of parathyroid gland activity. The parathyroid hormone increases intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscles resulting in vasoconstriction. Parathyroidectomized animals did not show an increase in blood pressure when fed a low calcium diet as did sham-operated animals. Low calcium intake also increases the synthesis of calcitriol in a direct manner or mediated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Calcitriol increases intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells. Both low calcium intake and PTH may stimulate renin release and consequently angiotensin II and aldosterone synthesis. We are willing with this review to promote discussions and contributions to achieve a better understanding of these mechanisms, and if required, the design of future studies.",Magnetic Graphene Oxide Nanocarrier for Targeted Delivery of Cisplatin: A Perspective for Glioblastoma Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109098,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Selective vectorization of Cisplatin (CisPt) to Glioblastoma U87 cells was exploited by the fabrication of a hybrid nanocarrier composed of magnetic γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and nanographene oxide (NGO).

The morphological and thermogravimetric analysis proved the effective binding of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles onto NGO layers. The magnetization measured under magnetic fields up to 7 Tesla at room temperature revealed superparamagnetic-like behavior with a maximum value of MS = 15 emu/g and coercivity HC ≈ 0 Oe within experimental error. The nanohybrid was found to possess high affinity towards CisPt, and a rather slow fractional release profile of 80% after 250 h.

IBDs are concomitant conditions of industrialized societies, and diet is a potential culprit. Consumption of ultra-processed food has increased over the last decade in industrialized countries, and epidemiological studies have found associations between ultra-processed food consumption and chronic diseases. Further studies are now required to identify the potential culprit in ultra-processed food, such as a poor nutritional composition or the presence of food additives. In our review, we will focus on food additives, i.e., substances from packaging in contact with food, and compounds formed during production, processing, and storage. A literature search using PubMed from inception to January 2019 was performed to identify relevant studies on diet and/or food additive and their role in IBDs. Manuscripts published in English from basic science, epidemiological studies, or clinical trials were selected and reviewed. We found numerous experimental studies highlighting the key role of food additives in IBD exacerbation but epidemiological studies on food additives on IBD risk are still limited. As diet is a modifiable environmental risk factor, this may offer a scientific rationale for providing dietary advice for IBD patients.",An Exploration of the Roles of Ferric Iron Chelation-Strategy Components in the Leaves and Roots of Maize Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109096,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Plants have developed sophisticated mechanisms for acquiring iron from the soil. In the graminaceous species, a chelation strategy is in charge, in order to take up ferric iron from the rhizosphere. The ferric iron chelation-strategy components may also be present in the aerial plant parts. The aim of this work was to search for possible roles of those components in maize leaves. To this end, the expression patterns of ferric iron chelation-strategy components were monitored in the leaves and roots of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal sulfur-deprived maize plants, both before and after sulfate supply. The two levels of sulfur supply were chosen due to the strong impact of this nutrient on iron homeostasis, whilst mycorrhizal symbiosis was chosen as a treatment that forces the plant to optimize its photosynthetic efficiency, in order to feed the fungus. The results, in combination with the findings of our previous works, suggest a role for the aforementioned components in ferric chelation and/or unloading from the xylem vessels to the aerial plant parts. It is proposed that the gene expression of the DMA exporter ZmTOM1 can be used as an early indicator for the establishment of a mycorrhizal symbiotic relationship in maize.",Constituents Isolated from the Leaves of Glycyrrhizauralansis and Their Anti-Inflammatory Activities on LPS-Induced RAW264.7 Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109095,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Licorice, the root and rhizome of Glycyrrhiza uralansis Fisch, is one of the most frequently used Traditional Chinese Medicines in rigorous clinical trials to remove toxins and sputum, and to relieve coughing.

Nostoc flagelliforme, an edible cyanobacterium with herbal value, serves as an unexploited bioresource for small molecules. In natural environments, N. flagelliforme undergoes repeated cycles of rehydration and dehydration, which are interrupted by either long- or short-term dormancy. In this study, we performed an untargeted metabolite profiling of N. flagelliforme samples at three physiological states: Dormant (S1), physiologically fully recovered after rehydration (S2), and physiologically partially inhibited following dehydration (S3). Significant metabolome differences were identified based on the OPLS-DA (orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis) model. In total, 183 differential metabolites (95 up-regulated; 88 down-regulated) were found during the rehydration process (S2 vs. S1), and 130 (seven up-regulated; 123 down-regulated) during the dehydration process (S3 vs. S2). Thus, it seemed that the metabolites' biosynthesis mainly took place in the rehydration process while the degradation or possible conversion occurred in the dehydration process. In addition, lipid profile differences were particularly prominent, implying profound membrane phase changes during the rehydration-dehydration cycle. In general, this study expands our understanding of the metabolite dynamics in N. flagelliforme and provides biotechnological clues for achieving the efficient production of those metabolites with medical potential.",Antiproliferative Effect of Aminoethyl-Chitooligosaccharide on Human Lung A549 Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109093,Biomolecules,2019 05 21,"The aminoethyl-chitooligosaccharide (AE-COS) was reported to inhibit human gastric cancer cell proliferation and human fibrosarcoma cell invasion.

Moreover, AE-COS treatment caused suppression on COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the role of AE-COS in induction of cell apoptosis was observed via decreasing Bcl-2 expression and increasing caspase-3 and -9 activation. Accordingly, the antiproliferative effect of AE-COS was indicated due to suppression of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis, suggesting AE-COS as a promising chemotherapy agent for treatment of lung cancer.","Dietary Profiles, Nutritional Biochemistry Status, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Path Analysis for a Case-Control Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109092,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 21,"This study aims to investigate dietary and nutritional biochemistry profiles of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to explore their potential relationship by path analysis.

Dietary intake of the participants was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Fasting blood samples were collected to determine the serum levels of multiple nutritional markers. Moreover, we employed a structural equation model (SEM) to link diet, nutritional markers and ADHD. Compared to healthy control, ADHD children had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin B12, folate, vitamin B6, ferritin concentration, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), but higher levels of serum saturated fatty acids (SFA), n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio, and inorganic phosphorous concentration. Children with ADHD had more intake of nutrient-poor foods such as high sugar and high fat foods, and had less intake of vegetable, fruit, protein-rich foods than their counterpart. SEM analysis showed that the poor nutritional biochemistry profiles linked the association between unhealthy dietary patterns and ADHD. In conclusion, an unhealthy dietary pattern may be a predecessor of the poor nutritional biochemistry status, and managing diet and nutrition conditions should be considered to improve ADHD symptoms in children."

However, in India, an informal workforce, lack of structured training facilities and non-implementation of farriery regulations pose challenges for quality farriery. Brooke India, an equine welfare organisation, has undertaken many initiatives aiming to improve farriery services, including technical training and engagement with equid-owning communities. However, this has met with varying success. The study aimed to identify factors that prevent farriers providing quality farriery services. Focus-group discussions were conducted with farriers from two districts of Uttar Pradesh with varying programme outcomes. Within each area, farriers were grouped according to previous level of engagement with Brooke programmes. Demand for services, farrier status, the external environment and technical training and knowledge were identified as key elements that affected farriery work. These factors were very context specific: in areas where brick kilns provided the majority of customers, recent closures had resulted in an increase in those farriers' feeling of insecurity. A systems approach to improving farriery services, taking these factors into account, is advised. Mentoring-based capacity building, which is closely aligned to farrier needs and expectations, is expected to have positive results in terms of technical skill and farrier engagement.",Mechanistic Insights into the Antimicrobial Actions of Metallic Nanoparticles and Their Implications for Multidrug Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109079,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Multiple drug-resistant bacteria are a severe and growing public health concern. Because relatively few antibiotics have been approved over recent years and because of the inability of existing antibiotics to combat bacterial infections fully, demand for unconventional biocides is intense. Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) offer a novel potential means of fighting bacteria. Although metallic NPs exert their effects through membrane protein damage, superoxide radicals and the generation of ions that interfere with the cell granules leading to the formation of condensed particles, their antimicrobial potential, and mechanisms of action are still debated. This article discusses the action of metallic NPs as antibacterial agents, their mechanism of action, and their effect on bacterial drug resistance. Based on encouraging data about the antibacterial effects of NP/antibiotic combinations, we propose that this concept be thoroughly researched to identify means of combating drug-resistant bacteria.",Neuroprotective Effects of Diets Containing Olive Oil and DHA/EPA in a Mouse Model of Cerebral Ischemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109078,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and while there is increasing evidence that a Mediterranean diet might decrease the risk of a stroke, the effects of dietary fat composition on stroke outcomes have not been fully explored. We hypothesize that the brain damage provoked by a stroke would be different depending on the source of dietary fat. To test this, male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 4 weeks with a standard low-fat diet (LFD), a high-fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fatty acids (HFD-SFA), an HFD containing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) from olive oil (HFD-OO), or an HFD containing MUFAs from olive oil plus polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) docosahexaenoic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (DHA/EPA) (HFD-OO-ω3). These mice were then subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo). Behavioural tests and histological analyses were performed 24 and/or 48 h after tMCAo in order to elucidate the impact of these diets with different fatty acid profiles on the ischemic lesion and on neurological functions. Mice fed with HFD-OO-ω3 displayed better histological outcomes after cerebral ischemia than mice that received an HFD-SFA or LFD. Furthermore, PUFA- and MUFA-enriched diets improved the motor function and neurological performance of ischemic mice relative to those fed with an LFD or HFD-SFA. These findings support the use of DHA/EPA-omega-3-fatty acid supplementation and olive oil as dietary source of MUFAs in order to reduce the damage and protect the brain when a stroke occurs.","Optimization of Cation Exchange for the Separation of Actinium-225 from Radioactive Thorium, Radium-223 and Other Metals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109077,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Actinium-225 (225Ac) can be produced with a linear accelerator by proton irradiation of a thorium (Th) target, but the Th also underdoes fission and produces 400 other radioisotopes. No research exists on optimization of the cation step for the purification. The research herein examines the optimization of the cation exchange step for the purification of 225Ac. The following variables were tested: pH of load solution (1.5-4.6); rinse steps with various concentrations of HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, and combinations of HCl and HNO3; various thorium chelators to block retention; MP50 and AG50 resins; and retention of 20-45 elements with different rinse sequences. The research indicated that HCl removes more isotopes earlier than HNO3, but that some elements, such as barium and radium, could be eluted with ≥2.5 M HNO3. The optimal pH of the load solution was 1.5-2.0, and the optimized rinse sequence was five bed volumes (BV) of 1 M citric acid pH 2.0, 3 BV of water, 3 BV of 2 M HNO3, 6 BV of 2.5 M HNO3 and 20 BV of 6 M HNO3.

HEV can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, with the latter usually occurring in immunocompromised patients. Modes of transmission range from the classic fecal-oral route or zoonotic route, to relatively recently recognized but increasingly common routes, such as via the transfusion of blood products or organ transplantation. Extrahepatic manifestations, such as neurological, kidney and hematological abnormalities, have been documented in some limited cases, typically in patients with immune suppression. HEV has demonstrated extensive genomic diversity and a variety of HEV strains have been identified worldwide from human populations as well as growing numbers of animal species. The genetic variability and constant evolution of HEV contribute to its physiopathogenesis and adaptation to new hosts. This review describes the recent classification of the Hepeviridae family, global genotype distribution, clinical significance of HEV genotype and genomic variability and evolution of HEV.","Exploring Public Preferences, Priorities, and Policy Perspectives for Controlling Invasive Mosquito Species in Greece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109075,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 05 21,"Climate change, urbanization, and financial crisis have created a dramatic mixture of challenges in Southern Europe, increasing further the risks of transmission of new vector-borne diseases. In the last decade, there has been a wide spread of an invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito, in various urban ecosystems of Greece accompanied by greater risks of infectious diseases, higher nuisance levels, and increased expenses incurred for their control. The aim of the present paper is to investigate citizens' perception of the Aedes albopictus problem and to evaluate various policy aspects related to its control. Findings are based on the conduct of a web-based survey at a national scale and the production of national surveillance maps. Results indicate that citizens are highly concerned with the health risks associated with the new mosquito species and consider public prevention strategies highly important for the confrontation of the problem while, at the same time, surveillance maps indicate a constant intensification of the problem. The spatial patterns of these results are further investigated aiming to define areas (regions) with different: (a) Levels of risk and/or (b) policy priorities. It appears that citizens are aware of the invasive mosquito problem and appear prone to act against possible consequences. Climate change and the complex socio-ecological context of South Europe are expected to favor a deterioration of the problem and an increasing risk of the transmission of new diseases, posing, in this respect, new challenges for policy makers and citizens.","A Novel lnc-RNA, Named lnc-ORA, Is Identified by RNA-Seq Analysis, and Its Knockdown Inhibits Adipogenesis by Regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109074,Cells,2019 05 21,"Obesity is closely associated with numerous adipogenic regulatory factors, including coding and non-coding genes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a major role in adipogenesis. However, differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) between wild-type (WT) and ob/ob mice, as well as their roles in adipogenesis, are not well understood. Here, a total of 2809 lncRNAs were detected in the iWAT of WT and ob/ob mice by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), including 248 novel lncRNAs. Of them, 46 lncRNAs were expressed differentially in WT and ob/ob mice and were enriched in adipogenesis signaling pathways as determined by KEGG enrichment analysis, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways. Furthermore, we focused on one novel lncRNA, which we named lnc-ORA (obesity-related lncRNA), which had a seven-fold higher expression in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Knockdown of lnc-ORA inhibited preadipocyte proliferation by decreasing the mRNA and protein expression levels of cell cycle markers. Interestingly, lnc-ORA knockdown inhibited adipocyte differentiation by regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, these findings contribute to a better understanding of adipogenesis in relation to lncRNAs and provide novel potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic diseases.",On Providing Multi-Level Quality of Service for Operating Rooms of the Future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109073,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"The Operating Room (OR) plays an important role in delivering vital medical services to patients in hospitals. Such environments contain several medical devices, equipment, and systems producing valuable information which might be combined for biomedical and surgical workflow analysis. Considering the sensibility of data from sensors in the OR, independently of processing and network loads, the middleware that provides data from these sensors have to respect applications quality of service (QoS) demands. In an OR middleware, there are two main bottlenecks that might suffer QoS problems and, consequently, impact directly in user experience: (i) simultaneous user applications connecting the middleware; and (ii) a high number of sensors generating information from the environment. Currently, many middlewares that support QoS have been proposed by many fields; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on this topic or the OR environment. OR environments are characterized by being crowded by persons and equipment, some of them of specific use in such environments, as mobile x-ray machines. Therefore, this article proposes QualiCare, an adaptable middleware model to provide multi-level QoS, improve user experience, and increase hardware utilization to middlewares in OR environments. Our main contributions are a middleware model and an orchestration engine in charge of changing the middleware behavior to guarantee performance. Results demonstrate that adapting middleware parameters on demand reduces network usage and improves resource consumption maintaining data provisioning.",Dietary Flavonoids as Cancer Chemopreventive Agents: An Updated Review of Human Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109072,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Over the past few years, interest in health research has increased, making improved health a global goal for 2030. The purpose of such research is to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing across individuals of all ages. It has been shown that nutrition plays a key role in the prevention of some chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. One of the aspects that characterises a healthy diet is a high intake of vegetables and fruits, as both are flavonoid-rich foods. Flavonoids are one of the main subclasses of dietary polyphenols and possess strong antioxidant activity and anti-carcinogenic properties. Moreover, some population-based studies have described a relationship between cancer risk and dietary flavonoid intake. In this context, the goal of this review was to provide an updated evaluation of the association between the risk of different types of cancers and dietary flavonoid intake. We analysed all relevant epidemiological studies from January 2008 to March 2019 using the PUBMED and Web of Science databases. In summary, this review concludes that dietary flavonoid intake is associated with a reduced risk of different types of cancer, such as gastric, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.",Metabolomics of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109071,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are chronic diseases that affect nearly 425 million people worldwide, leading to poor health outcomes and high health care costs. High-throughput metabolomics screening can provide vital insight into the pathophysiological pathways of DM and help in managing its effects. The primary aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding and management of DM by providing reliable evidence of the relationships between metabolites and type 1 diabetes (T1D) and metabolites and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Information for the study was obtained from the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, and leads to additional articles that were obtained from the reference lists of the studies examined. The results from the selected studies were used to assess the relationships between diabetes (T1D and/or T2D) and metabolite markers-such as glutamine, glycine, and aromatic amino acids-in patients. Seventy studies were selected from the three databases and from the reference lists in the records retrieved. All studies explored associations between various metabolites and T1D or T2D. This review identified several plasma metabolites associated with T2D prediabetes and/or T1D and/or T2D in humans. The evidence shows that metabolites such as glucose, fructose, amino acids, and lipids are typically altered in individuals with T1D and T2D. These metabolites exhibit significant predictive associations with T2D prediabetes, T1D, and/or T2D. The current review suggests that changes in plasma metabolites can be identified by metabolomic techniques and used to identify and analyze T1D and T2D biomarkers. The results of the metabolomic studies can be used to help create effective interventions for managing these diseases."

In this scenario, cancer cells (CCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have important roles. These cellular populations, which come from differentiated cells and progenitor stem cells, have increased metabolic requirements when it comes to maintaining or expanding the tumors, and they serve as links to some inflammatory mediators. Although the molecular mechanisms that are involved in these associations remain unclear, the two following cellular pathways have been suggested: 1) the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) process, which permits the differentiation of adult stem cells throughout the acquisition of cell polarity and the adhesion to epithelia, as well to new cellular lineages (CSCs); and, 2) a reverse process, termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where, in pathophysiological conditions (tissue injury, inflammatory process, and oxidative stress), the differentiated cells can acquire a multipotent stem cell-like phenotype. The molecular mechanisms that regulate both EMT and MET are complex and poorly understood. Especially, in the thyroid gland, little is known regarding MET/EMT and the role of CCs or CSCs, providing an exciting, new area of knowledge to be investigated. This article reviews the progress to date in research on the role of inflammatory mediators and metabolic reprogramming during the carcinogenesis process of the thyroid gland and the EMT pathways.","Maternal Omega-3 Nutrition, Placental Transfer and Fetal Brain Development in Gestational Diabetes and Preeclampsia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109059,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA), are widely recognized to impact fetal and infant neurodevelopment. The impact of DHA on brain development, and its inefficient synthesis from the essential alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), has led to recommended DHA intakes of 250-375 mg eicosapentaenoic acid + DHA/day for pregnant and lactating women by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Despite these recommendations, the intake of omega-3s in women of child-bearing age in the US remains very low. The low maternal status of DHA prior to pregnancy could impair fetal neurodevelopment. This review focuses on maternal omega-3 status in conditions of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia, and the subsequent impact on placental transfer and cord blood concentration of omega-3s. Both GDM and preeclampsia are associated with altered maternal omega-3 status, altered placental omega-3 metabolism, reduced cord blood omega-3 levels and have an impact on neurodevelopment in the infant and on brain health later in life. These findings indicate lower DHA exposure of the developing baby may be driven by lower placental transfer in both conditions. Thus, determining approaches which facilitate increased delivery of DHA during pregnancy and early development might positively impact brain development in infants born to mothers with these diseases.",Determinants of the Stunting of Children Under Two Years Old in Indonesia: A Multilevel Analysis of the 2013 Indonesia Basic Health Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109058,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Indonesia is ranked fifth among countries with the highest burden of stunting in children under five. This study aims to examine the determinants of stunting in children aged 0-2 years in Indonesia using data derived from the 2013 Indonesia Basic Health Survey. Twenty potential predictors of stunting, categorized into household and housing characteristics; maternal and paternal characteristics; antenatal care services and child characteristics were analyzed. Multilevel analyses were performed to examine the role of cluster/district/provincial differences, as well as individual/household level characteristics and stunting status. Of 24,657 children analyzed, 33.7% (95%CI: 32.8%-34.7%) were stunted. The odds of stunting increased significantly among children living in households with three or more children under five-years-old (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.03-1.72), households with five to seven household members (aOR =1.11; 95%CI: 1.03-1.20), children whose mothers during pregnancy attended less than four antenatal care services (aOR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.08-1.39), boys (aOR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.22-1.45), children aged 12-23 months (aOR = 1.89; 95%CI: 1.54-2.32), and children who weighed <2500 g at birth (aOR = 2.55; 95%CI: 2.05-3.15).

This hormone generates sex differences in the development of hypothalamic neuronal circuits controlling neuroendocrine events, feeding, growth, reproduction and behavior. In vitro, estradiol promotes sexually dimorphic effects on hypothalamic neuritogenesis. Previous studies have shown that developmental actions of the phytoestrogen genistein result in permanent sexually dimorphic effects in some behaviors and neural circuits in vivo. In the present study, we have explored if genistein, like estradiol, affects neuritogenesis in primary hypothalamic neurons and investigated the estrogen receptors implicated in this action. Hypothalamic neuronal cultures, obtained from male or female embryonic day 14 (E14) CD1 mice, were treated with genistein (0.1 µM, 0.5 µM or 1 µM) or vehicle. Under basal conditions, female neurons had longer primary neurites, higher number of secondary neurites and higher neuritic arborization compared to male neurons. The treatment with genistein increased neuritic arborization and the number of primary neurites and decreased the number of secondary neurites in female neurons, but not in male neurons. In contrast, genistein resulted in a significant increase in primary neuritic length in male neurons, but not in female neurons. The use of selective estrogen receptor antagonists suggests that estrogen receptor α, estrogen receptor β and G-protein-coupled estrogen receptors are involved in the neuritogenic action of genistein. In summary, these findings indicate that genistein exerts sexually dimorphic actions on the development of hypothalamic neurons, altering the normal pattern of sex differences in neuritogenesis.",Aza-Amino Acids Disrupt β-Sheet Secondary Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109055,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Cα to N substitution in aza-amino acids imposes local conformational constraints, changes in hydrogen bonding properties, and leads to adaptive chirality at the nitrogen atom.

The weighed K-nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithm is one of the most widely used deterministic algorithms. The traditional WKNN algorithm uses Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance between the received signal strengths (RSS) as the distance measure to judge the physical distance between points. However, the relationship between the RSS and the physical distance is nonlinear, using the traditional Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance to measure the physical distance will lead to errors in positioning. In addition, the traditional RSS-based clustering algorithm only takes the signal distance between the RSS as the clustering criterion without considering the position distribution of reference points (RPs). Therefore, to improve the positioning accuracy, we propose an improved WiFi positioning method based on fingerprint clustering and signal weighted Euclidean distance (SWED). The proposed algorithm is tested by experiments conducted in two experimental fields. The results indicate that compared with the traditional methods, the proposed position label-assisted (PL-assisted) clustering result can reflect the position distribution of RPs and the proposed SWED-based WKNN (SWED-WKNN) algorithm can significantly improve the positioning accuracy.",The Blood Pressure Pendulum following Spinal Cord Injury: Implications for Vascular Cognitive Impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109053,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Cognitive impairment following spinal cord injury (SCI) has received considerable attention in recent years. Among the various systemic effects of SCI that contribute towards cognitive decline in this population, cardiovascular dysfunction is arguably one of the most significant. The majority of individuals with a cervical or upper-thoracic SCI commonly experience conditions called orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia, which are characterized by dangerous fluctuations in systemic blood pressure (BP). Herein, we review the potential impact of extreme BP lability on vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in individuals with SCI. Albeit preliminary in the SCI population, there is convincing evidence that chronic hypotension and hypertension in able-bodied individuals results in devastating impairments in cerebrovascular health, leading to VCI. We discuss the pertinent literature, and while drawing mechanistic comparisons between able-bodied cohorts and individuals with SCI, we emphasize the need for additional research to elucidate the mechanisms of cognitive impairment specific to the SCI population. Lastly, we highlight the current and potential future therapies to manage and treat BP instability, thereby possibly mitigating VCI in the SCI population.",Transcriptome and Proteome Profiling of Different Colored Rice Reveals Physiological Dynamics Involved in the Flavonoid Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109052,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Black and red rice are rich in both anthocyanin and proanthocyanin content, which belong to a large class of flavonoids derived from a group of phenolic secondary metabolites. However, the molecular pathways and mechanisms underlying the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway are far from clear. Therefore, this study was undertaken to gain insight into physiological factors that are involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in rice cultivars with red, black, and white colors. RNA sequencing of caryopsis and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analyses have generated a nearly complete catalog of mRNA and expressed proteins in different colored rice cultivars. A total of 31,700 genes were identified, of which 3417, 329, and 227 genes were found specific for red, white, and black rice, respectively. A total of 13,996 unique peptides corresponding to 3916 proteins were detected in the proteomes of black, white, and red rice. Coexpression network analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among the different rice cultivars showed significant differences in photosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Based on a differential enrichment analysis, 32 genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were detected, out of which only CHI, F3H, ANS, and FLS were detected by iTRAQ. Taken together, the results point to differences in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways among different colored rice cultivars, which may reflect differences in physiological functions. The differences in contents and types of flavonoids among the different colored rice cultivars are related to changes in base sequences of Os06G0162500, Os09G0455500, Os09G0455500, and Os10G0536400. Current findings expand and deepen our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis and concurrently provides potential candidate genes for improving the nutritional qualities of rice.","Pride, Love, and Twitter Rants: Combining Machine Learning and Qualitative Techniques to Understand What Our Tweets Reveal about Race in the US.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109051,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Objective: Describe variation in sentiment of tweets using race-related terms and identify themes characterizing the social climate related to race. Methods: We applied a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier to conduct sentiment analysis of 1,249,653 US tweets using race-related terms from 2015-2016. To evaluate accuracy, manual labels were compared against computer labels for a random subset of 6600 tweets. We conducted qualitative content analysis on a random sample of 2100 tweets. Results: Agreement between computer labels and manual labels was 74%. Tweets referencing Middle Eastern groups (12.5%) or Blacks (13.8%) had the lowest positive sentiment compared to tweets referencing Asians (17.7%) and Hispanics (17.5%). Qualitative content analysis revealed most tweets were represented by the categories: negative sentiment (45%), positive sentiment such as pride in culture (25%), and navigating relationships (15%). While all tweets use one or more race-related terms, negative sentiment tweets which were not derogatory or whose central topic was not about race were common. Conclusion: This study harnesses relatively untapped social media data to develop a novel area-level measure of social context (sentiment scores) and highlights some of the challenges in doing this work. New approaches to measuring the social environment may enhance research on social context and health."

As sustainable development can only be achieved by reducing energy intensity, new energy and renewable energy investment, as well as improving traditional energy efficiency, is becoming increasingly important. However, past energy efficiency assessments using data envelopment analysis (DEA) models mostly focused on radial and non-radial DEA model analyses. However, traditional radial DEA models ignore non-radial slacks when evaluating efficiency values, and non-radial DEA models ignore the same proportionality as radial DEA when evaluating efficiency value slacks. To balance the radial and non-radial model characteristics and consider undesirable output, this study combines a modified Epsilou-based measure (EBM) DEA and undesirable output and proposes a modified undesirable EBM DEA model to analyze the efficiency of China's new and traditional energy sources. The empirical results found that (1) most new energy investment in most municipalities/provinces rapidly grew from 2013 to 2016; (2) as the annual efficiency score was only 1 in Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the other 26 municipalities/provinces need significant improvements; (3) traditional energy efficiency scores were higher than new energy efficiency; and (4) NO2 efficiencies are slightly better than CO2 and SO2 efficiencies.",pH-Sensitive Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Evaluation of Tumor Treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109039,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Determining therapeutic efficacy is critical for tumor precision theranostics. In order to monitor the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs (e.g., Paclitaxel), a pH-sensitive ratiometric fluorescent imaging probe was constructed. The pH-sensitive ratiometric fluorescent dye ANNA was covalently coupled to the N-terminal of the cell-penetrating TAT peptide through an amidation reaction (TAT-ANNA). The in vitro cellular experiments determined that the TAT-ANNA probe could penetrate the cell membrane and image the intracellular pH in real time. The in vivo experiments were then carried out, and the ratiometric pH response to the state of the tumor was recorded immediately after medication. The TAT-ANNA probe was successfully used to monitor the pharmacodynamics of anti-cancer drugs in vivo.","What If Your Husband Doesn't Feel the Pressure? An Exploration of Women's Involvement in WaSH Decision Making in Nyanchwa, Kenya.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109038,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"Access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Women and girls suffer the main burden of a lack of access to WaSH because they are primarily responsible for collecting water for their homes. However, they are often excluded from WaSH decision-making and implementation processes. This research sought to explore women's experiences in participating in WaSH decision-making through a case study in Nyanchwa, Kenya. Twelve (12) key informant interviews were conducted with community leaders and members regarding challenges and possible measures for enhancing women and girls' participation in WaSH decision-making. From this research, it is evident that economic challenges and cultural factors such as male dominance, greatly inhibit women and girls' participation in WaSH decision-making and implementation processes. Other factors such as time constraints and low literacy rates also emerged. The paper concludes with a call for collaboration among women's groups to enhance collective action for improved access to WaSH. This will undoubtedly lead to enhanced community health and wellbeing (Sustainable Development Goal 3, SDG3) through the empowerment of women (Sustainable Development Goal 5, SDG5).","Exploiting Plasma Exposed, Natural Surface Nanostructures in Ramie Fibers for Polymer Composite Applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109037,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Nanoscale surface morphology of plant fibers has important implications for the interfacial bonding in fiber-polymer composites. In this study, we investigated and quantified the effect of plasma-surface modification on ramie plant fibers as a potential tool for simple and efficient surface modification. The extensive investigation of the effects of plasma treatment of the fiber surface nano-morphology and its effect on the fiber-polymer interface was performed by Low-Voltages Scanning Electron Microscopy (LV-SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis, fiber-resin angle measurements and mechanical (tensile) testing. The LV-SEM imaging of uncoated plasma treated fibers reveals nanostructures such as microfibrils and elementary fibrils and their importance for fiber mechanical properties, fiber wettability, and fiber-polymer matrix interlocking which all peak at short plasma treatment times. Thus, such treatment can be an effective in modifying the fiber surface characteristics and fiber-polymer matrix interlocking favorably for composite applications.",All You Need to Know about the Kinetics of Thermally Stimulated Reactions Occurring on Cooling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109036,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"In this tutorial overview article the authors share their original experience in studying the kinetics of thermally stimulated reactions under the conditions of continuous cooling. It is stressed that the kinetics measured on heating is similar to that measured on cooling only for single-step reactions. For multi-step reactions the respective kinetics can differ dramatically. The application of an isoconversional method to thermogravimetry (TGA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data allows one to recognize multi-step kinetics in the form of the activation energy that varies with conversion. Authors' argument is supported by theoretical considerations as well as by experimental examples that include the reactions of thermal decomposition and crosslinking polymerization (curing). The observed differences in the kinetics measured on heating and cooling ultimately manifest themselves in the Arrhenius plots of the opposite curvatures, which means that the heating kinetics cannot be used to predict the kinetics on cooling. The article provides important background knowledge necessary for conducting successful kinetic studies on cooling. It includes a practical advice on optimizing the parameters of cooling experiments as well as on proper usage of kinetic methods for analysis of obtained data.",Impact of Different Gums on Textural and Microbial Properties of Goat Milk Yogurts during Refrigerated Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109035,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"In this study, the impact of seven different gums on textural and microbiological properties of goat milk yogurt during refrigerated storage was investigated. The results showed that yogurt containing xanthan and locust bean gums had enhanced firmness, consistency, cohesiveness, and viscosity during four weeks of storage compared to the control and yogurt fortified with other gums (p < 0.05). The addition of gums also helped to maintain the microbial viability of the yogurt culture and the probiotic Bifidobacterium spp. This study thus demonstrated that these gums could be used in the production of goat milk yogurt with enhanced textural properties.",Carbon Dot-Mediated Capillary Electrophoresis Separations of Metallated and Demetallated Forms of Transferrin Protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109034,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Carbon dots (CDs) are fluorescent nanomaterials used extensively in bioimaging, biosensing and biomedicine. This is due in large part to their biocompatibility, photostability, lower toxicity, and lower cost, compared to inorganic quantum dots or organic dyes. However, little is known about the utility of CDs as separation adjuvants in capillary electrophoresis (CE) separations. CDs were synthesized in-house according to a 'bottom-up' method from citric acid or other simple carbon precursors. To demonstrate the applicability of CDs as separation adjuvants, mixtures of holo- (metallated) and apo- (demetallated) forms of transferrin (Tf, an iron transport protein) were analyzed. In the absence of CDs, the proteins were not resolved by a simple CE method; however, upon addition of CDs to the separation buffer, multiple forms of Tf were resolved indicating that CDs are valuable tools to facilitate the separation of analytes by CE. CE parameters including sample preparation, buffer identity, ionic strength, pH, capillary inside diameter, and temperature were optimized. The results suggest that dots synthesized from citric acid provide the best resolution of various different forms of Tf and that CDs are versatile and promising tools to improve current electrophoretic separation methods, especially for metalloprotein analysis.","The Prevalence of Smoking, Determinants and Chance of Psychological Problems among Smokers in an Urban Community Housing Project in Malaysia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109033,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"Objective: This study was conducted to assess the prevalence, pattern of smoking and sociodemographic factors among Kerinchi residents in Kuala Lumpur, as well as to identify the association between smoking, stress, anxiety and depression. Methods: This study was carried out at four community housing projects in the Lembah Pantai area in Kuala Lumpur. Data was collected between 3 February 2012, and 29 November 2012. Data collectors made house visits and used interviewer administered questionnaires containing questions on demographic data and smoking patterns. Depression anxiety stress scale (DASS) was used to assess psychological symptoms. Alcohol smoking and substance involvement screening tool (ASSIST) scale was used to assess nicotine use. Results: Data from 1989 individuals (833 households) showed the age of respondents ranged from 18 to 89 years and the mean age was 39.12 years. There were 316 smokers indicating the prevalence of smoking was 15.85%, with 35.5% among males and 1.8% among females. Further, 86.6% of smokers were Malay and 87% were Muslims. Divorce was associated with smoking. Unemployment and housewives were less associated with smoking. Depression and anxiety were significantly associated with smoking (OR = 1.347. 95% CI: 1.042-1.741) and (OR = 1.401. 95% CI: 1.095-1.793) respectively.

Thirty-seven participants from the AG, 29 from the NAG, and 31 adults without ID participated in this study. Height and weight were obtained to calculate body mass index (BMI). PA levels and ST were assessed with GT3X Actigraph accelerometers for 7 days. Results revealed that the AG engaged in higher values of moderate to vigorous PA compared with the NAG (all p < 0.05), but were similar to adults without ID. Adults without ID performed less ST and more light PA than the ID groups (all p < 0.05). The participants of the AG did not demonstrate less ST than the NAG. It is concerning that adults with ID (AG or NAG) are spending a higher time in ST and less time in light PA than adults without ID. Our results suggest that integrated, well-designed PA programmes into the ID population workdays can lead to increased PA levels. Nevertheless, these interventions and exercise programmes implemented for adults with ID should be tailored to also reduce ST.",Debonding Damage Detection in CFRP Plate-Strengthened Steel Beam Using Electromechanical Impedance Technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109030,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer materials are widely applied in structure strengthened engineering because of the many advantages of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. However, the debonding damage between the carbon fiber reinforced polymer and host structures occurs frequently, which might lead to the brittle failure of structure components, especially flexural ones. In this paper, an electromechanical impedance-based method, an important technique in structural health monitoring, was adopted to detect the debonding damage of carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate-strengthened steel beam by using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers. A carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate-strengthened steel beam specimen was fabricated in the laboratory and two PZT sensors were attached at different locations on the carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate. The impedance signatures with variation of the different degrees of the debonding damage were measured by an impedance analyzer. The root-mean-square deviation method and the cross-correlation coefficient method were used to quantify the correlation between the electromechanical impedance and the debonding damage degree. The results reflect that an electromechanical impedance-based structural health monitoring technique can serve as a good method to detect the debonding damage of carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate-strengthened steel structures."

Diagnosis relies on clinical recognition of the syndrome and confirming inflammation through imaging and/or laboratory studies. Acute treatment is targeted at decreasing immune-mediated injury, and chronic preventative therapy may be indicated if TM is determined to be a manifestation of a relapsing disorder (i.e., NMOSD).

Mangiferin is a natural glucosylxanthone with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which has been confirmed to protect cardiac cells from myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI); however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. As oxidative stress is a major pathogenesis of MIRI, an H9C2 cell injury induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was established to simulate MIRI in vitro. Herein, the protective effect of mangiferin against MIRI was evaluated and the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics was applied to explore the underlying molecular mechanism. In this research, mangiferin markedly ameliorated the oxidative imbalance by increasing the antioxidative capacity of the H9C2 cell. Moreover, proteomics analysis revealed that mangiferin pretreatment brought twenty differently-expressed proteins back to normal, most of which were related to glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Glycolysis, citrate cycle, and fatty acid degradation pathways were highlighted by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Western blot validation of six cardiac metabolism-related proteins were consistent with the proteomics analysis. Taken together, mangiferin protected the cardiomyocytes from MIRI by enhancing the antioxidant capacity and increasing the activities of glycolysis, citrate cycle, and fatty acid degradation pathways.",Observing the Viscous Relaxation Process of Silica Optical Fiber at ~1000 °C Using Regenerated Fiber Bragg Grating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109014,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"A regenerated fiber Bragg grating (RFBG) in silica fiber was used to observe the viscous relaxation process of the host silica fiber at high temperatures of around 1000 °C. Two factors, preannealing time and loaded tension, which affect viscous relaxation, were observed. When an RFBG is stretched after a longer preannealing, the measured viscosity of the optical fiber was observed to reach equilibrium faster, which means that preannealing accelerates viscous relaxation. A similar acceleration phenomenon was also observed when a larger load was applied to stretch the optical fiber, although the acceleration effect of loaded tension was not as strong as in the preannealing case. The results play an active role in establishing effective optical-fiber devices for application in high-temperature environments.",Chinese White Wax Solid Lipid Nanoparticles as a Novel Nanocarrier of Curcumin for Inhibiting the Formation of Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109013,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Chinese white wax solid lipid nanoparticles (cwSLNs) were prepared by high shear homogenization and ultrasound methods.

The curcumin loaded cwSLNs (Cur-cwSLNs) exhibited sustained drug release properties. Notably, Cur-cwSLNs had a higher drug release rate at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.4, which suggested their applicability in an acidic environment. Cur-cwSLNs were able to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and were more effective at reducing the biofilms produced by this bacterium compared to free curcumin.

This treatment in combination with square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SW-ASV) with solid gold electrodes (SGE) and gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrodes (AuNPs-GCE) was applied for the determination of total mercury content. A certified reference material (CRM, Tuna Fish BCR 463), ten freeze-dried samples of canned tuna and two fresh fish samples were analysed both with a bench-top voltammetric analyser after microwave digestion and with a portable potentiostat after mild eating using a small commercial food warmer. The results obtained by the two SW-ASV approaches and by a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA), the official method for mercury determination, were in very good agreement. In particular, (i) the results obtained with in field procedure are consistent with those obtained with the conventional microwave digestion; (ii) the presence of gold nanoparticles on the active electrode surface permits an improvement of the analytical performance in comparison to the SGE: the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) for mercury in fish-matrix was 0.1 μg L-1 (Hg cell concentration), corresponding to 0.06 mg kg-1 wet fish, which is a performance comparable to that of DMA. The pretreatment proposed in this study is very easy and applicable to fresh fish; in combination with a portable potentiostat, it proved to be an interesting procedure for on-site mercury determination.",The Multi-Purpose Airborne Sensor Carrier MASC-3 for Wind and Turbulence Measurements in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109010,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"For atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) studies, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can provide new information in addition to traditional in-situ measurements, or by ground- or satellite-based remote sensing techniques. The ability of fixed-wing UAS to transect the ABL in short time supplement ground-based measurements and the ability to extent the data horizontally and vertically allows manifold investigations. Thus, the measurements can provide many new possibilities for investigating the ABL. This study presents the new mark of the Multi-Purpose Airborne Sensor Carrier (MASC-3) for wind and turbulence measurements and describes the subsystems designed to improve the wind measurement, to gain endurance and to allow operations under an enlarged range of environmental conditions. The airframe, the capabilities of the autopilot Pixhawk 2.1, the sensor system and the data acquisition software, as well as the post-processing software, provide the basis for flight experiments and are described in detail. Two flights in a stable boundary-layer and a close comparison to a measurement tower and a Sodar system depict the accuracy of the wind speed and direction measurements, as well as the turbulence measurements. Mean values, variances, covariance, turbulent kinetic energy and the integral length scale agree well with measurements from a meteorological measurement tower. MASC-3 performs valuable measurements of stable boundary layers with high temporal resolution and supplements the measurements of meteorological towers and sodar systems.",Role of Integrins in Resistance to Therapies Targeting Growth Factor Receptors in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109009,Cancers,2019 05 21,"Integrins contribute to cancer progression and aggressiveness by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways and transducing mechanical tension forces. Remarkably, these adhesion receptors share common signaling networks with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and support their oncogenic activity, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival and invasion. During the last decade, preclinical studies have revealed that integrins play an important role in resistance to therapies targeting RTKs and their downstream pathways. A remarkable feature of integrins is their wide-ranging interconnection with RTKs, which helps cancer cells to adapt and better survive therapeutic treatments. In this context, we should consider not only the integrins expressed in cancer cells but also those expressed in stromal cells, since these can mechanically increase the rigidity of the tumor microenvironment and confer resistance to treatment. This review presents some of these mechanisms and outlines new treatment options for improving the efficacy of therapies targeting RTK signaling."

Using pancreatic carcinoma cells, we show that both KD and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of RAC1B increased the expression of the TGF-β type I receptor ALK5 (activin receptor-like kinase 5), but this effect was more pronounced in CRISPR-KO cells. Of note, in KO, but not KD cells, ALK5 upregulation was associated with resensitization of TGFBR1 to induction by TGF-β1 stimulation. RAC1B KO also increased TGF-β1-induced C-terminal SMAD3 phosphorylation, SMAD3 transcriptional activity, growth inhibition, and cell migration. The KD of ALK5 expression by RNA interference or inactivation of the ALK5 kinase activity by dominant-negative interference or ATP-competitive inhibition rescued the cells from the RAC1B KD/KO-mediated increase in TGF-β1-induced cell migration, whereas the ectopic expression of kinase-active ALK5 mimicked this RAC1B KD/KO effect. We conclude that RAC1B downregulates the abundance of ALK5 and SMAD3 signaling, thereby attenuating TGF-β/SMAD3-driven cellular responses, such as growth inhibition and cell motility.","Effects of Cariprazine, Aripiprazole, and Olanzapine on Mouse Fibroblast Culture: Changes in Adiponectin Contents in Supernatants, Triglyceride Accumulation, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ Expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108997,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 21,"Background and Objectives: The use of the dopamine-partial agonist subclass (also termed dopamine stabilizers) of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of negative schizophrenia symptoms and some mood disorders has increased recently. Similar to other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), aripiprazole (ARI) and cariprazine (CAR) also influence food intake, but the peripheral effects of these drugs on adipose-tissue homeostasis, including adipokine secretion as well as lipo- and adipogenesis, are not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the adipocyte-related mechanisms induced by second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), leading to changes in peripheral signals involved in energy homeostasis. Materials and Methods: CAR, a new SGA, was compared with ARI and olanzapine (OLA), using cell cultures to study adipogenesis, and the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) was measured in adipocytes derived from mouse fibroblasts, by western blotting on days 7, 14, and 21 postinduction. The triglyceride (TG) content of the cells was also evaluated on day 15 using Oil Red O staining, and the adiponectin (AN) content in the cell culture supernatants was quantified on days 7 and 15 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cells were treated with two concentrations of ARI (0.5 and 20 µg/mL), OLA (1 and 20 µg/mL), and CAR (0.1 and 2 µg/mL). Results: Both concentrations of ARI and OLA, as well as the lower concentration of CAR, significantly increased the TG contents. The AN levels in the supernatants were significantly increased by the higher concentration of ARI on days 7 and 15 (p < 0.05). Although PPAR-γ levels were not significantly affected by ARI and OLA, the lower concentration of CAR induced a significant time-dependent decrease in PPAR-γ expression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The in vitro adipogenesis considered from TG accumulation, AN secretion, and PPAR-γ expression was differently influenced by ARI, CAR, and OLA. Understanding the adipocyte-related mechanisms of antipsychotics could contribute to understanding their weight-influencing effect.",An Innovative High-Precision Scheme for a GPS/MEMS-SINS Ultra-Tight Integrated System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108996,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"The Doppler-assisted error provided by a low-precision microelectromechanical system (MEMS) strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) increases rapidly. Therefore, the bandwidth of the tracking loop for a global positioning system (GPS)/MEMS-SINS ultra-tight integration system is too narrow to track Doppler shift. GPS measurement error is correlated with the MEMS-SINS velocity error when the Doppler-assisted error exists, leading to tracking loop lock loss. The estimated precision of the integrated Kalman filter (IKF) also decreases. Even the integrated system becomes unstable. To solve this problem, an innovative GPS/MEMS-SINS ultra-tight integration scheme based on using high-precision carrier phase measurements as the IKF measurements is proposed in this study. By assisting the tracking loop with time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) velocity, the carrier loop noise bandwidth and code correlator spacing are reduced. The tracking accuracies of the carrier and code are increased. The navigation accuracy of GPS/MEMS-SINS ultra-tight integration is further improved.",δ-Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with an Optimal Kernel-Based Particle Filtering Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108994,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"Under realistic environmental conditions, heuristic-based data association and map management routines often result in divergent map and trajectory estimates in robotic Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). To address these issues, SLAM solutions have been proposed based on the Random Finite Set (RFS) framework, which models the map and measurements such that the usual requirements of external data association routines and map management heuristics can be circumvented and realistic sensor detection uncertainty can be taken into account. Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)-based RFS SLAM solutions have been demonstrated using the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter and subsequently the Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter. In multi-target tracking, the LMB filter, which was introduced as an efficient approximation to the computationally expensive δ -Generalized LMB ( δ -GLMB) filter, converts its representation of an LMB distribution to δ -GLMB form during the measurement update step. This not only results in a loss of information yielding inferior results (compared to the δ -GLMB filter) but also fails to take computational advantages in parallelized implementations possible with RBPF-based SLAM algorithms. Similar to state-of-the-art random vector-valued RBPF solutions such as FastSLAM and MH-FastSLAM, the performances of all RBPF-based SLAM algorithms based on the RFS framework also diverge from ground truth over time due to random sampling approaches, which only rely on control noise variance. Further, the methods lose particle diversity and diverge over time as a result of particle degeneracy. To alleviate this problem and further improve the quality of map estimates, a SLAM solution using an optimal kernel-based particle filter combined with an efficient variant of the δ -GLMB filter ( δ -GLMB-SLAM) is presented. The performance of the proposed δ -GLMB-SLAM algorithm, referred to as δ -GLMB-SLAM2.0, was demonstrated using simulated datasets and a section of the publicly available KITTI dataset. The results suggest that even with a limited number of particles, δ -GLMB-SLAM2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art RBPF-based RFS SLAM algorithms.",Fabrication and Characteristic of a Double Piezoelectric Layer Acceleration Sensor Based on Li-Doped ZnO Thin Film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108993,Micromachines,2019 05 21,"In this paper, a double piezoelectric layer acceleration sensor based on Li-doped ZnO (LZO) thin film is presented. It is constituted by Pt/LZO/Pt/LZO/Pt/Ti functional layers and a Si cantilever beam with a proof mass. The LZO thin films were prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The composition, chemical structure, surface morphology, and thickness of the LZO thin film were analyzed. In order to study the effect of double piezoelectric layers on the sensitivity of the acceleration sensor, we designed two structural models (single and double piezoelectric layers) and fabricated them by using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology. The test results show that the resonance frequency of the acceleration sensor was 1363 Hz. The sensitivity of the double piezoelectric layer was 33.1 mV/g, which is higher than the 26.1 mV/g of single piezoelectric layer sensitivity, both at a resonance frequency of 1363 Hz.",Current Pattern of Psychiatric Comorbidity and Psychotropic Drug Prescription in Child and Adolescent Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108992,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 21,"Background: In recent years, patterns of the use of psychotropic drugs vary with increasing rates of psychiatric presentation and diagnosis in children and adolescents. Purpose: In this study, we aimed to investigate distributions of current psychiatric symptoms and diagnosis, patterns of the use of psychotropic drugs, and differences according to age and gender in patients presented to a child and adolescent outpatient clinic. Methods: All patients aged between 0 and 18 years presenting to a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic between November 1, 2017 and November 1, 2018 were included in the study. Files of all patients were examined in detail, and patients' demographic characteristics, symptoms, psychiatric diagnoses established according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), psychotropic drugs initiated, and side effect profiles were recorded. Psychiatric symptoms and diagnostic features of the patients were determined, and the differences were investigated according to gender. Clinical characteristics were compared between diagnosed and undiagnosed patients, and between patients with and without drug initiation. Results: Of the 2066 patients, 1298 (62.8%) were male and the mean age was 10.14 ± 4.42 years. The most common symptoms were hyperactivity (23.8%) and inattention (21.6%) in males, inattention (15.1%) and irritability (14.2%) in females, and 79% of the patients received one or more psychiatric diagnoses. The most common psychiatric diagnoses in both genders were attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning disorder (SLD), and conduct disorder, respectively. Of the patients who received a psychiatric diagnosis, 61.8% were using psychotropic drugs, with the majority of them (71.3%) receiving monotherapy. The most frequently initiated drugs included psychostimulants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, with 28.7% of the drug user patients receiving multiple drug therapy. Conclusion: Our study indicates that rate of presentation to child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinics is increasing, and rates of diagnosis and initiation of psychiatry drugs are high among the presented children. The prevalence of ADHD shows an increase in males and females in our country, and psychiatric polypharmacy has reached significant rates.",Spin-Selected Dual-Wavelength Plasmonic Metalenses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108990,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Several novel spin-selected dual-wavelength metalenses have been proposed and investigated based on the plasmonic metasurface consisting of two kinds of rotary rectangle gap nanoantennas (RGN), which are designed based on merging two or four polarity-inverse lenses corresponding to different wavelengths (765 and 1300 nm). The spin-selected dual-wavelength metalenses with two similar and two different vertical and lateral focal points have also been proposed respectively, which can focus two wavelengths with inverse spin states to arbitrary special positions. The three-dimensional metalens with four focal points have also been proposed, which can focus four beams with inverse spin states and different wavelengths to preset positions. Moreover, a spin-dependent achromatic metalens has also been proposed, which can focus left circularly polarized (LCP) incidence with different wavelengths to the same position. Our work opens up new avenues toward establishing novel spin-selected and wavelength-selected metadevices, and is significant for the development of spin-controlled photonics and particles manipulation. In addition, it provides a new idea for solving the problem of data transmission from optical fiber communication to visible light communication.",Optimal Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) Cut-Offs: A Cross-Sectional Study in the Czech Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108989,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 21,"Background and Objectives: The key pathogenetic mechanism of glucose metabolism disorders, insulin resistance (IR), can be assessed using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of IR (HOMA-IR). However, its application in clinical practice is limited due to the absence of cut-offs. In this study, we aimed to define the cut-offs for the Czech population. Methods: After undergoing anthropometric and biochemical studies, the sample of 3539 individuals was divided into either nondiabetics, including both subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 1947) and prediabetics (n = 1459), or diabetics (n = 133). The optimal HOMA-IR cut-offs between subgroups were determined to maximize the sum of the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or prediabetes. The predictive accuracy was illustrated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Logistic regression was performed to assess the association between a target variable (presence/absence of T2DM) depending on the HOMA-IR score as well as on the age and sex. Results: The HOMA-IR cut-off between nondiabetics and diabetics for both sexes together was 3.63, with a sensitivity of 0.56 and a specificity of 0.86. The area under the ROC curve was 0.73 for T2DM diagnosing in both sexes. The HOMA-IR cut-off between the NGT subjects and prediabetics was 1.82, with a sensitivity of 0.60 and a specificity of 0.66. Logistic regression showed that increased HOMA-IR is a risk factor for the presence of T2DM (odds ratio (OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.28, p < 0.0001). The predictive ability of HOMA-IR in diagnosing T2DM is statistically significantly lower in females (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.98). The results are valid for middle-aged European adults. Conclusions: The results suggest the existence of HOMA-IR cut-offs signaling established IR. Introduction of the instrument into common clinical practice, together with the known cut-offs, may contribute to preventing T2DM.",Frequency and Quantity of Egg Intake Is Not Associated with Dyslipidemia: The Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey (HNNHS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108988,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Gaps remain on the safety of egg intake on cardiovascular health, setting the study's aim to investigate the association between quantity and frequency of egg consumption, with established dyslipidemia.",Temperature Effects during Impact Testing of a Two-Phase Metal-Ceramic Composite Material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108987,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Metal-ceramic composite (MCC) materials can be used for manufacturing high-responsibility structures such as jet engines or cutting tools. One example of these materials is a two-phase wolfram carbide (WC) and cobalt (Co) composite. This MCC is a combination of hard WC grains with a Co metallic ductile binder. The resulting microstructure is a combination of two phases with significantly different mechanical behaviors. In this study, we investigate impact conditions, starting with an illustrative example of the Taylor impact bar where-although the process is very rapid-the equivalent plastic strain and temperature are higher in the adiabatic solution than those in the coupled solution. On exposing the WC/Co composite with a metallic binder to impact loading, heat is generated by plastic deformation. If the process is fast enough, the problem can be treated as adiabatic. However, a more common situation is that the process is slower, and the heat is generated in the ductile metallic binders. As a result, the associated grains are heated due to the conduction effect. Consequently, the process should be treated as coupled. When the impact is applied over a short time period, maximum temperatures are significantly lower if the process is analyzed as coupled rather than as adiabatic. The grains are immediately affected by temperature increase in the binders. Therefore, the heat conduction effect should not be omitted."

The system was used in eight health care facilities sites during 30 cardiac and orthopedic surgery interventions. A total of 119 h of data were recorded and analyzed. Three hundred thirty four individual displacements were reconstructed. On average, only 10.6% individual positions could not be reconstructed and were considered undetermined, i.e., the presence in the room of the corresponding staff member could not be determined.

Therefore, improving salinity tolerance of chrysanthemum has become an important research direction in tolerance breeding. Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is an evolutionarily highly conserved transcriptional co-activator in archaea and eukaryotes and has been reported to play important roles to respond to abiotic stresses. Here, a MBF1 gene induced by salt stress was isolated and functionally characterized from Dendranthema grandiflorum and name as DgMBF1. Overexpression of DgMBF1 in chrysanthemum increased the tolerance of plants to high salt stress compared to wild type (WT). It also showed fewer accumulations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2-), higher activities of antioxidant enzymes, more content of proline and soluble sugar (SS) and more favorable K+/Na+ ratio than those of WT under salt stress. In addition, the expression level of genes related to antioxidant biosynthesis, proline biosynthesis, glyco-metabolism and K+/Na+ homeostasis was statistically significant higher in the DgMBF1-overexpressed lines than that in WT. These results demonstrated that DgMBF1 is a positive regulator in response to salt stress and could serve as a new candidate gene for salt-tolerant plant breeding.",Target-Guided Isolation of Three Main Antioxidants from Mahonia bealei (Fort.)

However, methods of the systematic purification of antioxidants from M. bealei are lacking. In this study, antioxidants from this plant were effectively and rapidly enriched. First, antioxidants were screened using online 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical (DPPH)-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), followed by separation using high-speed countercurrent chromatography with an optical solvent system composed of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (1:5:1:5, v/v/v/v). Three phenolics-chlorogenic acid (1, 8.3 mg), quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (2, 20.5 mg), and isorhamnetin-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (3, 28.4 mg)-were obtained from the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (240 mg) by one-step separation. The chemical structures of the phenolics were characterized by MS and NMR techniques, and the purity of each compound was >92.0% as determined by HPLC. The isolated compounds were assessed by scavenging activities on DPPH and superoxide radicals as well as cytoprotective assays, all of which showed similar trends regarding the antioxidant capacities of the compounds. Moreover, compounds 1-3 significantly attenuated the lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in H2O2-treated RAW264.7 cells.

There are several markers of renal hypoperfusion which are used in the differential diagnosis of acute kidney failure. Albuminuria is observed after almost any exercise. The aim of this study was to assess changes in renal hypoperfusion and albuminuria after a 100-km race. Materials and Methods: A total of 27 males who finished a 100-km run were studied. The mean age of the runners was 38.04 ± 5.64 years. The exclusion criteria were a history of kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 ml/min, and proteinuria. Blood and urine were collected before and after the race. The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea) and sodium (FeNa), plasma urea/creatinine ratio (sUrea/Cr), urine/plasma creatinine ratio (u/pCr), urinary sodium to potassium ratio (uNa/K), and urinary potassium to urinary potassium plus sodium ratio (uK/(K+Na)) were calculated. Results: After the race, significant changes in albuminuria and markers of renal hypoperfusion (FeNa, FeUrea, sUrea/Cr, u/sCr, urinary Na, uNa/K, uK/(K+Na)) were found. Fifteen runners (55.56%) had severe renal hypoperfusion (FeUrea <35, uNa/K <1, and uK/(Na+K) >0.5) after the race. The mean ACR increased from 6.28 ± 3.84 mg/g to 48.43 ± 51.64 mg/g (p < 0.001). The ACR was higher in the group with severe renal hypoperfusion (59.42 ± 59.86 vs. 34.68 ± 37.04 mg/g), but without statistical significance. Conclusions: More than 50% of the runners had severe renal hypoperfusion after extreme exercise.

The photonic nanoarchitectures responsible for the coloration of the wing scales of many butterfly species possessing structural color exhibit chemical selectivity, i.e., give vapor-specific optical response signals. Modeling this complex physical-chemical process is very important to be able to exploit the possibilities of these photonic nanoarchitectures. We performed measurements of the ethanol vapor concentration-dependent reflectance spectra of the Albulina metallica butterfly, which exhibits structural color on both the dorsal (blue) and ventral (gold-green) wing sides. Using a numerical analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, we revealed the details of the photonic nanoarchitecture inside the wing scales. On both sides, it is a 1D + 2D structure, a stack of layers, where the layers contain a quasi-ordered arrangement of air voids embedded in chitin. Next, we built a parametric simulation model that matched the measured spectra. The reflectance spectra were calculated by ab-initio methods by assuming variable amounts of vapor condensed to liquid in the air voids, as well as vapor concentration-dependent swelling of the chitin. From fitting the simulated results to the measured spectra, we found a similar swelling on both wing surfaces, but more liquid was found to concentrate in the smaller air voids for each vapor concentration value measured.",Ultracompact Multielectrode Array for Neurological Monitoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108970,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Patients with paralysis, spinal cord injury, or amputated limbs could benefit from using brain-machine interface technology for communication and neurorehabilitation.

A novel microassembly technique involving lead transfer was used to prevent misalignment in the bonding plane during the orthogonal assembly of the 3D multielectrode probe array. Standard microassembly and biopackaging processes were utilized to implement the proposed lead transfer technique. The maximum profile of the integrated 3D neural device was set to 0.50 mm above the pia mater to reduce trauma to brain cells. Benchtop tests characterized the electrical impedance of the neural device. A characterization test revealed that the impedance of the 3D multielectrode probe array was on average approximately 0.55 MΩ at a frequency of 1 KHz. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity tests verified the biocompatibility of the device. Subsequently, 3D multielectrode probe arrays were implanted in rats and exhibited the capability to record local field potentials and spike signals.","Arnicolide D, from the herb Centipeda minima, Is a Therapeutic Candidate against Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108969,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a high morbidity and mortality cancer with an obvious racial and geographic bias, particularly endemic to Southeast China. Our previous studies demonstrated that Centipeda minima extract (CME) exhibited anti-cancer effects in human NPC cell lines. Arnicolide C and arnicolide D are sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Centipeda minima. In this study, for the first time, we investigated their anti-NPC effects and further explored the related molecular mechanisms. The effects of both arnicolide C and arnicolide D were tested in NPC cells CNE-1, CNE-2, SUNE-1, HONE1, and C666-1. The results showed that the two compounds inhibited NPC cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. As the inhibitory effect of arnicolide D was the more pronounced of the two, our following studies focused on this compound. Arnicolide D could induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M, and induce cell apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction was investigated, and the results showed that arnicolide D could downregulate cyclin D3, cdc2, p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-STAT3, and upregulate cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 9, and Bax. Regulation of cyclin B1, cdk6, and Bcl-2 expression by arnicolide D showed dynamic changes according to dose and time. Taken together, arnicolide D modulated the cell cycle, activated the caspase signaling pathway, and inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and STAT3 signaling pathways. These findings provide a solid base of evidence for arnicolide D as a lead compound for further development, and act as proof for the viability of drug development from traditional Chinese medicines.",Melatonin MT1 and MT2 Receptors Exhibit Distinct Effects in the Modulation of Body Temperature across the Light/Dark Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108968,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Melatonin (MLT) is a neurohormone that regulates many physiological functions including sleep, pain, thermoregulation, and circadian rhythms. MLT acts mainly through two G-protein-coupled receptors named MT1 and MT2, but also through an MLT type-3 receptor (MT3). However, the role of MLT receptor subtypes in thermoregulation is still unknown. We have thus investigated the effects of selective and non-selective MLT receptor agonists/antagonists on body temperature (Tb) in rats across the 12/12-h light-dark cycle. Rectal temperature was measured every 15 min from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., following subcutaneous injection of each compound at either 5:00 a.m. or 5:00 p.m. MLT (40 mg/kg) had no effect when injected at 5 a.m., whereas it decreased Tb during the light phase only when injected at 5:00 p.m. This effect was blocked by the selective MT2 receptor antagonist 4P-PDOT and the non-selective MT1/MT2 receptor antagonist, luzindole, but not by the α1/MT3 receptors antagonist prazosin. However, unlike MLT, neither the selective MT1 receptor partial agonist UCM871 (14 mg/kg) nor the selective MT2 partial agonist UCM924 (40 mg/kg) altered Tb during the light phase. In contrast, UCM871 injected at 5:00 p.m. increased Tb at the beginning of the dark phase, whereas UCM924 injected at 5:00 a.m. decreased Tb at the end of the dark phase. These effects were blocked by luzindole and 4P-PDOT, respectively. The MT3 receptor agonist GR135531 (10 mg/kg) did not affect Tb. These data suggest that the simultaneous activation of both MT1 and MT2 receptors is necessary to regulate Tb during the light phase, whereas in a complex but yet unknown manner, they regulate Tb differently during the dark phase. Overall, MT1 and MT2 receptors display complementary but also distinct roles in modulating circadian fluctuations of Tb.","Response of Soil Microbes to Vegetation Restoration in Coal Mining Subsidence Areas at Huaibei Coal Mine, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108967,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"Vegetation restoration is an available way to ameliorate degraded lands. In order to study the response of soil microbes to vegetation restoration in coal mining subsidence areas, the composition and distribution of soil microbes were discussed through three plots: unsubsided area (CA), new subsided area (NSA), and old subsided area (OSA) with different vegetation restoration time in Huabei coal mine. Meanwhile, changes in soil catalase and urease activity were explored and the correlation between soil bacteria, fungi, and environmental factors was analysed. The results demonstrated that Nitrospira was the dominant bacteria in all areas sampled. Microorganisms in the 0-20 cm and 40-60 cm soil layers of OSA had the highest Simpson index, whereas the index in NSA was lowest (at all soil depths). The catalase activity in NSA was significantly higher than that in CA, and there was no significant difference in catalase activity with soil depth, while the urease activity declined gradually with increasing soil depth. The urease activity in the 20-60 cm soil layer of NSA and OSA was significantly higher than that of CA. Furthermore, the distribution of bacteria was mainly affected by soil organic matter, available potassium, available phosphorus, and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, whereas pH and catalase activity mainly affected fungal distribution. These results implied that soil catalase activity in NSA and urease activity in the 20-40 cm soil layer of NSA and OSA were significantly enhanced after vegetation restoration, and that long-term plant restoration could improve soil fertility and soil microbial community diversity in coal mining areas."

Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study involving eyes with MHs which underwent 23- or 25-gauge PPV with or without phacoemulsification and all undergoing a 20% SF6 gas tamponade, follow-up to 6 months postoperatively were included at the Department of Ophthalmology, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway (12-month study period between 1 January and 31 December 2015) Pre- and post-operative Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) assessment, comprehensive eye examination and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement. as well as Optical Coherence Tomography to determine the diameter of the MH and its closure were all carried out. Results: 198 consecutive eyes operated for MH (age: 69.4 ± 7.6 years; 1.6:1 female:male ratio) were included; 35.7%/48.6% had symptoms from 3-6/6-48 months; 5.1% had high-grade myopia, 21.5% focal VMT <1500 µm with or without epiretinal membrane (ERM), and 74.0%/26.0% had phakic/pseudophakic status. Primary closure of the MH occurred in 93.3% of the patients. Lens status and length of symptoms showed no significant correlation with closure of the MH. The pre-operative logMAR visual acuity: 0.8 ± 0.3 (median: 0.7; interquartile range (IQR): 0.5-0.8; range: 0.3-1.7), improved significantly post-operatively: 0.4 ± 0.3 (median: 0.3; interquartile range (IQR): 0.1-0.5; range: -0.02-1.2). BCVA improvement of <0.2, 0.2-0.4 and >0.4 was present in 28.3%, 27.3% and 44.4% of the treated patients. No significant median differences could be detected between the duration of the pre-operative symptoms and the pre-/post-operative visual acuity. Increased IOP was measured in 2.6% of the cases day after surgery. Conclusions: Our study found visual outcome not to be dependent upon the length of symptoms in MH patients treated by PPV all undergoing ILM peeling, SF6 tamponade and face-down positioning. The large diameter MH was not a limiting factor to achieve improved post-operative BCVA.",Optimization of the Loading of an Environmentally Friendly Compatibilizer Derived from Linseed Oil in Poly(Lactic Acid)/Diatomaceous Earth Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108954,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Maleinized linseed oil (MLO) has been successfully used as biobased compatibilizer in polyester blends. Its efficiency as compatibilizer in polymer composites with organic and inorganic fillers, compared to other traditional fillers, has also been proved. The goal of this work is to optimize the amount of MLO on poly(lactic acid)/diatomaceous earth (PLA/DE) composites to open new potential to these materials in the active packaging industry without compromising the environmental efficiency of these composites. The amount of DE remains constant at 10 wt% and MLO varies from 1 to 15 phr (weight parts of MLO per 100 g of PLA/DE composite). The effect of MLO on mechanical, thermal, thermomechanical and morphological properties is described in this work. The obtained results show a clear embrittlement of the uncompatibilized PLA/DE composites, which is progressively reduced by the addition of MLO. MLO shows good miscibility at low concentrations (lower than 5 phr) while above 5 phr, a clear phase separation phenomenon can be detected, with the formation of rounded microvoids and shapes which have a positive effect on impact strength.",Genetic and Non-Genetic Factor-Adjusted Association between Coffee Drinking and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Taiwanese Adults: Stratification by Sex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108953,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of global mortality. We aimed to determine the effect of coffee drinking and sex and their interaction, as well as rs1800588 and rs1800775 polymorphisms on HDL-C levels in Taiwanese adults. Data of 4262 men and 4813 women, aged 30-70 years, were retrieved from Taiwan Biobank. The interaction between sex and coffee drinking on HDL-C was significant (p = 0.0452). Coffee consumption was significantly associated with higher HDL-C levels in only women (β = 0.81679; p = 0.0246). However, rs1800588 and rs1800775 variants were significantly associated with HDL-C in both sexes. In women, β-values were 0.99080; p = 0.0059 and 3.16277; p < 0.0001 for rs1800588 CT and TT genotypes, respectively and -1.80954; p < 0.0001 and -2.81512; p < 0.0001 for rs1800775 AC and CC genotypes, respectively.

The material was synthesized via interfacial polymerization, using ammonium per sulfate, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA), and gasoline, respectively, in the oxidant, dopant, and novel organic phase, and was subsequently employed as an electrode material to design a binder-free symmetric capacitor. As properties of PANI rely on the method of synthesis as well as reaction parameters, the present combination of reactants, at pre-optimized conditions, in the interfacial polymerization, led to the formation of PANI exhibiting a high specific capacitance (712 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag-1), a good rate capability (86% capacitance retention at 10 Ag-1), a very low solution resistance (Rs = 0.61 Ω), and a potential drop (IR = 0.01917 V). The device exhibited a high energy density of 28 Whkg-1, at a power density of 0.28 kWkg-1, and retained as high as 15.1 Whkg-1, at a high power density of 4.5 kWkg-1. Moreover, it showed an excellent cycling stability and retained 98.5% of coulombic efficiency after 5000 charge discharge cycles, without showing any signs of degradation of polymer.",Estimating the Orientation of Objects from Tactile Sensing Data Using Machine Learning Methods and Visual Frames of Reference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108951,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"Underactuated hands are useful tools for robotic in-hand manipulation tasks due to their capability to seamlessly adapt to unknown objects. To enable robots using such hands to achieve and maintain stable grasping conditions even under external disturbances while keeping track of an in-hand object's state requires learning object-tactile sensing data relationships. The human somatosensory system combines visual and tactile sensing information in their ""What and Where"" subsystem to achieve high levels of manipulation skills. The present paper proposes an approach for estimating the pose of in-hand objects combining tactile sensing data and visual frames of reference like the human ""What and Where"" subsystem. The system proposed here uses machine learning methods to estimate the orientation of in-hand objects from the data gathered by tactile sensors mounted on the phalanges of underactuated fingers. While tactile sensing provides local information about objects during in-hand manipulation, a vision system generates egocentric and allocentric frames of reference. A dual fuzzy logic controller was developed to achieve and sustain stable grasping conditions autonomously while forces were applied to in-hand objects to expose the system to different object configurations. Two sets of experiments were used to explore the system capabilities. On the first set, external forces changed the orientation of objects while the fuzzy controller kept objects in-hand for tactile and visual data collection for five machine learning estimators. Among these estimators, the ridge regressor achieved an average mean squared error of 0.077 ∘ . On the second set of experiments, one of the underactuated fingers performed open-loop object rotations and data recorded were supplied to the same set of estimators. In this scenario, the Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network achieved the lowest mean squared error of 0.067 ∘ .",Identification and Validation of Novel Reference Genes in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for Droplet Digital PCR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108950,Genes,2019 05 21,"Droplet digital PCR is the most robust method for absolute nucleic acid quantification. However, RNA is a very versatile molecule and its abundance is tissue-dependent. RNA quantification is dependent on a reference control to estimate the abundance. Additionally, in cancer, many cellular processes are deregulated which consequently affects the gene expression profiles. In this work, we performed microarray data mining of different childhood cancers and healthy controls. We selected four genes that showed no gene expression variations (PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2) and four classical reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, RPL4 and RPS18). Gene expression was validated in 40 acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples by means of droplet digital PCR. We observed that PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2 were expressed ~100 times less than ACTB, GAPDH, RPL4 and RPS18. However, we observed excellent correlations among the new reference genes (p < 0.0001). We propose that PSMB6, PGGT1B, UBQLN2 and UQCR2 are housekeeping genes with low expression in childhood cancer.",Vibrating Mesh Nebulisation of Pro-Antimicrobial Peptides for Use in Cystic Fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108949,Pharmaceutics,2019 05 21,There has been considerable interest in the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as antimicrobial therapeutics in many conditions including cystic fibrosis (CF).

In order to understand such effects on CO2 fluxes from winter wheat-soybean rotation, a field experiment was conducted by using the open-top chamber (OTCs) during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 at an agro-ecological station in southeast China. The experimental treatments included the control (CK), experimental warming (T, crop canopy temperature increased by ~2 °C), elevated O3 concentration (O, O3 concentration about 100 ppb) along with temperature enhancement (OT, elevated ~2 °C temperature plus 100 ppb O3). The results showed that warming significantly increased the mean CO2 fluxes (MCF) and the cumulative amount of CO2 (CAC) from soil and soil-crop systems, while elevated O3 and warming enhancement (OT) significantly reduced MCF and CAC. Besides, warming significantly reduced the biomass of winter-wheat, but it insignificantly decreased the biomass of soybean in the harvest period. The O and OT treatments significantly reduced the biomass of winter-wheat and soybean cropping systems in the harvest time. Both warming and elevated O3 concentration decreased the temperature sensitivity coefficients (Q10) in soil respiration during the experimental period. Overall, our results indicate that elevated O3 concentration compensates the effect of warming on CO2 emission to some extents, which has a positive feedback impact on the climate system.","Glial Cell AMPA Receptors in Nervous System Health, Injury and Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108947,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Glia form a central component of the nervous system whose varied activities sustain an environment that is optimised for healthy development and neuronal function. Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) are a central mediator of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission, yet they are also expressed in a wide range of glial cells where they influence a variety of important cellular functions. AMPAR enable glial cells to sense the activity of neighbouring axons and synapses, and as such many aspects of glial cell development and function are influenced by the activity of neural circuits. However, these AMPAR also render glia sensitive to elevations of the extracellular concentration of glutamate, which are associated with a broad range of pathological conditions. Excessive activation of AMPAR under these conditions may induce excitotoxic injury in glial cells, and trigger pathophysiological responses threatening other neural cells and amplifying ongoing disease processes. The aim of this review is to gather information on AMPAR function from across the broad diversity of glial cells, identify their contribution to pathophysiological processes, and highlight new areas of research whose progress may increase our understanding of nervous system dysfunction and disease.",When a Slice Is Not Enough!

Forty-six small chromosomes were identified in four species. (AGGGTTT)3 signals were observed on almost all chromosome ends of four species, but (AGGGTTT)3 played no role in distinguishing the chromosomes but displayed intact chromosomes and could thus be used as a guide for finding chromosome counts. (TTG)6 and 5S rDNA signals discerned several chromosomes located at subterminal or central regions. Based on the similarity of the signal pattern (mainly in number and location and less in intensity) of the four species, the variations in the 5S rDNA and (TTG)6 distribution can be ordered as L. lucidum < L. × vicaryi < F. pennsylvanica < S. oblata. Variations have observed in the three genera.

The main objective was that the BCI should be able to recognize brain activity. BCI is an emerging technology which focuses on communication between software and hardware and permitting the use of brain activity to control electronic devices, such as wheelchairs, computers and robots. The interface was developed, and consists of EEG Bitronics, Arduino and a computer; moreover, two versions of the BCIANNET software were developed to be used with this hardware. This BCI used artificial neural network (ANN) as a main processing method, with the Butterworth filter used as the data pre-processing algorithm for ANN. Twelve subjects were measured to collect the datasets. Tasks were given to subjects to stimulate brain activity. The purpose of the experiments was to test and confirm the performance of the developed software. The aim of the software was to separate important rhythms such as alpha, beta, gamma and delta from other EEG signals. As a result, this study showed that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the best compared with the backpropagation, resilient backpropagation, and error correction algorithms. The final developed version of the software is an effective tool for research in the field of BCI. The study showed that using the Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm gave an accuracy of prediction around 60% on the testing dataset.",Maintaining the Outcomes of a Successful Weight Gain Prevention Intervention in Mid-Age Women: Two Year Results from the 40-Something Randomized Control Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108930,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Despite the life stage of menopause being identified as a high risk for weight gain, there are few obesity prevention interventions for this target group, and no evidence on maintenance of intervention effects after intervention support is withdrawn. In the 40-Something Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (ACTRN12611000064909), a five-consultation health professional (dietitian and exercise physiologist) obesity prevention intervention, using motivational interviewing principles (MI) over 12 months, achieved significantly greater weight loss than a self-directed intervention (SDI) (tailored written material) in 54 non-obese (body mass index (BMI): 18.5-29.9 kg/m2), premenopausal women (44-50 years). The aim of the current paper is to report on whether the intervention effects were maintained at two years. Anthropometric, biochemical and health behavior data were collected at baseline, 12 months (end of intervention) and 24 months (end of maintenance period). Forty participants (22 = MI, 18 = SDI) who completed all measures to 12 months were invited to participate in the monitoring phase and 30 (MI = 16, SDI = 14) consented. The primary outcome of weight at 24 months was assessed using intention to treat principles (n = 54), adjusting for baseline weight. The MI group had a significantly lower weight at 24 months (64.6 kg, 95% CI: 63.2, 66.6, p = 0.015) compared with the SDI group (67.3 kg, 95% CI: 65.7, 68.8), and the secondary outcomes of percentage body fat and waist circumference were also significantly lower in the MI group. The low-intensity, health professional weight control intervention utilizing MI principles was more efficacious in maintaining a significant weight loss compared to a self-directed intervention, and both were successful in preventing obesity.",Microcontroller Implementation of Support Vector Machine for Detecting Blood Glucose Levels Using Breath Volatile Organic Compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108929,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"This paper presents an embedded system-based solution for sensor arrays to estimate blood glucose levels from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a patient's breath.

Both the PWD and TLD were found in 15 of the administrative areas, and neither was found in three areas (Penghu, Kinmen, and Lienchiang County). Either the PWD or TLD (but not both) were found in four areas (only have PWD: Hsinchu and Chiayi City; only have TLD: Yunlin and Taitung County). How the priorities should be set for dementia service allocation based on these findings was also addressed. We conclude that the indicators of PWD and TLD can add value to the policy decision-making process, help set priorities, and facilitate efficient and fair resource allocation by defining specifics of the resources needed.",Physical and Physiological Responses during the Stop-Ball Rule During Small-Sided Games in Soccer Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108927,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Small-sided games (SSGs) are a recommended training method for significant performance enhancement, and training efficiency. The stop-ball (SSG-SB) effects on physical responses (e.g., acceleration, deceleration, sprints, total distance, and indicator of workload) have not been investigated yet. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the SSG-SB compared to the small-goals SSG (SSG-SG) on physical and heart rate (HR) responses at high intensity (total distance (>18 km/h)), sprints (>18 km/h), and acceleration and deceleration (>3 m/s²) during a 4 vs. 4 SSG format in youth professional soccer players. Sixteen male elite young soccer players (mean ± SD body height, 176.5 ± 6.3 cm; age, 18.3 ± 0.7 years; body weight, 73.4 ± 7.2 kg) performed two forms of SSGs, i.e., SSG-SB or SSG-SG, for 4 × 4 min with a recovery of 2 min between sets. Data were compared using the t-test. The SSG-SB induced a significantly higher mean HR (180.0 ± 2.0 vs. 173.0 ± 3.0 beats per minute; p < 0.05) compared to the SSG-SG. Likewise, the SSG-SB was significantly higher compared to the SSG-SG for total distance (2580 ± 220.3 vs. 2230 ± 210 m; p < 0.001), player load (98.07 ± 12.5 vs. 89.4 ± 10.5; p < 0.05), sprint distance (7.9 ± 2.3 vs. 5.2 ± 2.0 m; p < 0.05), acceleration (15.6 ± 2.75 vs. 12.5 ± 1.75; p < 0.05), and deceleration (17.3 ± 3.20 vs. 14.4 ± 2.55; p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the SSG-SG and the SSG-SB for maximal velocity, power, and sprints duration.

In this work, we report the preparation of visible light-responsive capsules obtained via oil-in-water interfacial polycondensation between modified diacyl-chloride azobenzene moiety and diamine flexible spacer in the presence of cross-linkers with different structures and functionalities. The effect on the release profile of the encapsulated perfume oil was investigated using three flexible spacers with different lengths (1,8-diaminooctane; 1,6-diaminohexane and 1,4-diaminobutane) and two types of cross-linkers (1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride and melamine). We analyzed how the properties of microcapsules can be tailored changing the design of the shell structure. Fine tuning of the perfume release profiles was obtained. The changes in capsules size and morphology due to visible light irradiation were monitored via light scattering, optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Perfume release was 50% faster in the systems prepared with melamine as the cross-linker. Modelling studies were carried out to support the discussion of the experimental results.","Cloning, Purification, and Characterization of a β-Carbonic Anhydrase from Malassezia restricta, an Opportunistic Pathogen Involved in Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108925,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"The cloning, purification, and initial characterization of the β-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) from the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Malassezia restricta (MreCA), which a fungus involved in dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis (SD), is reported. MreCA is a protein consisting of 230 amino acid residues and shows high catalytic activity for the hydration of CO2 into bicarbonate and protons, with the following kinetic parameters: kcat of 1.06 × 106 s-1 and kcat/KM of 1.07 × 108 M-1 s-1. It is also sensitive to inhibition by the sulfonamide acetazolamide (KI of 50.7 nM). Phylogenetically, MreCA and other CAs from various Malassezia species seem to be on a different branch, distinct from that of other β-CAs found in fungi, such as Candida spp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Sordaria macrospora, with only Cryptococcus neoformans and Ustilago maydis enzymes clustering near MreCA.

It has, however, been questioned whether this association is genuine, since C15:0 and C17:0 are also biomarkers from fish. We investigated whether the above biomarkers are reliable markers for dairy fat intake in 864 healthy subjects. Subsequently, we explored the association between these biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors. Intakes of dairy and fish were determined by Food Frequency Questionnaires FFQs. Fatty acids were analyzed in plasma triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL). Median intakes of dairy and fish fat were 12.3 (8.4-17.4) g/day and 1.14 (0.53-1.75) g/day. All fatty acids, except TG C17:0, were associated with dairy fat (std.β range TG: 0.12 for C14:0 till 0.25 for C15:0 and Trans-C18:1 (n-7); and std.β range PL: 0.12 for C17:0 and Trans-C16:1 (n-7) till 0.24 for Trans-C18:1 (n-7) and CLA; p < 0.001). TG C17:0 was associated with fish fat (std.β = 0.08; p = 0.03), whereas PL C17:0 was not. Associations remained after adjustment for fish/dairy fat intake. Strongest inverse associations with biological variables were found with PL C17:0 and Trans-C18:1 (n-7) (Std.βs: waist circumference: -0.18, p < 0.001 and -0.10, p < 0.05; BMI: -0.17, p < 0.001, -0.11, p < 0.01; glucose: -0.10, p <0.01 and -0.08, p <0.05; high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): -0.22, p < 0.001 and -0.16, p < 0.01; uric acid: -0.27, p < 0.001 and -0.24, p < 0.001). In conclusion, fatty acid biomarkers, except plasma TG C17:0, were associated with dairy fat intake, independent of fish fat intake.

In order to investigate the postharvest antioxidant capacities of MP pulp and determine the optimal harvesting time, fruits that were harvested at three different maturities (185, 200, and 215 days after full bloom) were observed for 180 days of preservation at ambient temperature. An abundance of ascorbic acid and lycopene in the MP pulp was found during storage, and in Harvest I, these substances were significantly higher than in Harvest II and Harvest III fruit (p < 0.05). The activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), and catalases (CAT) in Harvest I and Harvest II were far higher after 90 days. The radical scavenging ability of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, superoxide anion radical (O2-•), and hydroxyl radical (•OH) in Harvest I and Harvest II were higher. There was a significantly positive correlation (p < 0.01) between the antioxidant components (ascorbic acid, lycopene, carotenoids, total phenols, and total flavonoids), enzyme activity, and radical scavenging ability. The comprehensive scores determined by principal component analysis (PCA) in Harvest I and II were higher than those in Harvest III. Therefore, the optimal harvesting period of MP for each year is determined to be early November.

Cytokinesis D is thought to be mediated by chemotaxis, where midwife cells migrate toward dividing cells by sensing an unknown chemoattractant secreted from the cleavage furrow. In this study, to validate this chemotaxis model, we aspirated the fluid from the vicinity of the cleavage furrow of a dividing Dictyostelium cell and discharged it onto a neighboring cell using a microcapillary. However, the neighboring cells did not show any chemotaxis toward the fluid. In addition, the cells did not manifest an increase in the levels of intracellular Ca2+, cAMP, or cGMP, which are expected to rise in chemotaxing cells. From several lines of our experiments, including these findings, we concluded that chemotaxis does not contribute to cytokinesis D. As an alternative, we propose a cortical-flow model, where a migrating cell attaches to a dividing cell by chance and is guided toward the furrow by the cortical flow on the dividing cell, and then physically assists the separation of the daughter cells.",Electrical Properties of Thiol-ene-based Shape Memory Polymers Intended for Flexible Electronics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108911,Polymers,2019 05 21,"Thiol-ene/acrylate-based shape memory polymers (SMPs) with tunable mechanical and thermomechanical properties are promising substrate materials for flexible electronics applications. These UV-curable polymer compositions can easily be polymerized onto pre-fabricated electronic components and can be molded into desired geometries to provide a shape-changing behavior or a tunable softness. Alternatively, SMPs may be prepared as a flat substrate, and electronic circuitry may be built directly on top by thin film processing technologies. Whichever way the final structure is produced, the operation of electronic circuits will be influenced by the electrical and mechanical properties of the underlying (and sometimes also encapsulating) SMP substrate. Here, we present electronic properties, such as permittivity and resistivity of a typical SMP composition that has a low glass transition temperature (between 40 and 60 °C dependent on the curing process) in different thermomechanical states of polymer. We fabricated parallel plate capacitors from a previously reported SMP composition (fully softening (FS)-SMP) using two different curing processes, and then we determined the electrical properties of relative permittivity and resistivity below and above the glass transition temperature. Our data shows that the curing process influenced the electrical permittivity, but not the electrical resistivity. Corona-Kelvin metrology evaluated the quality of the surface of FS-SMP spun on the wafer. Overall, FS-SMP demonstrates resistivity appropriate for use as an insulating material.",The Impact of Mediterranean Dietary Patterns During Pregnancy on Maternal and Offspring Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108910,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"(1) Background: Pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child are affected by many environmental factors. The importance of pregnancy for 'early life programming' is well established and maternal nutrition is an important factor contributing to a favourable environment for developing offspring.

Pregnant women and those trying to conceive should be advised to follow a Mediterranean Diet to potentially decrease, for example, the likelihood of atopy (OR 0.55) in the offspring and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in the mother (OR 0.73).",Effects of Long-Term Storage at -80 °C on the Human Plasma Metabolome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108909,Metabolites,2019 05 21,"High-quality biological samples are required for the favorable outcome of research studies, and valid data sets are crucial for successful biomarker identification. Prolonged storage of biospecimens may have an artificial effect on compound levels. In order to investigate the potential effects of long-term storage on the metabolome, human ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples stored for up to 16 years were analyzed by gas and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Only 2% of 231 tested plasma metabolites were altered in the first seven years of storage. However, upon longer storage periods of up to 16 years and more time differences of few years significantly affected up to 26% of the investigated metabolites when analyzed within subject age groups. Ontology classes that were most affected included complex lipids, fatty acids, energy metabolism molecules, and amino acids. In conclusion, the human plasma metabolome is adequately stable to long-term storage at -80 °C for up to seven years but significant changes occur upon longer storage. However, other biospecimens may display different sensitivities to long-term storage. Therefore, in retrospective studies on EDTA plasma samples, analysis is best performed within the first seven years of storage.","Threads Made with Blended Biopolymers: Mechanical, Physical and Biological Features.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108907,Polymers,2019 05 21,"Poly (Lactic Acid), PLA, and Poly (ε-CaproLactone), PCL, compatibilized with Ethyl Ester l-Lysine Triisocyanate (LTI) can be employed as biomaterials.

In order to study the possible application of these threads, mechanical tensile (with the calorimetric and morphological investigations) and biological tests were performed. The results highlighted these biopolymers as promising materials for sutures since they can be rigid and elastic (especially by increasing the PCL amount in the blend), and they are bioactive, able to inhibit bacterial growth.

This study was undertaken to determine whether ionizing radiation alters the CAF-mediated immunoregulatory effects on macrophages. CAFs were isolated from freshly-resected non-small cell lung cancer tumors, while monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared from peripheral blood of healthy donors. Experimental settings included both (CAF-macrophage) co-cultures and incubations of M0 and M1-macrophages in the presence of CAF-conditioned medium (CAF-CM). Functional assays to study macrophage polarization/activation included the expression of cell surface markers, production of nitric oxide, secretion of inflammatory cytokines and migratory capacity. We show that CAFs promote changes in M0-macrophages that harmonize with both M1-and M2-phenotypes. Additionally, CAFs inhibit pro-inflammatory features of M1-macrophages by reducing nitric oxide production, pro-inflammatory cytokines, migration, and M1-surface markers expression. Radiation delivered as single-high dose or in fractioned regimens did not modify the immunoregulatory features exerted by CAFs over macrophages in vitro. Protein expression analyses of CAF supernatants showed that irradiated and non-irradiated CAFs produce approximately the same protein levels of immunoregulators. Thus, CAF-derived soluble factors mediate measurable changes on uncommitted macrophages and down-regulate pro-inflammatory features of M1-polarized macrophages. Notably, ionizing radiation does not curtail the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive effects.","Effect of Plyometric Training on Jumping, Sprinting and Change of Direction Speed in Child Female Athletes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108905,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of plyometric training on jumping, sprinting, and change of direction (COD) performance.","2,4-Thiazolidinedione in Well-Fed Lactating Dairy Goats: I. Effect on Adiposity and Milk Fat Synthesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108904,Veterinary sciences,2019 05 21,"Background: In a prior experiment, treatment of goats with the putative PPARγ agonist 2,4-thiazolidinedione (2,4-TZD) did not affect milk fat or expression of milk-fat related genes. The lack of response was possibly due to deficiency of vitamin A and/or a poor body condition of the animals. In the present experiment, we tested the hypothesis that PPARγ activation affects milk fat synthesis in goats with a good body condition and receiving adequate levels of vitamin A. Methods: Lactating goats receiving a diet that met NRC requirements, including vitamin A, were injected with 8 mg/kg BW of 2,4-TZD (n = 6) or saline (n = 6; CTR) daily for 26 days. Blood metabolic profiling and milk yield and components were measured including fatty acid profile. Expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism was measured in adipose tissue and in mammary epithelial cells (MEC). Size of adipocytes was assessed by histological analysis. Results: NEFA, BHBA, and fatty acids available in plasma decreased while glucose increased in 2,4-TZD vs. CTR. Size of cells and expression of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism-related genes were larger in 2,4-TZD vs. CTR in adipose tissue. In MEC, expression of SCD1 and desaturation of stearate was lower in 2,4-TZD vs. CTR. Conclusions: Overall data revealed a lack of PPARγ activation by 2,4-TZD and no effect on milk fat synthesis despite a strong anti-lipolysis effect on adipose tissue.",Fine Mapping of the Wheat Leaf Rust Resistance Gene Lr42.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108903,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks is one of the most problematic diseases of wheat throughout the world. The gene Lr42 confers effective resistance against leaf rust at both seedling and adult plant stages. Previous studies had reported Lr42 to be both recessive and dominant in hexaploid wheat; however, in diploid Aegilops tauschii (TA2450), we found Lr42 to be dominant by studying segregation in two independent F2 and their F2:3 populations. We further fine-mapped Lr42 in hexaploid wheat using a KS93U50/Morocco F5 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population to a 3.7 cM genetic interval flanked by markers TC387992 and WMC432. The 3.7 cM Lr42 region physically corresponds to a 3.16 Mb genomic region on chromosome 1DS based on the Chinese Spring reference genome (RefSeq v.1.1) and a 3.5 Mb genomic interval on chromosome 1 in the Ae. tauschii reference genome. This region includes nine nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes in wheat and seven in Ae. tauschii, respectively, and these are the likely candidates for Lr42. Furthermore, we developed two kompetitive allele-specific polymorphism (KASP) markers (SNP113325 and TC387992) flanking Lr42 to facilitate marker-assisted selection for rust resistance in wheat breeding programs."

Meanwhile, current studies of this method mostly have deduced protein states in cells exclusively based on 'indirect' structural information from peak patterns and chemical shift changes but not 'direct' data explicitly including interatomic distances and angles. To fully understand the functions and physical properties of proteins inside cells, it is indispensable to obtain explicit structural data or determine three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins in cells. Whilst the short lifetime of cells in a sample tube, low sample concentrations, and massive background signals make it difficult to observe NMR signals from proteins inside cells, several methodological advances help to overcome the problems. Paramagnetic effects have an outstanding potential for in-cell structural analysis. The combination of a limited amount of experimental in-cell data with software for ab initio protein structure prediction opens an avenue to visualise 3D protein structures inside cells. Conventional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)-based structure determination is advantageous to elucidate the conformations of side-chain atoms of proteins as well as global structures.

The effects of growth temperature and V/III ratio on the surface morphology and defect structure were studied. The growth conditions which were developed for the growth of cascaded In0.53Ga0.47As/In0.52Al0.48As active region, e.g., growth temperature of Tg = 520 °C and V/III ratio of 12, turned out to be not optimum for the growth of thick In0.52Al0.48As waveguide layers. It has been observed that, after exceeding ~1 µm thickness, the quality of In0.52Al0.48As layers deteriorates. The in-situ optical reflectometry showed increasing surface roughness caused by defect forming, which was further confirmed by high resolution X-ray reciprocal space mapping, optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The presented optimization of growth conditions of In0.52Al0.48As waveguide layer led to the growth of defect free material, with good optical quality. This has been achieved by decreasing the growth temperature to Tg = 480 °C with appropriate increasing V/III ratio. At the same time, the growth conditions of the cascade active region of the laser were left unchanged. The lasers grown using new recipes have shown lower threshold currents and improved slope efficiency. We relate this performance improvement to reduction of the electron scattering on the interface roughness and decreased waveguide absorption losses.",Drug Discovery for Chagas Disease: Impact of Different Host Cell Lines on Assay Performance and Hit Compound Selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108888,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 05 21,"Cell-based screening has become the major compound interrogation strategy in Chagas disease drug discovery. Several different cell lines have been deployed as host cells in screening assays. However, host cell characteristics and host-parasite interactions may play an important role when assessing anti-T. cruzi compound activity, ultimately impacting on hit discovery. To verify this hypothesis, four distinct mammalian cell lines (U2OS, THP-1, Vero and L6) were used as T. cruzi host cells in High Content Screening assays. Rates of infection varied greatly between different host cells. Susceptibility to benznidazole also varied, depending on the host cell and parasite strain. A library of 1,280 compounds was screened against the four different cell lines infected with T. cruzi, resulting in the selection of a total of 82 distinct compounds as hits. From these, only two hits were common to all four cell lines assays (2.4%) and 51 were exclusively selected from a single assay (62.2%). Infected U2OS cells were the most sensitive assay, as 55 compounds in total were identified as hits; infected THP-1 yielded the lowest hit rates, with only 16 hit compounds. Of the selected hits, compound FPL64176 presented selective anti-T. cruzi activity and could serve as a starting point for the discovery of new anti-chagasic drugs.",Applying Aluminum⁻Vertically-Aligned Carbon Nanotube Forests Composites for Heat Dissipation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108887,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Vertically-aligned carbon nanotube forests (VACNTs) with excellent axial heat dissipation properties were formed on aluminum foil to dissipate heat.

In addition, the performance was compared with copper and pyrolytic graphite sheets. The experimental results revealed that the heat dissipation efficiency of the flexible aluminum-VACNTs composites was higher than that of clean aluminum foil, a copper sheet, and a pyrolytic graphite sheet by up to 56%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. Moreover, this work also verified the height of the carbon nanotube (CNT) did not influence the heat dissipation efficiency, indicating that the time cost of synthesis could be reduced.",Spatio-Temporal Variation in the Concentration of Inhalable Particulate Matter (PM10) in Uganda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108886,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"Long-term particulate matter (PM10) measurements were conducted during the period January 2016 to September 2017 at three sites in Uganda (Mbarara, Kyebando, and Rubindi) representing a wide range of urbanization. Spatial, temporal and diurnal variations are assessed in this paper. Particulate matter (PM10) samples were collected for 24-h periods on PTFE filters using a calibrated pump and analyzed gravimetrically to determine the average density. Particulate levels were monitored simultaneously using a light scattering instrument to acquire real time data from which diurnal variations were assessed. The PM10 levels averaged over the sampling period at Mbarara, Kyebando, and Rubindi were 5.8, 8.4, and 6.5 times higher than the WHO annual air quality guideline of 20 µg·m-3, and values exceeded the 24-h mean PM10 guideline of 50 µg·m-3 on 83, 100, and 86% of the sampling days. Higher concentrations were observed during dry seasons at all sites. Seasonal differences were statistically significant at Rubindi and Kyebando. Bimodal peaks were observed in the diurnal analysis with higher morning peaks at Mbarara and Kyebando, which points to the impact of traffic sources, while the higher evening peak at Rubindi points to the influence of dust suspension, roadside cooking and open-air waste burning. Long-term measurement showed unhealthy ambient air in all three locations tested in Uganda, with significant spatial and seasonal differences.",The Stability of Intercalated Sericite by Cetyl Trimethylammonium Ion under Different Conditions and the Preparation of Sericite/Polymer Nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108885,Polymers,2019 05 21,"Layered silicates are suitable for use as fillers in nanocomposites based on their particular features, such as large aspect ratio, easy availability, and chemical resistance. Among them, sericite is distinguished for its higher aspect ratio, higher resilience, and ultraviolet shielding and absorption. Previously, sericite was structure-modified and intercalated by CTAB to expand its interlayer space. The intercalated sericite seems promising for use in the fabrication of polymer/sericite composites or pillared sericite. However, special attention should be paid to the stability of the intercalated sericite because the CTAB inside the layer may be de-intercalated, which would affect the interlayer spacing and its surface properties. In this article, the stability of the sericite intercalated by CTAB was tested by changing different variables, such as different washing solvents, different temperatures, ultrasonic cleaning, and different solution conditions. Finally, sericite/polymer nanocomposites were produced with the stable intercalated sericite, and showed excellent properties compared with pure epoxy resin.",Discovery of 2-(1-(3-(4-Chloroxyphenyl)-3-oxo- propyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-4-carboxamide: A Potent Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor for Treatment of Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108884,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"A series of benzimidazole carboxamide derivatives have been synthesized and characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HRMS.

Among these, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown unparalleled therapeutic potential in treating refractory hematological malignancies. In contrast, solid tumors pose a much greater challenge to CAR T cell therapy, which has yet to be overcome. As this novel therapeutic modality matures, increasing effort is being invested to determine the optimal structure and properties of CARs to facilitate the transition from empirical testing to the rational design of CAR T cells. In this review, we highlight how individual CAR domains contribute to the success and failure of this promising treatment modality and provide an insight into the most notable advances in the field of CAR T cell engineering.",A New Tyrosinase Inhibitor from the Red Alga Symphyocladia latiuscula (Harvey) Yamada (Rhodomelaceae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108882,Marine drugs,2019 05 21,"A marine red alga, Symphyocladia latiuscula (Harvey) Yamada (Rhodomelaceae), is a rich source of bromophenols with a wide array of biological activities. This study investigates the anti-tyrosinase activity of the alga. Moderate activity was demonstrated by the methanol extract of S. latiuscula, and subsequent column chromatography identified three bromophenols: 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl alcohol (1), 2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl ether (2), and bis-(2,3,6-tribromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl methyl ether) (3). Bromophenols 1 and 3 exhibited potent competitive tyrosinase inhibitory activity against l-tyrosine substrates, with IC50 values of 10.78 ± 0.19 and 2.92 ± 0.04 μM, respectively. Against substrate l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), compounds 1 and 3 demonstrated moderate activity, while 2 showed no observable effect. The experimental data were verified by a molecular docking study that found catalytic hydrogen and halogen interactions were responsible for the activity. In addition, compounds 1 and 3 exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects in melanin and intracellular tyrosinase levels in α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced B16F10 melanoma cells.

Notably, intertumoral heterogeneity is a large hurdle to overcome for establishing standard cancer treatment, necessitating disease models better than conventional established 2D cell lines for screening novel treatment candidates. In the present review, we outline recent progress regarding experimental cancer models having more physiological and clinical relevance for drug screening, which are important for the successful evaluation of cellular response to drugs. The review is particularly focused on drug screening using the cancer organoid model, which is emerging as a better physiological disease model than conventional established 2D cell lines. We also review the use of cancer organoids to examine intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity, and introduce the perspective of the clinical use of cancer organoids to enable precision medicine.",Exploring the Experiences of People with Obesity Using Portion Control Tools-A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108869,Nutrients,2019 05 21,"Large portion sizes increase consumption and eating smaller portions is recommended as a weight control strategy. However, many people report difficulties enacting this advice. This study examined the experience of individuals using two commercially available portion-control tools to try to manage their weight. In a crossover design, 29 adults with obesity (18 women) who had attended a previous weight loss intervention in the community were invited to use two portion-control tool sets over a period of four weeks (two weeks each) and to complete a semi-structured questionnaire about their experience. The tools were a guided crockery set (sector plate, calibrated bowl, and calibrated glass) and a set of calibrated serving spoons (one for starch, one for protein, and one for vegetables). Data were analyzed using thematic framework analysis. A key theme was related to the educational benefits of the tools, such as generating awareness, guidance, and gaining an independent ability to judge appropriate portions. Other key themes were tool usability, acceptability, and feasibility of usage. Barriers identified by participants included unclear markings/instructions and the inconvenience of using the tool when eating away from home. Overall, the tools were perceived to be educationally useful, easy to use, and potentially effective for learning to control portions, which suggested that these instruments could help in weight management interventions alongside other strategies. Elements of the tool design could influence the ability of participants to adhere to using the tool, and hence allow the educational effect to be mediated.","Comparison and Combination of Thermal, Fluorescence, and Hyperspectral Imaging for Monitoring Fusarium Head Blight of Wheat on Spikelet Scale.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108868,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"Optical sensors have shown high capabilities to improve the detection and monitoring of plant disease development. This study was designed to compare the feasibility of different sensors to characterize Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum. Under controlled conditions, time-series measurements were performed with infrared thermography (IRT), chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI), and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) starting 3 days after inoculation (dai). IRT allowed the visualization of temperature differences within the infected spikelets beginning 5 dai. At the same time, a disorder of the photosynthetic activity was confirmed by CFI via maximal fluorescence yields of spikelets (Fm) 5 dai. Pigment-specific simple ratio PSSRa and PSSRb derived from HSI allowed discrimination between Fusarium-infected and non-inoculated spikelets 3 dai. This effect on assimilation started earlier and was more pronounced with F. graminearum. Except the maximum temperature difference (MTD), all parameters derived from different sensors were significantly correlated with each other and with disease severity (DS). A support vector machine (SVM) classification of parameters derived from IRT, CFI, or HSI allowed the differentiation between non-inoculated and infected spikelets 3 dai with an accuracy of 78, 56 and 78%, respectively. Combining the IRT-HSI or CFI-HSI parameters improved the accuracy to 89% 30 dai.","Evaluation of Residual Efficacy of Pyrethrin + Methoprene Aerosol on Two Dermestids: Impact of Particle Size, Species, and Temperature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108866,Insects,2019 05 21,"Residual effects of pyrethrin + methoprene aerosol dispensed at 4 and 16-µm particle sizes and an untreated control, was assessed against late-stage larvae of Trogoderma inclusum (LeConte), the larger cabinet beetle, and T. variabile (Ballion), the warehouse beetle. Treated arenas were stored at 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C and bioassays were conducted at 1, 3, or 6 weeks post-treatment. Larval development was monitored through adult emergence to compare the efficacy of treatments by using both the percentage of normal adult emergence and a developmental index as dependent variables. There was no overall effect of temperature on residual activity as measured using either adult emergence or developmental index values. Both the 4 and 16-µm particle sizes resulted in reduced adult emergence and low developmental index values compared to untreated controls. The insecticide was more effective on T. variabile than on T. inclusum. The impact of particle size varied between species, both particle sizes reduced adult emergence and developmental index in T. variabile, but only the 16-µm particle size resulted in reduction of adult emergence of T. inclusum. Furthermore, there was a reduction in activity of methoprene with residual exposure time. The variations in susceptibility of species to methoprene, differences in efficacy of particle sizes, and decrease in residual persistence at smaller particle sizes highlight the need for attaining optimal particle size to improve overall efficacy of aerosol mixtures containing methoprene.",Structural Characteristics and In Vitro Digestibility of Malic Acid-Treated Corn Starch with Different pH Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108865,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of pH value on the in vitro digestibility of malic acid-treated corn starch in relation to its structural properties. Varying pH values (1.5-8.5) of 2 M malic acid solution were combined with corn starch in a forced-air oven at 130 °C for 12 h. Using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), carbonyl groups were detected in malic acid-treated corn starch, indicating cross-linking through esterification. As the pH value of malic acid-treated corn starch decreased from 8.5 to 1.5, the resistant starch content increased from 18.2 to 74.8%. This was the result of an increased degree of substitution and was maintained after gelatinization. The granular structure of malic acid-treated corn starches was not destroyed, and the starches maintained birefringence. This malic acid-treated corn starch could be utilized in heat processed foods such as bread and cookies as well as in products with reduced calories.",Maternal Body Mass Index and Gestational Weight Gain and Their Association with Pregnancy Complications and Perinatal Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108864,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of selected pregnancy pathologies statistically depending on overweight/obesity and excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy on women who gave birth in the years 2013-2015 at the Second Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the University Hospital in Bratislava, Slovakia. In a retrospective study, we analyzed data gathered from the sample, which consisted of 7122 women. Our results suggest a statistically significant, higher risk for the groups of women with overweight and obesity and gestational hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 15.3; 95% CI 9.0-25.8 for obesity), preeclampsia (AOR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.9-6.0 for overweight and AOR = 13.2; 95% CI 7.7-22.5 for obesity), and gestational diabetes mellitus (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.2-2.9 for overweight and AOR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-4.0 for obesity). A higher incidence of pregnancies terminated by cesarean section was observed in the group of obese women. Gestational weight gain above IOM (Institute of Medicine) recommendations was associated with a higher risk of pregnancy terminated by C-section (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.3), gestational hypertension (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.0-2.7), and infant macrosomia (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.3-2.1). Overweight and obesity during pregnancy significantly contribute to the development of pregnancy pathologies and increased incidence of cesarean section.

Yet, few studies have considered if and why states adopt related multiple policies-a package of reforms-in a policy area. Are more innovative states in DUI policy likely to adopt a comprehensive set of policies or use them as substitutes for each other? In this study, we assess how overall state innovativeness relates to the adoption of sixteen DUI (Driving Under the Influence) laws. We find that state innovativeness in traffic safety policies (but not overall policy innovativeness), organizational size, and professionalism of a state highway department increase the likelihood that a state will adopt a more comprehensive bundle of DUI laws. Furthermore, we also test whether institutional or competitive bandwagon effects are found across this policy area and demonstrate that national institutional bandwagon effects are an important factor related to the increased comprehensiveness of state adoption of DUI policies.",Manual Massage Therapy for Patients with COPD: A Scoping Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108862,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 21,"Background and objectives: Manual massage therapy is a therapeutic option for the treatment of several pathological conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system. It has been pointed out that massage might be beneficial for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients thanks to therapeutic effects primarily related to hyperemia (increased skin temperature and blood flow), and activation of the lymphatic system. The present study reports current evidence on the systemic effects of manual massage in patients with COPD. Materials and Methods: A scoping review was conducted on five major databases. The search went through all databases since their inception until December 2018. Results: Seventy-eight citations were retrieved; after the selection process was completed, seven articles were considered eligible. In patients receiving manual massage, improvements were observed in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s, dyspnea perception, and in the 6-min walking test. Conclusions: To date, the use of manual massage in patients with COPD is not supported by substantial evidence in the literature: indeed, it is proposed as a therapeutic option in association with other interventions such as physical exercise.","N1-Propargylguanosine Modified mRNA Cap Analogs: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Applications to the Study of Cap-Binding Proteins.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108861,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"The mRNA 5' cap consists of N7-methylguanosine bound by a 5',5'-triphosphate bridge to the first nucleotide of the transcript. The cap interacts with various specific proteins and participates in all key mRNA-related processes, which may be of therapeutic relevance. There is a growing demand for new biophysical and biochemical methods to study cap-protein interactions and identify the factors which inhibit them. The development of such methods can be aided by the use of properly designed fluorescent molecular probes. Herein, we synthesized a new class of m7Gp3G cap derivatives modified with an alkyne handle at the N1-position of guanosine and, using alkyne-azide cycloaddition, we functionalized them with fluorescent tags to obtain potential probes. The cap derivatives and probes were evaluated in the context of two cap-binding proteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) and decapping scavenger (DcpS). Biochemical and biophysical studies revealed that N1-propargyl moiety did not significantly disturb cap-protein interaction. The fluorescent properties of the probes turned out to be in line with microscale thermophoresis (MST)-based binding assays.",Georeferencing of Laser Scanner-Based Kinematic Multi-Sensor Systems in the Context of Iterated Extended Kalman Filters Using Geometrical Constraints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108860,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 23,"Georeferencing is an indispensable necessity regarding operating with kinematic multi-sensor systems (MSS) in various indoor and outdoor areas. Information from object space combined with various types of prior information (e.g., geometrical constraints) are beneficial especially in challenging environments where common solutions for pose estimation (e.g., global navigation satellite system or external tracking by a total station) are inapplicable, unreliable or inaccurate. Consequently, an iterated extended Kalman filter is used and a general georeferencing approach by means of recursive state estimation is introduced. This approach is open to several types of observation inputs and can deal with (non)linear systems and measurement models. The capability of using both explicit and implicit formulations of the relation between states and observations, and the consideration of (non)linear equality and inequality state constraints is a special feature. The framework presented is evaluated by an indoor kinematic MSS based on a terrestrial laser scanner. The focus here is on the impact of several different combinations of applied state constraints and the dependencies of two classes of inertial measurement units (IMU). The results presented are based on real measurement data combined with simulated IMU measurements."

The decay of different diameter ranges (600-1600 nm) of TNT islands was imaged at various temperatures isothermally such that an activation energy could be obtained. The activation energy of the sublimation of TNT increases as the diameter of islands increases. It was found that the coarsening and the sublimation rate of TNT islands can be determined by the local environment of the TNT surface. This result demonstrates that a diffusion model cannot be simply applied to ""real world"" systems for explaining the sublimation behavior and for estimating the coarsening of TNT.",Performances of Cement Mortar Incorporating Superabsorbent Polymer (SAP) Using Different Dosing Methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108848,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"Modified cement mortar was prepared by incorporating a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) with two kinds of dosing state, dry powdery SAP and swelled SAP (where the SAP has been pre-wetted in tap water), respectively. The mechanical properties, drying shrinkage and freeze-thaw resistance of the mortars were compared and analyzed with the variation of SAP content and entrained water-to-cement ratios. Additionally, the effect of SAP on the microstructure of mortar was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that agglomerative accumulation is formed in the voids of mortar after water desorption from SAP and there are abundant hydration products, most of which are C-S-H gels, around the SAP voids. The incorporation of the powdery SAP increases the 28 d compressive strength of the mortars by about 10% to 50%, while for the incorporation of swelled SAP, the 28 d compressive strength of the mortar can be increased by about -26% to 6%. At a dosage of 0.1% SAP and an entrained water-cement ratio of 0.06, the powdery SAP and the swelled SAP can reduce the mortar shrinkage rate by about 32.2% and 14.5%, respectively. Both the incorporation of powdery and swelled SAP has a positive effect on the freeze-thaw resistance of cement mortar. In particular, for powdery SAP with an entrained water-to-cement ratio of 0.06, the mass loss rate after 300 cycles is still lower than 5%.",Pharmacological Targeting of the ER-Resident Chaperones GRP94 or Cyclophilin B Induces Secretion of IL-22 Binding Protein Isoform-1 (IL-22BPi1).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108847,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Of the three interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) isoforms produced by the human IL22RA2 gene, IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3 are capable of neutralizing IL-22. The longest isoform, IL-22BPi1, does not bind IL-22, is poorly secreted, and its retention within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is associated with induction of an unfolded protein response (UPR). Therapeutic modulation of IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3 production may be beneficial in IL-22-dependent disorders. Recently, we identified the ER chaperones GRP94 and cyclophilin B in the interactomes of both IL-22BPi1 and IL-22BPi2. In this study, we investigated whether secretion of the IL-22BP isoforms could be modulated by pharmacological targeting of GRP94 and cyclophilin B, either by means of geldanamycin, that binds to the ADP/ATP pocket shared by HSP90 paralogs, or by cyclosporin A, which causes depletion of ER cyclophilin B levels through secretion. We found that geldanamycin and its analogs did not influence secretion of IL-22BPi2 or IL-22BPi3, but significantly enhanced intracellular and secreted levels of IL-22BPi1. The secreted protein was heterogeneously glycosylated, with both high-mannose and complex-type glycoforms present. In addition, cyclosporine A augmented the secretion of IL-22BPi1 and reduced that of IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3. Our data indicate that the ATPase activity of GRP94 and cyclophilin B are instrumental in ER sequestration and degradation of IL-22BPi1, and that blocking these factors mobilizes IL-22BPi1 toward the secretory route.",Effect of Nanobainite Content on the Dry Sliding Wear Behavior of an Al-Alloyed High Carbon Steel with Nanobainitic Microstructure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108846,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 21,"In this work, a multiphase microstructure consisting of nanobainte, martensite, undissolved spherical carbide, and retained blocky austenite has been prepared in an Al-alloyed high carbon steel. The effect of the amount of nanobainite on the dry sliding wear behavior of the steel is studied using a pin-on-disc tester with loads ranging from 25-75 N. The results show that, there is no significant differences in specific wear rate (SWR) for samples with various amounts of nanobainite when the normal load is 25 N. While, the SWR firstly decreases and then increases with increasing the amount of nanobainite, and the optimum wear resistance is obtained for samples with 60 vol.% nanobainite, when the applied load increases to 50 and 75 N. The improved wear resistance is attributed to the peak hardness increment resulted from the transformation of retained austenite to martensite, work hardening, along with amorphization and nanocrystallization of the worn surface. In addition, the highest toughness of the samples with 60 vol.% nanobainite is also proven to play a positive role in resisting sliding wear. EDS (energy dispersion spectrum) and XRD (X-ray diffraction) examinations reveal that the predominant failure mechanism is oxidative wear.",Involvement of Salicylic Acid in Anthracnose Infection in Tea Plants Revealed by Transcriptome Profiling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108845,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Anthracnose is a major leaf disease in tea plant induced by Colletotrichum, which has led to substantial losses in yield and quality of tea.

The number of differential expression genes (DEGs) detected between healthy and infected leaves was 1621 in LJ43 and 3089 in ZN139. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were highly enriched in catalytic activity, oxidation-reduction, cell-wall reinforcement, plant hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction. Further studies by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that expression of genes involved in endogenous salicylic acid biosynthesis and also accumulation of foliar salicylic acid are involved in the response of tea plant to anthracnose infection. This study firstly provided novel insight in salicylic acid acting as a key compound in the responses of tea plant to anthracnose disease. The transcriptome dataset in this study will facilitate to profile gene expression and metabolic networks associated with tea plant immunity against anthracnose.","Developing a Conceptual Framework for Environmental Health Tracking in Victoria, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108844,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"Victoria's (Australia) Environment Protection Authority (EPA), the state's environmental regulator, has recognized the need to develop an Environmental Health Tracking System (EHTS) to better understand environmental health relationships. To facilitate the process of developing an EHTS; a linkage-based conceptual framework was developed to link routinely collected environmental and health data to better understand environmental health relationships. This involved researching and drawing on knowledge from previous similar projects. While several conceptual frameworks have been used to organize data to support the development of an environmental health tracking system, Driving Force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) was identified as the most broadly applied conceptual framework. Exposure and effects are two important components of DPSEEA, and currently, exposure data are not available for the EHTS. Therefore, DPSEEA was modified to the Driving Force-Pressure-Environmental Condition-Health Impact-Action (DPEHA) conceptual framework for the proposed Victorian EHTS as there is relevant data available for tracking. The potential application of DPEHA for environmental health tracking was demonstrated through case studies. DPEHA will be a useful tool to support the implementation of Victoria's environmental health tracking system for providing timely and scientific evidence for EPA and other decision makers in developing and evaluating policies for protecting public health and the environment in Victoria.",Managers' Well-Being in the Digital Era: Is it Associated with Perceived Choice Overload and Pressure from Digitalization? An Exploratory Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108843,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"Due to the current digital transition, companies are under pressure to pursue digitalization and often initiate far-reaching transformation processes. As a result, managers must drive change within a company and are involved in important decision-making processes. In the present study, we focused on two cognitive job demands in managers related to change due to digital transformation: perceived choice overload and pressure from digitalization. We assumed that the extent of challenging cognitive demands at work is rising and negatively influencing managers' psychological well-being. We conducted an online survey with a sample of 368 upper-level managers from a large ICT-company, where, at the time of the study, extensive transformation processes were taking place. Using multivariate regression analysis, potential prognostic effects on well-being were tested. Results showed that lower well-being was significantly associated with higher choice overload, but not with perceived pressure from digitalization. In our explorative study, we investigated two potential job demands in managers that, to our knowledge, have not yet been scientifically tested. Given the unsettled state of the field, it is important to try to further understand when choice overload and pressure from digitalization occur and when these may trigger negative health consequences.",Eight Weeks of Inspiratory Muscle Training Improves Pulmonary Function in Disabled Swimmers-A Randomized Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108842,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 21,"According to the literature, inspiratory muscle fatigue may increase after swimming training (ST).

However, for gynecologic surgery, evidence is still scarce, especially if surgery is performed within enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and impact of preoperative weight loss in patients undergoing major gynecologic procedures within a standardized ERAS pathway between October 2013 and January 2017. Out of 339 consecutive patients, 33 (10%) presented significant unintentional preoperative weight loss of more than 5% during the 6 months preceding surgery. These patients were less compliant to the ERAS protocol (>70% of all items: 70% vs. 94%, p < 0.001) presented more postoperative overall complications (15/33 (45%) vs. 69/306 (22.5%), p = 0.009), and had an increased length of hospital stay (5 ± 4 days vs. 3 ± 2 days, p = 0.011). While patients experiencing weight loss underwent more extensive surgical procedures, after multivariate analysis, weight loss ≥5% was retained as an independent risk factor for postoperative complications (OR 2.44; 95% CI 1.00-5.95), and after considering several surrogates for extensive surgery including significant blood loss (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.15-4.31) as confounders. The results of this study suggest that systematic nutritional screening in ERAS pathways should be implemented.",Voluntary Activity Modulates Sugar-Induced Elastic Fiber Remodeling in the Alveolar Region of the Mouse Lung.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108840,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 21,"Diabetes and respiratory diseases are frequently comorbid conditions. However, the mechanistic links between hyperglycemia and lung dysfunction are not entirely understood. This study examined the effects of high sucrose intake on lung mechanics and alveolar septal composition and tested voluntary activity as an intervention strategy. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD, 7% sucrose) or a high sucrose diet (HSD, 35% sucrose). Some animals had access to running wheels (voluntary active; CD-A, HSD-A). After 30 weeks, lung mechanics were assessed, left lungs were used for stereological analysis and right lungs for protein expression measurement. HSD resulted in hyperglycemia and higher static compliance compared to CD. Lung and septal volumes were increased and the septal ratio of elastic-to-collagen fibers was decreased despite normal alveolar epithelial volumes. Elastic fibers appeared more loosely arranged accompanied by an increase in elastin protein expression. Voluntary activity prevented hyperglycemia in HSD-fed mice. The parenchymal airspace volume, but not the septal volume, was increased. The septal extracellular matrix (ECM) composition together with the protein expression of ECM components was similar to control levels in the HSD-A-group. In conclusion, HSD was associated with elastic fiber remodeling and reduced pulmonary elasticity. Voluntary activity alleviated HSD-induced ECM alterations, possibly by preventing hyperglycemia."

Formations of decadien-1-amine and 2-pentylpyridine were shown for the first time in potato chips. Frying oil had the highest concentration of 2,4-decadienal after thermal oxidation at 180 °C for 6 h. Expectedly, potato chips fried in this oil contained the highest concentration of 2,4-decadienal (29 mg/kg). There was a positive correlation (r2 = 0.73) between the concentrations of 2,4-decadienal and decadien-1-amine (relative concentration as peak area) formed in potato chips fried in repeatedly used sunflower oil. No 2-pentylpyridine was detected in potato chips fried in unoxidized oil, whereas its concentration ranged between 91 and 154 μg/kg in potato chips fried in oxidized oil. Acrylamide concentration of potato chips ranged between 525 μg/kg (fried in oxidized oil, 12 h) and 722 μg/kg (fried in unoxidized oil). A negative correlation (r2 = 0.70) was observed between the concentrations of 2,4-decadienal and acrylamide in potato chips. The results suggest that reactions of lipid derived carbonyls should be taken into account to understand better the modifcations of amino acids in fried products.",Effect of sodium caseinate and vitamin A complexation on bioaccessibility and bioavailability of vitamin A in Caco-2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108825,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Native sodium caseinate-vitamin A (VA) complexes (Sodium caseinate-VA complex, NaCaS-VA) and modified sodium caseinate-VA complexes i.e. Succinylated sodium caseinate-VA complex (SNaCaS-VA), reassembled sodium caseinate-VA complex (RNaCaS-VA) and reassembled succinylated sodium caseinate-VA complex (RSNaCaS-VA) were prepared and evaluated for their in-vitro bioaccessibility and in-vitro bioavailability of VA through Caco-2 cell lines.VA degraded under acidic conditions as the physiological pH during digestion in stomach was highly acidic (1.2-1.8). During in-vitro gastric digestion, sodium caseinate provided protection to VA, hence, higher VA content was retained in digesta as compared to free VA (oily form). Vitamin uptake by Caco-2 cells was significantly different for digested sodium caseinate-VA complexes as compared to free VA. The peptide content of casein and various sodium caseinate-VA complexes was monitored throughout digestion process. Variation in the complex composition had an effect on protein digestibility and peptide distribution. The bioavailability of VA through sodium caseinate-VA complexes was evaluated by exposing Caco-2 cells to the digesta of milk fortified with various complexes. The total uptake of VA by Caco-2 cells was highest for milk fortified with RSNaCaS-VA followed by RNaCaS-VA, control milk, SNaCaS-VA, NaCaS-VA and free VA. During the formation of RNaCaS-VA and RSNaCaS-VA complexes more hydrophobic sites are exposed, leading to the attachment of VA on the interior hydrophobic regions of sodium caseinate molecule. This led to higher stability of VA during gastrointestinal digestion and further resulted in higher bioaccessibility and bioavailability of vitamin A in Caco-2 cells.",Interactions between candelilla wax and saturated triacylglycerols in oleogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108823,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Fully hydrogenated oils or hardfats are low cost and highly available products used in lipid technology while candelilla wax (CLX) is a well-known oleogelator that has been thoroughly studied over the last decade. CLX is capable of making a strong oleogel when used in very low concentrations (~1.5%) while hardfats need to be added in higher concentrations (>10%) to form a gel. Based on the molecular similarity between hardfats and CLX the aim of this work is to evaluate the use of CLX and various hardfats in combination to form stable oleogels. The hardfats used in this study in combination with CLX were crambe (HCr), palm (HPl), palm kernel (HPk) and soybean (HSb). The total concentration of oleogelator used was 5% and soybean oil was used as the dispersing media. The proportions of 0:1, 0.25:0.75, 0.5:0.5, 0.75:0.25 and 1:0 of CLX:hardfats were studied. HPl and HCr fats formed a more stable and organized crystal network when used in all blends as shown by a shift towards to lower melting temperatures. However, G' and oil loss were close to CLX only when HPl was added in small amounts (0.25 and 0.5). The HSb fat presented similarity to CLX only for blend 0.25. HPk did not show any interaction with CLX due to the different triacylglycerol composition of this hardfat compared to the others. These results show that hardfats have the potential to be used in oleogel formulation especially when used in combination with CLX. The use of hardfats is attractive to producers since they are inexpensive and readily available and they can be used to reduce the total amount of CLX in food formulations avoiding the common waxy sensation associated with CLX formulations.","Cloning and expression of synthetic genes encoding native, hybrid- and bacteriocin-derived chimeras from mature class IIa bacteriocins, by Pichia pastoris (syn.

Synthetic genes encoding EntHF and EntCRL35 were also cloned in plasmid pP-αhSUMO3 for expression of the hSUMO3-fused bacteriocins by P. pastoris. Only recombinant P. pastoris expressing the bacteriocin-derived chimeras displayed a direct antimicrobial activity whereas P. pastoris X-33, producer of EntP::EntHF, showed the highest antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and in the multi-step chromatographic purified fractions. The MRM-ESI-LC-MS/MS (QTRAP) analysis of purified fractions from P. pastoris producers of hybrid- and bacteriocin-derived chimeras, permitted detection in the samples of peptides with the expected molecular mass of the bacteriocins produced. The antimicrobial activity of the EntP::EntHF chimera compared to that of the synthetic EntP::EntHF peptide, suggest that the biologically-produced bacteriocin-derived chimera shows a higher specific antimicrobial activity than its synthetic counterpart against different Listeria strains, including L. monocytogenes. More important, the N-terminal region of EntA and EntP seems to drive the production, processing and secretion of hybrid- and bacteriocin-derived chimeras, by P. pastoris X-33.",Chemical Composition and Antioxidant Activity of Monguba (Pachira aquatica) Seeds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108821,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Monguba fruit has a seed with a chestnut-like flavor that can be consumed boiled, fried, and roasted. These nutritious seeds also have been used in popular medicine to treat several diseases. Nevertheless, the nutritional and functional potential of monguba seed is still underexploited. In this sense, we investigated the nutritional and functional components of monguba seeds. These seeds showed high total content of sugars, mainly sucrose, whereas the content of the raffinose family oligosaccharides was low. The mineral assay showed high amount of minerals, namely potassium, calcium, magnesium and zinc, which indicate that monguba seeds can be a new source of these minerals. UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed caffeic, ferulic and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids as the main phenolic compounds, mainly in the esterified form, in these seeds. Monguba seed showed high lipid content, in which the main compounds were palmitic acid and γ-tocopherol. The soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions from monguba seeds showed high antioxidant activity measured by the oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) and the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays. Therefore, the monguba seeds have great potential to be explored by food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries due to their chemical composition.",Climate effects on physicochemical composition of Syrah grapes at low and high altitude sites from tropical grown regions of Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108820,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The major areas of the world where viticulture is practiced enjoy temperate or cool temperature climates. When wine grapes are grown in tropical regions, edaphoclimatic factors result in distinct grape quality attributes, and production techniques also require significant adjustment. The objective of this study was to characterize the chemical compositions, in particular of phenolic compounds, of Syrah grapes grown in two location in northeast Brazil - these are also at widely different altitudes. A range of methods of phenolic extraction were used, along with classical chemical analyses including for organic acids, sugars, monomeric anthocyanins, flavonols, stilbene, condensed tannins and some of the monomeric and small oligomeric procyanidins. The regions and their diverse environments had a larger influence than harvest year. The grapes at higher altitude (Bahia, 1.100 m asl (metres above sea level) were characterized by higher levels of malic acid, anthocyanins and condensed tannins in the skins. The low-altitude grapes (Pernambuco, 350 m asl (metres above sea level) had higher levels of glucose, fructose, 3-O-acetylglucoside anthocyanins and condensed tannins in the seeds. Fruit composition was highly influenced by the region. In the low-altitude region, the grapes were characterized by higher tartaric and citric acid in the must, also of flavonols in skins and of tannins in the seeds. Meanwhile, the fruit from the high altitude, contained higher levels of malic and succinic acid in the must, and of anthocyanins and condensed tannins in the skins.",Understanding the role of air and protein phase on mechanical anisotropy of calcium caseinate fibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108819,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Calcium caseinate dispersions can be transformed into anisotropic, fibrous materials using the concept of shear-induced structuring. The aim of this study is to further investigate the relative importance of air bubbles and protein on the mechanical anisotropy of calcium caseinate material. In this study, the effect of air on mechanical anisotropy of these fibrous materials was described with a load-bearing model, with the void fraction, and the bubble length and width as input parameters. The anisotropy of the protein phase was estimated using materials obtained from deaerated dispersions after shearing at different shear rates. We concluded that the deformation of air bubbles can only partly explain the mechanical anisotropy; the anisotropy of the protein phase is more important. Based on all results, we further concluded that the anisotropy of the protein phase was affected by the air bubbles present during the structuring process. This effect was explained by locally higher shear rate in the protein matrix during the structuring process.","Choosing a front-of-package warning label for Brazil: A randomized, controlled comparison of three different label designs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108818,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Warning labels (WLs) are the newest paradigm of nutrient-based, front-of-package labels (FOP) that have been consistently shown to be more effective at informing consumer purchases than other FOP labels.

Considering the meals consumed away from home, can the consumer identify the FBD risk level of the food that he/she consumes in restaurants? This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, risk perception, and optimistic bias of food handlers and consumers of restaurants and the relationship of these variables with the FBD risk of these establishments. Sixty-four handlers and 265 consumers of 14 restaurants in the city of Limeira - São Paulo, Brazil participated in the study. A validated checklist was used to evaluate the food safety profile of restaurants with a score ranging from zero to 2565.95. A structured questionnaire was employed to assess knowledge of food safety and the risk perception of FBD. The food handlers indicated their own risk and their peers' risk of causing a FBD. Consumers evaluated their own risk and the risk of their peers of contracting a FBD after making their own meals, consuming meals at the studied restaurants and consuming meals in other food establishments. The answers were based on a structured scale with seven options. The difference between their risk perception levels (risk attributed to itself and to a peer) indicated the optimistic bias of FBD risk. The mean food safety risk score of the food service establishments was 105.51. The restaurants were classified into two groups, higher or lower FBD risk. The mean score of knowledge (percentage of correct answers) of food safety was 61.7% for handlers and 59% for consumers, showing a nonsignificant difference (p = .29). Both food handlers and consumers stated that they were less at risk for FBD than their peers (p < .001). A direct effect of consumers' optimistic bias on food service FBD risk was observed through multivariate analysis. Optimistic bias may lead consumers to choose restaurants with a higher FDB risk. A direct negative effect of food handlers' knowledge of food service FBD risk was observed. These results show that consumers may have incorporated a sense of affection and identity to a place, associating it with making their own meals at home. Therefore, the consumer may not differentiate restaurants with regard to food safety. This result reinforces the need for governments and health agencies to protect the health of the population.",Restoring fresh texture in cooked aged rice with reducing agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108816,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Effects of ascorbic acid and sodium sulfite on texture of cooked aged rice were researched in this study. Hardness increase and stickiness reduction are common for cooked aged rice. The texture of cooked aged rice was significantly changed approaching to fresh rice by both reducing agents despite of sulfur-containing or not (p < 0.05), and the values of hardness, stickiness and stickiness/hardness ratio could be completely restored to the levels of the corresponding fresh rice. Moreover, this effect showed a dose-effect relationship. Morphology examination suggested that ascorbic acid made starch granules swelling adequately and full of larger dents in the interior of cooked aged rice, while sodium sulfite only made starch granules displayed relatively smaller dents. Particle size analysis indicated that ascorbic acid enhanced the swelling and separation of starch granules, but sodium sulfite only promoted the granule separation due to deagglomeration. Therefore, the two reducing agents are useful in restoring texture of aged rice to fresh rice through changing gelatinization behavior and can be as a key probe to disclose aging mechanisms of rice."

The same approach was then used to discriminate EVOO samples from different geographical origins, namely six blends representative of the main growing regions in Italy (i.e., Sicily, Puglia, Umbria, Liguria, Lombardy and Tuscany). This approach allowed to putatively identify >1000 compounds, considering both polyphenols and sterols. The unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and the orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) discriminated EVOO samples according to both cultivar and geographical origin. In particular, flavonoids (i.e., anthocyanins and flavonols), hydroxycinnamic acids and cholesterol derivatives were found to be the most representative classes of compounds discriminating EVOO samples according to the two parameters (cultivar or geographical origin) selected. However, the following Venn analysis allowed to point out the discriminant markers being exclusive for cultivar or origin discrimination. In this regard, only the 9.6% of phenolics and 13.6% of sterols were in common, thus indicating that several of these discriminant compounds were exclusive of a single condition. Indeed, considering that most of the commercial EVOOs are blended, the contribution of both the cultivars used and the geographical origin must be taken into account.",Formation of Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine and Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine during black tea processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108804,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"This study selected common processing methods for orthodox black tea and investigated changes in the levels of Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), lysine, and polyphenols during each processing stage and using different parameters of each processing step. The effects of epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and gallic acid on the levels of CML, CEL, fructoselysine, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal were investigated by chemical model systems study under black tea processing conditions. In tea samples, CML and CEL levels significantly increased during drying (could reach 51.8 and 8.7 μg/g tea, respectively), while natural withering and extensive rolling and fermentation times facilitated the formation of CML and CEL by altering the substrate concentrations and the cellular structure of tea leaves to be dried. The results of model systems (containing lysine, glucose, and fructose) indicated that polyphenols were able to enhance the production of CML and CEL, and the levels of CML and CEL increased 1.2-3.2- and 1.6-3.5-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the main pathways responsible for CML and CEL formation during black tea processing likely involve fructoselysine and others but not glyoxal or methylglyoxal.",HS-SPME-GC-MS technique for FFA and hexanal analysis in different cheese packaging in the course of long term storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108803,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The present study sought to develop a headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to quantify free fatty acids (FFAs) and hexanal in cheese, and to track theirs levels over time.

The quantification results indicated that 19 compounds including (Z)-3-hexenol, 1-octen-3-ol, linalool, phenylethyl alcohol, hexanal, benzeneacetaldehyde, limonene, heptanoic acid, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, acetate, benzyl alcohol, trans-linalool oxide (furanoid), hotrienol, 1-octen-3-one, 2-nonanone, (E)-2-octenal, nonanal, β-myrcene, 2-pentylfuran, and methylpyrazine were identified as the key compounds with odor activity values (OAVs) higher than 1.0 in the world's four most famous black teas. Notably, the comparison of GC-O and OAV calculation results showed that methyl salicylate (Ceylon), (E)-2-octenal (Assam), benzeneacetaldehyde (Keemun) and linalool and trans-linalool oxide (furanoid) (Darjeeling) might be the most definitive odorants in the corresponding tea categories.",Survey of mislabelling across finfish supply chain reveals mislabelling both outside and within Canada.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108801,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Seafood has become one of the most heavily traded food commodities in the era of globalization. International seafood supply chains are complex and contend with many difficulties in bringing an enormous variety of products to market. A major challenge involves accurately labelling products such that they comply with a diverse set of regulatory frameworks, ranging from country-of-origin through to the final point of consumer sale. Thanks to DNA barcoding, seafood mislabelling is now recognized as a global problem, with potentially negative impacts on human health, economy and the environment. Mislabelling can result from species misidentification, use of inappropriate common names, incomplete and/or out-dated regulatory frameworks, or through market substitution. While prior studies have focused primarily on retail and food service establishments, this study used barcoding to assess rates of finfish mislabelling at multiple points in the supply chain within Ontario, Canada. A total of 203 specimens from 12 key targeted species were collected from varied importers, registered processing plants and retailers in Southern Ontario and identified using DNA barcoding. Species identity of samples was used to assess conformity of labelling against the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) Fish List, which revealed an overall mislabelling rate of 32.3% among targeted species. The mislabelling rate was significantly different between samples collected from importers and retailers. Among the mislabelled samples were seven samples that originated from US and were properly labelled according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Seafood List. This study evaluated the integrity of chain of custody documents and identified discrepancies in 43 samples (21.4%). Implementing seafood traceability throughout the supply chain and harmonizing labelling regulations between countries can help to ensure industry compliance in a globalized market, while sampling at multiple points in the supply chain can help to reveal causes.",Chemical composition and bioactive properties of the wild edible plant Raphanus raphanistrum L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108800,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Recently, there has been an interest regarding the consumption of wild edible plants in modern diets. However, there is still scarce information about several wild vegetables traditionally consumed. Therefore, this work aims on documenting the nutritional and chemical composition of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.), as well as its bioactive potential. Results showed that wild radish is a potential source of beneficial compounds, including vitamin E, polyunsaturated fatty acid (particularly α-linolenic acid) and different phenolic compounds, in which fourteen phenolics were identified, with kaempferol-3,7-O-di-rhamnoside being the most abundant. The bioactive potential was exploited using hydroethanolic and decoction extracts. Both proved to inhibit several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and revealed antioxidant activity, while cytotoxicity against non-tumor cell was not observed. In general, results evidence the interest in recovering the use of this wild vegetable as part of a varied diet, which can bring several health benefits.",Mathematical modelling of anthocyanin mass transfer to predict extraction in simulated red wine fermentation scenarios.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108799,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Anthocyanins are polyphenolic compounds present in grapes that are responsible for the initial colour of red wine and their incorporation into derived pigments leads to long term colour stability. The ability to predict the effect of process variables, either controlled by winemakers or that naturally change throughout fermentation, on the extraction of anthocyanins is vital to producing red wine of high quality. A 23 factorial experiment with additional points located at central factor conditions was used to determine the impact of temperature, sugar and ethanol concentrations on the mass transfer properties of anthocyanins from fresh Pinot noir grape solids. Factor conditions were chosen to replicate ethanol and sugar concentrations that would be found in a 14% red wine and its respective unfermented juice. A previously described mathematical model was applied to anthocyanin extraction curves to determine mass transfer coefficients and distribution constants for the generation of response surface models able to predict these mass transfer variables for dynamic fermentation scenarios. The coefficient of determination for the model solution exceeded 0.94 in all cases, demonstrating a good agreement between experimental and mathematically-derived anthocyanin concentrations. Following this, simulations of anthocyanin extraction under fermentation conditions were conducted using a previously developed wine fermentation model allowing for the prediction of extraction rates and anthocyanin concentrations under various winemaking scenarios. The extraction simulations predicted a previously observed but so far undescribed anthocyanin extraction pattern during fermentation.",Characterization of three different classes of non-fermented teas using untargeted metabolomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108798,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Non-fermented teas, which are widely consumed in China, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere, have refreshing flavors and valuable health benefits. Various types of non-fermented teas look and taste similar and have no obvious differences in appearance, making their classification challenging. To date, there are very few reports about characterization and discrimination of different types of non-fermented teas. To characterize non-fermented teas and build a standard model for their classification based on their chemical composition, we employed multi-platform-based metabolomics to analyze primary and secondary metabolites in three main categories of non-fermented teas (green, yellow, and white), using 96 samples collected from China. Five hundred and ninety unique tea metabolites were identified and quantified in these three types of teas. Moreover, a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was established based on metabolomics data, in order to classify non-fermented teas into these three classes. Furthermore, our results speculate that the health benefits (e.g., antioxidant content) of these three types of non-fermented tea differ primarily because of variation in their metabolic components (e.g., ascorbate, vitexin).","Novel process of hydration, followed by incubation and thermal processing, for high isoflavone bioconversion in soybeans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108797,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The potentially bioavailable aglyconic isoflavone content of soybeans was increased by a process based on the controlled hydration of whole beans, followed by an incubation step and cooking. For developing the process, the effects of three operation variables: temperature, intermittent soaking and incubation time on the isoflavone profile of the processed soybeans were assessed. By hydrating the whole beans under controlled conditions (54 °C; 15 rpm for a rotating soaking basket) and holding the beans for an appropriate incubation time, it was possible to substantially increase the total aglycone content from (μmol·10-2·g-1) ~5 in the raw, to ~95 in the processed soybean. A conventional thermal treatment (1 kg⋅cm-2, 5 min), necessary to attain the nutritional and sensory characteristics, produced additional hydrolysis of glucosides, accounting for extra 14% of total aglycone yield. The entire process avoided the need to grind the bean and permitted an overall 21.8-fold increase (per-mole basis) conversion of all forms of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones, particularly to the (S)-equol precursor, daidzein, and with minimal back-diffusion or leaching to the outside medium.","Effect of endogenous phenoloxidase on protein solubility and digestibility after processing of Tenebrio molitor, Alphitobius diaperinus and Hermetia illucens.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108796,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Upon extracting soluble proteins from insects as potential food ingredient, endogenous enzymes, such as phenoloxidases, are expected to negatively affect protein properties. The effect of phenoloxidases on solubility and digestibility of proteins was investigated for larvae of Tenebrio molitor, Alphitobius diaperinus and Hermetia illucens. Phenoloxidase inhibition was done using blanching (50 s, 90 °C) before extraction or extracting in presence of sulfite. Similar soluble protein yields and compositions were found without and with sulfite addition, whereas blanching decreased soluble protein yield. Upon in-vitro hydrolysis by pepsin and trypsin, soluble proteins from H. illucens were more digestible than those of T. molitor and A. diaperinus. Phenoloxidase activity during grinding negatively affected in-vitro pepsin hydrolysis. Besides phenoloxidase activity, also endogenous proteases were shown to remain active at pH 8 in extracts containing sulfite and after blanching of larvae. This stresses that protease activity needs to be carefully controlled in the design of insect based ingredients."

Phenolic compounds are the main biosynthesized metabolites of this system response. Our objective in this investigation was to evaluate the induction of specific metabolic pathways using chitosan as an elicitor. Extracts obtained from avocado in intermediate and consumption maturity stages treated with chitosan exhibited an increase in antifungal activity, which caused inhibition of mycelial growth and a decrease in sporulation as well as spore germination of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Additionally, RNA from epicarp of the fruits treated and untreated with chitosan was obtained in order to evaluate the expression of genes related to phenylpropanoids and the antifungal compound 1-acetoxy-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-heneicosa-12,15-diene biosynthesis. An increased in gene expression of genes that participates in the phenylpropanoids route was observed during the stage of physiological fruit maturity, others genes such as Flavonol synthase (Fls), increased only in samples obtained from fruit treated with chitosan at consumption maturity. Our results reveal a new molecular mechanism where chitosan induces a specific accumulation of phenylpropanoids and antifungal diene; this partially explains avocado's resistance against fungal pathogens. Finally, we discuss the molecular connections between chitosan induction and gene expression to explain the biological events that orchestrate the resistance pathways in fruits.",Characterisation of the bioactive properties and microstructure of chickpea protein-based oil in water emulsions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108784,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Legumes, such as chickpea, represent a good source of high quality proteins for which there is an increasing global consumer demand. A chickpea protein concentrate (CP) was generated by isoelectric precipitation. Protein determination, electrophoretic and gel permeation chromatographic analysis revealed that the order of CP solubility was pH 7.5 > 2.5 > 5.0. Sunflower oil in water (O/W) emulsions were generated with the CP at pH 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5. Microstructural evaluation of the emulsions using laser light-scattering particle size analysis, optical microscopy and rheological analysis showed that smaller droplet size (3.1 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.1 μm) and the highest elastic moduli (876.0 ± 3.2 and 563.5 ± 6.5 Pa) were obtained in those emulsions generated with CP at pH 2.5 and 7.5. The ferric reducing (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values of the CP emulsions ranged from 194.5 ± 19.2 to 242.4 ± 8.4 μmol Trolox Eq·g-1 CP for FRAP at pH 2.5 and 5.0, respectively, and from 313.2 ± 2.6 to 369.0 ± 1.6 μmol Trolox eq·g-1 CP for ORAC at pH 5.0 and 2.5, respectively. The enzyme inhibitory activity of the emulsions was generally low irrespective of the pH value (c.a. 3 and 30% inhibition for dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, respectively). Simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) of the emulsions significantly decreased their FRAP whereas it increased their ORAC values as well as their ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory activities irrespective of the pH value of the CP. These results demonstrate the potential application of reduced fat CP-stabilized emulsions for the provision of antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities.",Wild Brazilian species of Eugenia genera (Myrtaceae) as an innovation hotspot for food and pharmacological purposes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108783,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The Myrtaceae is one of the most common plant families in Brazil, including >1000 species of native fruit spread from North to South, where around 50% of all species are endemic to the Atlantic Rain Forest Biome. Most Brazilian species belong to Eugenia, Campomanesia, Psidium and Myrciaria genera. In general, they are characterized by the presence of leaves opposite, simple, entire, with pellucid glands containing ethereal oils and produces berry-like, fleshy fruits with a wide diversity of beneficial characteristics. Several parts of these plants are widely used in regional folk medicine as an astringent, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, to treat gastrointestinal disorders, and so on. Some species have already been studied and most of their metabolic effects are attributed to the presence of polyphenols, carotenoids as well as sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. In addition, the Myrtaceae family has great economic potential, because of the sensory characteristics which encourages their commercial exploitation plus the presence of phytochemicals which play an important role in managing several degenerative chronic diseases besides representing a hotspot of technological innovation for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes. In this context, this review discusses about the importance of some Eugenia genera representatives such as Eugenia uniflora, Eugenia stipitata, Eugenia brasiliensis, Eugenia pyriformis and Eugenia dysenterica, emphasizing its profile of bioactive compounds as well as the knowledge of the nutritional and functional fruit potential, providing information for further studies aiming to stimulate the cultivation of Brazilian wild berries, for consumption and new food ingredients.",Spoilage microbial community profiling by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of modified atmosphere packaged live mussels stored at 4oC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108782,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"There is little information on the microbial communities associated with modified atmosphere (MA)-packaged live mussels. There is also a dearth of information on how pre-packaging depuration modifies the microbial communities and spoilage of live mussels. Amplicon sequencing was used to describe spoilage microbial succession in MA-packaged live mussels during storage at 4 °C. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes were the three major phyla observed in the mussel meat and pouch water of undepurated and depurated mussels. Among these phyla, Cyanobacteria was more predominant on day 0 in mussel meat of undepurated and depurated mussels while Proteobacteria was predominant in commercially-depurated mussels. Synechococcus was apparently dominant on days 0-7 in the meat of undepurated mussels and days 0-10 in depurated mussels. Shewanella was dominant on day 0 in commercially-depurated mussels and dominant on day 15 in undepurated while Acidaminococcus was dominant in depurated mussels on day 15. Psychromonas was observed to be dominant in commercially-depurated mussels on day 7 and further shifted to Acinetobacter by day 10 and 15. In the pouch water, Acinetobacter was dominant throughout the storage days in undepurated mussels while Psychrobacter was predominant in both depurated and commercially-depurated mussels. This study demonstrated the impact of depuration on the microbiota and the spoilage mechanism of MA-packaged live mussels. Shewanella was easily removed through depuration. However, spoilage bacteria such as Acidaminococcus could not be easily removed although they are not important at the beginning but grew at the end. Pouch water contributed suitable biological medium for the growth of Acinetobacter and Psychrobacter and both enhanced the growth of spoilage bacteria such as Shewanella and Acidaminococcus.",Flour from mature Prosopis nigra pods as suitable substrate for the synthesis of prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides and stabilization of dehydrated Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108781,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Prosopis nigra, a sucrose-rich crop, was used to enzymatically synthesize fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). The obtained products were used as stabilizing matrices during freeze-drying and storage of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CIDCA 333. The centesimal composition of P. nigra flour was firstly determined. FOS were synthesized using Viscozyme L as biocatalyst. The progress of the enzymatic reaction was monitored by HPLC and compared with a reaction carried out using equivalent concentrations of pure sucrose as substrate (control). Then, P. nigra containing or not the obtained FOS (P. nigra + FOS or P. nigra) were used as matrices for freeze-drying and storage of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CIDCA 333. P. nigra flour was rich in simple sugars (sucrose and fructose), total dietary fiber, and polyphenols. The main products of synthesis were FOS with degrees of polymerization (DP) within 3 and 5, and these results were comparable with those of the controls. DP3 was the first product obtained, attaining the maximal production after 1.29 hours of synthesis. The maximal production of total FOS (DP3 + DP4 + DP5) was achieved after 2.57 hours, indicating that larger FOS (DP4, DP5) were produced from DP3. Glucose was obtained as secondary product, but with significantly lower Vmax and Kf (maximal velocity for the production and constant for the formation) than DP3. Both P. nigra + FOS or P. nigra matrices stabilized the highly sensitive L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CIDCA 333 strain during freeze-drying and storage for up to 140 days at 4 °C, and were significantly better protectants than the controls of sucrose (p <0.05). The concomitant presence of prebiotics (FOS), antioxidants (polypyhenols) and lactic acid bacteria in the matrices provides a smart strategy to increase the value of this underutilized regional crop, turning it in an interesting ingredient potentially useful in the food industry.","Comparison assessment between SIM and MRM mode in the analysis of 3-MCPD ester, 2-MCPD ester and glycidyl ester.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108780,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The detection of 3- and 2-MCPD ester and glycidyl ester was transformed from selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode to multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode by gas chromatography triple quadrupole spectrometry. The derivatization process was adapted from AOCS method Cd 29a-13. The results showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) of all detected compounds obtained from both detection mode was comparable, which falls between 0.997 and 0.999. The limit of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) were improved in MRM mode as compared to SIM mode. In MRM mode, the LOD of 3- and 2-MCPD ester was achieved 0.01 mg/kg while the LOQ was 0.05 mg/kg. Besides, LOD and LOQ of glycidyl ester were 0.024 and 0.06 mg/kg respectively. A blank spiked with MCPD esters (0.03, 0.10 and 0.50 mg/kg) and GE (0.06, 0.24 and 1.20 mg/kg) were chosen for repeatability and recovery tests. MRM mode showed better repeatability in area ratio and recovery with relative standard deviation (RSD %) < 5% for 2-, 3-MCPD ester at 0.5 mg/kg and GE at 1.2 mg/kg. Quantification of 22 food samples from different category were performed by repeated injections in both detection modes. Briefly, the contaminants from crude palm oil, mustard and olive oil were present in minute amount which below the LOD or LOQ in both detection modes. Sample from chocolate and infant formula products showed certain level of MCPD esters and GE, and their detection was more precisely quantitated based on MRM mode. Besides, margarine products showed a higher level of contaminations due to the high fat content in these products. MRM mode detection was proven to provide precise data with low RSD % in different food matrices. MRM mode detection was robust and selective for MCPD esters and GE analyses, it should be applied to determine the concentration of MCPD esters and GE contaminations in food.",Release of anthocyanins from the hibiscus extract encapsulated by ionic gelation and application of microparticles in jelly candy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108779,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Microparticles containing anthocyanin extract from Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

The gut microbiota is involved in the host energy metabolism through the regulation of body fat storage, and a link between diet, FFA and the intestinal microbiota seems to exist. Our aim was to explore the interaction among serum FFA levels, gut microbiota, diet and obesity through a model regression tree in 66 subjects (age 52.7 ± 11.2 y) classified according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Total and individual FFA were analyzed by colorimetric enzymatic assay and methyl-tert-butylether-based extraction protocol (MTBE), respectively. Microbiota was determined by qPCR and diet through a food frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, and predictive factors for obesity were obtained via classification by decision trees using machine learning methods. An obese-linked FFA profile was characterized by decreased eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and increased linoleic, gamma-linolenic and palmitic acids levels simultaneously. Serum EPA and gender were identified as the most significant variables with 100% and 80% of importance, respectively. Palmitic acid, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium explained >30%, followed by Bacteroides group with 20% and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) almost with 15% of importance. Also, the regression tree model obtained for predicting obesity, showed a non-obese-linked profile, independently of gender, with serum EPA > 0.235 μg/mL and Bacteroides > 9.055 log n° cells per g of feces. Moreover, Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium seemed to play an important role by complementing the levels of FFA in predicting obesity in males and females, respectively.",Characterisation of the in vitro bioactive properties of alkaline and enzyme extracted brewers' spent grain protein hydrolysates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108777,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Brewer's spent grain (BSG) is a co-product of the brewing industry that has been shown to contain a range of bioactive peptides encrypted within its protein sequences. Two methods were evaluated herein to generate bioactive peptides; (i) an alkaline extracted BSG protein rich fraction (BSG-PI) was hydrolysed using different combinations of proteolytic enzymes and (ii) BSG was pre-treated with carbohydrases followed by direct hydrolysis using proteolytic enzymes (BSG-DH). BSG-DH with Alcalase/Flavourzyme resulted in significantly higher (p < .05) protein yield when compared to BSG-PI (63.09 ± 0.27 and 58.90 ± 1.45%, respectively). The antioxidant activities (ORAC, FRAP and ABTS) of the BSG-PI and -DH hydrolysates differed depending on the assay and proteolytic enzyme combination preparations used for hydrolysis. Inhibition of DPP-IV by the BSG-PI hydrolysates ranged from 87.01 ± 0.15 to 89.61 ± 0.12% while inhibition by the BSG-DH hydrolysates ranged from 35.71 ± 0.72 to 85.06 ± 0.17%. A significant reduction in the release of interleukin-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was observed following treatment with BSG-PI hydrolysates generated with Prolyve/Protease P (58.30 ± 13.76%) and Corolase PP/Flavourzyme (48.02 ± 10.82%) when compared to untreated LPS stimulated control cells (100%). BSG-DH hydrolysates were subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) which resulted in a reduction in antioxidant activity, an increase in DPP-IV inhibition and no change in the immunomodulatory activity. Ultrafiltration of selected BSG-DH hydrolysates (through 30 and 10 kDa membranes) gave some permeates with enhanced bioactivities. The results demonstrate that direct enzymatic hydrolysis of BSG is a feasible approach for the generation of bioactive peptides without the prior use of an alkali protein extraction step.",Effect of home cooking on the antioxidant capacity of vegetables: Relationship with Maillard reaction indicators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108776,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Vegetables are health-promoting foods due to their content on a wide range of phytochemicals, being involved in antioxidant protection. However, such bioactivity can be modified during cooking and also along the digestion-fermentation process. Thus, the aim of the paper is to establish a relation among the type of processing (raw, boiled, steamed, grilled, roasted, and fried), time of processing (raw, usual time and well-done), antioxidant capacity and the development of the Maillard reaction (measured though the analysis of furosine and HMF) of 23 widely consumed vegetables. Antioxidant capacity was measured with three methods (TEACABTS, TEACFRAP, TEACOH) after submitting vegetables to an in vitro digestion followed by and in vitro fermentation process. Furosine and HMF were useful indicators to control both cooking time and heat intensity of common vegetables, being correlated with antioxidant capacity. Those samples cooked with aggressive techniques (frying, grilling or breading) showed the higher antioxidant values."

The FVR flour was divided in three fractions, according to their granulometric distribution: A (425-500 μm), B (212-300 μm) and C (<150 μm). FVR presented heterogeneous particle size distribution and fibrous structure showing granular compounds adhered to the surface. The fiber contents decreased according to granulometry, whereas the protein content increased. The films obtained from FVR were malleable, homogeneous, yellowish, and presented high solubility (90%). The granulometry reduction and the pectin addition have significantly improved the viscosity and the yellow color of the film solutions (FS). There was decrease of solubility (50%) and improvement of the mechanical properties of the pectin-based films: decrease of elongation (16-30%) and increase of tensile strength (2.88 ± 0.79 MPa). The sorption isotherms of the pectin-FVR films evidenced the lower availability of polar groups able to work as water-sorption sites. Therefore, different residue fractions could have different applications depending on their particle size and composition, either as source of dietary fibers (the thickest fractions) or as raw material for film production.",Effect of domestic cooking methods on protein digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility of wild harvested adult edible insects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108764,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Wild harvested edible insects are characterised by high protein and mineral contents with potential to contribute substantially to nutrition security. However, nutritional content is only beneficial when proteins are digestible and minerals bioaccessible. This study determined the effects of domestic processing on protein digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility of two wild harvested insect species: Eulepida mashona (beetle) and Henicus whellani (cricket). Samples of both insects were subjected to boiling, roasting, or combined boiling and roasting, imitating the way insects are traditionally prepared in Zimbabwe. Moreover, they were in vitro digested according to INFOGEST protocol. Boiling of both insects resulted in loss of protein as it leached into the boiling water. The raw insects had a higher protein in vitro digestibility than the boiled and roasted insects, and the maximal decrease in protein digestibility was around 25% for twice boiling of the beetles and for boiled and roasted crickets. For both insect species, boiling resulted in non-significant loss of iron and zinc. Iron was the least bioaccessible mineral in both insects, based on the concentrations of soluble mineral measured by ICP-AES. However, beetles had a much higher iron bioaccessibility (30.7%) as compared to crickets (8.11%). Interestingly, boiling resulted in about 50% decrease in iron and zinc bioaccessibility in both species while roasting did not. The reduced protein digestibility and mineral accessibility with processing can be explained by protein modification and interactions of minerals with other food components, such as chitin and phytochemicals. Because of the reduction in protein digestibility and mineral accessibility during boiling, roasting should be favoured over boiling and in any case short boiling time is recommended.",Structure of gellan gum-hydrolyzed collagen particles: Effect of starch addition and coating layer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108763,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"In this work, we developed biopolymeric structures, based on electrostatic attraction, through dripping gellan gum into hydrolyzed collagen (HC), to deliver hydrophilic compounds. Moreover, we evaluated the influence of starch addition on the polymeric network as well as the coating effects promoted by an outer gellan layer. The lowest tested gellan gum concentration in the core (0.5% w/w) was the best one to build spherical beads, with high retention of bioactives (>84% for anthocyanin and >68% for HC). Moreover, the minimum HC concentration (2.5% w/w) in the gelling bath allowed the saturation of active sites of gellan gum presented in the core, as regardless of the HC concentration in the peptide bath, particles presented the same amount of adsorbed peptide. Starch disturbed the interactions between HC and gellan, increasing porosity and pore size, but it presented an important role in retaining anthocyanin in the particle's core. Finally, we demonstrated that addition of a gellan coating layer affected the structure of beads: Peptide molecules (positively charged), already adsorbed onto the beads, diffused out of the core, attracted by the negatively charged gellan coating layer. Consequently, it decreased particle size and increased pore size in the outer part of the particles, which was associated with a reduction in the retention of bioactives. These findings bring important contributions to particle engineering: A new process for particle production was proposed, in which hydrogels were produced by dripping the polysaccharide into the protein bath to be externally gelled, without previous crosslinking with salts.",Temporal sweetness and side tastes profiles of 16 sweeteners using temporal check-all-that-apply (TCATA).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108762,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"An increase in consumer awareness around the negative health impacts of consuming excess added sugars has led to a rise in the replacement of sucrose in foods and beverages. This replacement is often through the use of low or no calorie sweeteners to reduce total calories while maintaining sweetness and palatability. There are a wide variety of sweeteners with diverse physical and caloric compositions which can be used at concentrations estimated to be equi-sweet to sucrose in food products. However, many of the available sweeteners are known to differ in their temporal profiles and may have other side and aftertastes alongside sweetness that need to be considered when comparing their suitability as potential sucrose substitutes. The objective of the current study was to profile and compare the temporal sweetness and qualitative differences of 15 sweeteners to sucrose across nutritive saccharide (sucrose, dextrose, fructose, allulose (D-psicose), palatinose (isomaltulose), sucrose-allulose mixture), nutritive polyol (maltitol, erythritol, mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol) and non-nutritive (acesulfame-k, aspartame, sucralose, stevia (rebaudioside-A or rebA), luo han guo (monk fruit extract or mogroside)) groups, at equi-sweet intensity to 10% w/v sucrose based on a previous psychophysical dose-response study. Using the Temporal Check-all-that-Apply (TCATA) method, 20 participants evaluated a set of 17 sweetener samples (including a sucrose duplicate) in triplicates across three 1-h sessions for the occurrence of six attributes (sweetness, bitterness, metallic taste, chemical taste, honey taste and mouth-drying) over a 60 s period. Sucrose was characterised by a rapid sweetness onset (within first 10 s) to peak citation, and subsequent decay of sweetness with minimal side tastes noted. Acesulfame-K, stevia (rebA) and luo han guo had prominent and long-lasting citations of the undesirable bitter, metallic and chemical side tastes and significantly lower sweetness citations. Allulose, erythritol, sorbitol, aspartame and sucralose were perceived to have bitter, metallic and chemical side tastes, but retained a largely sweet taste profile, with longer residual sweetness for aspartame and sucralose. Nutritive sweeteners dextrose, fructose, maltitol, mannitol, sucrose-allulose mixture, palatinose and xylitol had the most similar temporal and qualitative taste profiles when compared to sucrose, in terms of their sweetness onset, peak sweetness citations, sweetness decay, and side taste profiles.",Number of consumers and days of display necessary for the assessment of meat colour acceptability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108761,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Visual assessment is regarded as the gold standard to evaluate meat colour shelf-life, but it is costly and time consuming. To address this issue, this paper aims to evaluate the number of consumers and days of display that are necessaries in order to assess the colour shelf-life of meat, presented with different methods, all using images. Photographs of thirty-six lamb steaks were taken just after cutting (day 0) and on each of the following days until the 14th day of display under standardized conditions. Images were presented in three different manners: 1) with days of display and animals in random order (Random); 2) days of display in sequential and animals in random order (Sequential); and, 3) days of display and animals in sequential order (Animal); they were presented to 211 consumers who evaluated visual acceptability on a 9-point scale. At day zero, visual acceptability scores were the highest in Animal, followed by Sequential, and then by the Random (P < .05) method. Scores decreased over time for all methods tested (P < .05). The Random method presented the highest standard deviation; however, an increase in standard deviation among consumers along days of display was observed for all methods tested (P < .05). Shelf-life determined by regression varied according to the method of presentation (7.83, 7.00 and 7.54 days for Random, Sequential and Animal, respectively). A minimum number of 4 day points before and 4 day points after neutral scores had been reached (scores = 5.0) were necessary in order to obtain a robust model. The minimum number of required consumers (α = 0.05; d = 0.1 and β = 0.2 or 0.1) varied according to methodology: it was 81 to 109 consumers for Random, 69 to 92 for Sequential, and 55 to 74 for Animal. Our study indicates that an optimal number of days and evaluators can be calculated depending on the manner of sample presentation. These findings should be taken into account in further studies that aim to balance data reliability with the cost involved in meat colour analyses.",Volatile compounds associated with growth of Asaia bogorensis and Asaia lannensis-unusual spoilage bacteria of functional beverages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108760,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Acetic acid bacteria of the genus Asaia are recognized as common bacterial spoilage in the beverage industry. Their growth in contaminated soft drinks can be visible in the form of flocs, turbidity and flavor changes. Volatile profiles associated with the growth and metabolic activities of Asaia lannensis and As. bogorensis strains were evaluated using comprehensive gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToF MS). Based on obtained results, 33 main compounds were identified. The greatest variety of volatile metabolites was noted for As. lannensis strain W4. 2-Phenylethanol, 3-pentanone, 2-nonanol, 2-hydroxy-3-pentanone, and 2-nitro-1-butanol were detected as dominant volatile compounds. Additionally, As. lannensis strains formed 2-propenoic acid ethyl ester. As. bogorensis ISD1 was distinguished by the higher concentration of 2-hydroxy-3-pentanone and 3-methyl-1-butene but the lowest concentration of 2-phenylethanol. Based on these results, it was found that volatile profiles of Asaia spp. are unique among acetic acid bacteria. Moreover, obtained profiles depended not only on bacterial species and strains but also on the composition of culture media.","Fermented Momordica charantia L. juice modulates hyperglycemia, lipid profile, and gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108759,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum-fermentation on the anti-diabetic functionality of Momordica charantia was examined using a high-fat-diet and low-dose streptozocin-induced type 2 diabetic rat model. Fermented Momordica charantia juice (FMCJ) administration mitigated the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and oxidative stress in diabetic rats more favorably than the non-fermented counterpart. Treatments with FMCJ improved ergosterols and lysomonomethyl-phosphatidylethanolamines metabolisms more effectively. Supplement of FMCJ regulated the composition of the gut microbiota, such as increased the abundance of Bacteroides caecigallinarum, Oscillibacter ruminantium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella oralis, and Prevotella melaninogenica, in diabetic rats compared with untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, FMCJ-treated diabetic rats exhibited higher concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, total short-chain fatty acids and lower pH values in colonic contents than that in non-fermented juice-treated rats. These results demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum-fermentation enhanced the anti-diabetic property of MC juice by favoring the regulation of gut microbiota and the production of SCFAs.",DHA and EPA nanoemulsions prepared by the low-energy emulsification method: Process factors influencing droplet size and physicochemical stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108758,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"To extend the application of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in liquid food, and to improve the physicochemical stability, we prepared stable DHA and EPA nanoemulsions, which can be used for large scale production. The Emulsion Phase Inversion (EPI) method was used to prepare nanoemulsions as safe and convenient with low-energy emulsification method. The type of oil, the type of surfactant and the concentration of surfactant have the most significant effect on particle size. Within 20 days, the nanoemulsions have good physical stability under different storage conditions, and the retention rate of DHA/EPA can be stabilized at >60%. Furthermore, different types of natural antioxidants were added and the effect was detected by analyzing the peroxide value. Among them, tea polyphenols showed the most significant effect. The data obtained showed enhanced nanoemulsions stability, increased application in food and actual large-scale production.",Effect of co-culture with Tetragenococcus halophilus on the physiological characterization and transcription profiling of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108757,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus are widely existed and play vital roles during the manufacture of fermented foods such as soy sauce. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the volatile compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic acid which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic acid produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane fatty acid showed that co-culture improved the content of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation, energy metabolism, and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii. Results presented in this study may contribute to further understand the interactions between Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus.",Intracellular antioxidant activity and apoptosis inhibition capacity of PEF-treated KDHCH in HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108756,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on the intracellular antioxidant and apoptotic activity of the peptide Lys-Asp-His-Cys-His (KDHCH) was examined using model HepG2 cells. First, PEF treatment conditions specific for the antioxidant peptide were optimized, and it was found that PEF treatment could enhance DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of KDHCH. Second, KDHCH subjected to PEF treatment at 1800 Hz and 15 kV/cm was investigated using various intracellular antioxidant assays. PEF treatment decreased the EC50 value and increased the protective ability of oxidative stress inhibition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity of KDHCH. Furthermore, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities of KDHCH-pre-treated HepG2 cells increased significantly compared with those of the H2O2 damaged group, whereas lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malonaldehyde (MDA) content were decreased. PEF-treated KDHCH exhibited an increased capacity to maintain the stability of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reduced the level of caspase-3. These results indicate that PEF treatment can enhance the intracellular antioxidant activity of KDHCH, which can inhibit the effect of H2O2 oxidation on HepG2 cells by inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular ROS, regulating antioxidant related enzymes, and blocking the apoptotic mitochondrial pathways activated by ROS."

However, for the incorporation in to food, it is necessary to develop nanometric systems that are stable under the different conditions to which the food is submitted during its production, transport, and storage. Thus, with the intent to develop a stable nanoemulsion formulation for food application, the physical and chemical stability of β-carotene nanoemulsions after thermal treatments and storage under different conditions, were investigated in this work. The β-carotene nanoemulsions were formulated with corn oil, by applying high-pressure homogenization, with an average size in the 300 nm range, which is within the appropriate scale for industrial preparations, such as foods and cosmetics. The nanoemulsion droplets had negative charge (more than -25 mV) and monodisperse profile. The sample were pasteurized, sterilized, and stored at 4, 25, and 37 °C in the presence and absence of light for up to 90 days. Following the heat treatments and storage, the nanoemulsions showed no evidence of physical destabilization, retaining 70-80% of the carotenoid after the pasteurization and sterilization processes, and 70% when stored at 4 °C without light, respectively. Overall, our findings provide new information about the physical and chemical stability of β-carotene nanoemulsions during traditional thermal processes and environmental conditions.","Thermally-induced formation of taste-active 2,5-diketopiperazines from short-chain peptide precursors in cocoa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108743,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"2,5-diketopiperazines (DKPs) are cyclic dipeptides responsible for the specific bitter taste of cocoa formed during roasting. The 2,5-diketopiperazine and peptide composition of four different cocoa bean samples from different origins were studied using LC-MS techniques. 34 diketopiperazines were identified, of which 10 are newly reported in cocoa. Their formation was followed during two different roasting time-series using a zero-order and an alternative Prout-Tompkins solid-state kinetic models. The activation energies of diketopiperazine formation showed a distribution close to normal with individual values depending on the nature of the substituents. The relative concentrations of the DKPs were correlated with their putative peptide precursors in unroasted cocoa bean samples. The results showed a significant positive correlation, indicating that oligopeptides formed in cocoa bean fermentation are taste-precursors for bitter tasting diketopiperazines. Unexpectedly, for most diketopiperazines, a single major peptide precursor could be suggested.",Global Profile: Going beyond liking to better understand product experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108742,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Over the last few years, interest in collecting an increasing variety of information in order to acquire a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the consumer experience with products has steadily grown. The present study was designed to develop a methodological approach to explore the Global Profile of products within a category. A product-specific questionnaire was developed using one-on-one online interviews conducted with a modified version of the Repertory Grid Method (RGM) combined with semiotic analysis, EmoSemio, extended to cover all the main dimensions of product experience of the category of processed tomato. A 96 item questionnaire - including liking, sensory properties, emotions, emotional and functional conceptualisations and contextual appropriateness measures - was developed and employed in a home use test with 196 consumers who evaluated 9 products (one per day). All the statements were found to discriminate between products with the exception of one. A Multiple Factor Analysis showed that emotions were highly correlated with functional/emotional conceptualisations, while sensory properties were mainly related to emotional conceptualisations (memories) and uses in the recipes. The information provided by the simultaneous collection of these different dimensions allows to go beyond liking and may be used in product development and innovation in order to better understand the consumer experience of a product.",Establishment of new assessment method for the synergistic effect between umami peptides and monosodium glutamate using electronic tongue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108741,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"In order to investigate the synergistic effect between umami peptides and monosodium glutamate (MSG), a new assessment method was established using electronic tongue. After 36 kinds of umami peptides synthesized by peptide solid phase synthesis, their taste characteristics were preliminarily explored by electronic tongue technology, and then the umami intensity was ranked before and after addition of MSG, using a concentration of 0.35% of MSG as control. In addition, the sensory evaluation was utilized to verify the results of the electronic tongue. Finally, the umami intensity and the synergistic effect of umami peptides and MSG were also investigated by the aroma chicken model (ACM). Results showed that peptide Lys-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Asp-Glu-Glu (KE-8) and Arg-Leu (RL) have the strongest umami taste, Asp-Asp-Asp (DDD) and Glu-Ser-Val (ESV) have the strongest synergistic effect with MSG, which could increase the umami intensity. The ESV and Glu-Asp-Asp (EDD) showed the strongest synergistic effect with ACM. The evaluation method could provide the objective data for further investigating for the synergistic theory.","Eight antihypertensive peptides from the protein hydrolysate of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba): Isolation, identification, and activity evaluation on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108740,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"In this report, eight antihypertensive peptides were isolated from protein hydrolysate of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) using ultrafiltration and chromatography consecutively, and their sequences were identified as Trp-Phe, Tyr-Arg-Lys-Glu-Arg, Tyr-Arg-Lys, Val-Asp, Tyr-Lys-Asp, Phe-Gln-Lys, Phe-Ala-Ser, and Phe-Arg-Lys-Glu. The IC50 values of Trp-Phe (0.32 ± 0.05 mg/mL) and Phe-Ala-Ser (0.15 ± 0.02 mg/mL) on ACE inhibitory activity were significantly (p ≤ .05) lower than those of the other six peptides. Furthermore, Trp-Phe, Tyr-Arg-Lys, Phe-Gln-Lys, and Phe-Ala-Ser did not only increase the nitric oxide (NO) concentration and decreased the content of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner after 24 h, but also significantly reversed the decreased production of NO in the presence of 0.5 μM norepinephrine and the effect of NE on ET-1 production.

The role of enzymes in this process is not yet understood. An experiment with dried green rooibos plant material pre-treated at 170 °C for 30 min to denature and ""inactivate"" endogenous enzymes was conducted to confirm the role of oxidative enzymes. The phenolic composition of ""enzyme inactivated"" plant material was not significantly (p ≥ .05) affected by simulated fermentation, compared to control samples, as determined using piece-wise multivariate analysis of variance for successive time intervals. This proves that rooibos enzymes participate in the oxidation of phenolic compounds during fermentation of the plant material. A kinetic modeling approach was subsequently used to establish reaction kinetic parameters for selected rooibos phenolic compounds. The degradation of aspalathin and nothofagin and formation of eriodictyol glucosides during simulated fermentation at four temperatures from 37 to 50 °C were best described by the fractional conversion model based on first-order kinetics (r2 > 0.98), which allows for non-zero equilibrium concentrations. The extent of degradation for other compounds was too low to enable kinetic modeling. Reaction rates for the degradation/formation of phenolic compounds during fermentation followed the Arrhenius law. Less phenolic degradation (higher equilibrium concentration), but a higher reaction rate constant, was observed at higher temperatures, which could possibly be attributed to inactivation of enzymes.",Neuroprotective effects of different molecular weight peptide fractions obtained from beef by hydrolysis with commercial enzymes in SH-SY5Y cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108738,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"The neuroprotective effect of peptide fractions of different molecular weights obtained from beef by commercial enzymes in SH-SY5Y cells was investigated. The <3 kDa and < 10 kDa peptide fractions were obtained by hydrolysis using inexpensive commercial enzymes (alkaline-AK and papain). The resulting peptide fractions decreased the apoptotic ratio by 20.06% to 33.25% in hydrogen peroxide treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the peptide fractions obtained by alkaline-AK and papain did not affect cytotoxicity. In addition, the <3 kDa peptide fractions obtained using alkaline-AK reduced DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species generation, and increased superoxide dismutase activity and catalase levels in H2O2 treated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, the <3 kDa and < 10 kDa peptide fractions showed strong antioxidant activities in 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, iron chelation, and reducing power tests. The present results suggest that the <3 kDa peptide fractions obtained using alkaline-AK have superior neuroprotective activity and antioxidative activities.",Effect of grape must polyphenols on yeast metabolism during alcoholic fermentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108737,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"In red winemaking, polyphenols from grape berry pericarp and seed are extracted during fermentation and their interactions with yeast have been widely demonstrated. However, information concerning the impact of extracted polyphenols on yeast metabolism during fermentation is missing. The aim of this study was to further explore interactions between yeasts and polyphenols and to identify their effects on yeast metabolism and fermentation kinetics. This impact was studied in synthetic musts for four commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strains, using polyphenols purified from a thermovinification must, in both stressed (phytosterol deficient medium) and non-stressed conditions. Interactions between grape polyphenols and yeast cells were substantiated from the early stage of fermentation by means of epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. If these interactions were limited to yeast cell walls in non-stressed conditions, the passage of polyphenols through yeast envelope and their accumulation in the intracellular space of living cells was shown in phytosterol-deficient medium. Whatever the conditions used (stressed and non-stressed conditions) and for all strains, the presence of polyphenols led to a significant decrease of cell growth (50%), CO2 production rate (60 to 80%) and nitrogen consumption (3 to 4 times less), resulting in increased fermentation lengths. The perturbation of yeast growth and metabolism due to polyphenol compounds was likely mostly linked to their interactions with the yeast plasma membrane. From the mid-stationary phase to the end of the fermentation, an adaptive response was exhibited by yeast, resulting in lower mortality. This work evidenced a strong impact of polyphenols on yeast fermentative capacity and highlighted the importance of a better knowledge of the mechanisms involved to improve the management of fermentations in the context of red winemaking.",Activity profiling of Serbian and some other European Merlot wines in inflammation and oxidation processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108736,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Merlot are worldwide recognized red wines.

Among the examined phenolics, the most abundant acid in all samples was the gallic acid (14.3-58.3 mg/L), catechin (9.1-49.3 mg/L) was the dominant flavonoid, malvidin-3-O-glucoside (2.63-66.5 mg/L) leading anthocyanin, whereas resveratrol was found in a usual concentration (0.18-4.67 mg/L). Differences determined in phenolic profiles, mainly in content of quercetin, rutin and p-coumaric acid, leaded to separation of Serbian from foreing Merlot wines. Results of standard antioxidant assays (DPPH•, ABTS•+ and •NO scavenger capacity reducing power (FRAP), lipid peroxidation) revealed French Merlot as the most potent, but also pointed out some Serbian samples. The correlation between the content of dominant phenolics and antioxidant activity was sporadic, but samples with the highest overall phenolic content, generally had higher antioxidant potential. Concentration of wines and number of cells in ant-inflammatory assay were chosen to mimic in vivo conditions. So, the potency of examined wines to decrease the production of macrophage-derived PGE2 and TXA2 (up to 65.5 and 47.9%, respectively), could be considered as in vitro evidence of positve health effect. Regarding the phenolic content and anti-inflammatory contribution of the most abundant compounds, no correlation was witnessed. In general, this study showed interesting potential of Serbian Merlot wines, comparable to health-promoting effects of renewed Eurepean ones.",Impact of a selected Debaryomyces hansenii strain's inoculation on the quality of Sardinian fermented sausages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108735,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 05 21,"Dominant yeast species in Salsiccia Sarda, a traditional fermented sausage produced in Sardinia (Italy), were evaluated through the monitoring three typical production processes. Six different species were identified by molecular techniques, but Debaryomyces (D.) hansenii proved to be dominant. A D. hansenii strain was selected according to its technological features and used in three experimental sausage productions at farm scale with the aim to evaluate its antifungal effect. In all cases, two batches were inoculated with a previously selected autochthonous starter cultures (Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus), whereas two batches were left to spontaneous fermentation. D. hansenii was inoculated on the sausages surface by brushing after the sausages drying, by immersion in a yeast suspension after the stuffing, or, alternatively, casings were dipped in a yeast suspension before the dough stuffing. Microbial counts in the sausages core did not appear to be affected by D. hansenii application, while outcomes obtained for casings appeared soundly diversified. Brushing on the sausages surface at the onset of fermentation proved to be the best approach to treat sausages. Yeast inoculation exerted a noteworthy anti-mould effect, independently of the mode of application and, on the other hand, did not affect the overall quality and typical features of the product."

E,2019 05 21,"Using mesoscopic interfacial models and microscopic density functional theory we study fluid adsorption at a dry wall decorated with three completely wet stripes of width L separated by distances D_{1} and D_{2}. The stripes interact with the fluid with long-range forces inducing a large finite-size contribution to the surface free energy. We show that this nonextensive free-energy contribution scales with lnL and drives different types of bridging transition corresponding to the merging of liquid drops adsorbed at neighboring wetting stripes when the separation between them is molecularly small. We determine the surface phase diagram and show that this exhibits two triple points, where isolated drops, double drops, and triple drops coexist. For the symmetric case, D_{1}=D_{2}≡D, our results also confirm that the equilibrium droplet configuration always has the symmetry of the substrate corresponding to either three isolated drops when D is large or a single triple drop when D is small; however, symmetry-broken configurations do occur in a metastable part of the phase diagram which lies very close to the equilibrium-bridging phase boundary. Implications for phase transitions on other types of patterned surface are considered.",Reconstruction of dynamic networks with time-delayed interactions in the presence of fast-varying noises.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108723,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Most complex social, biological and technological systems can be described by dynamic networks. Reconstructing network structures from measurable data is a fundamental problem in almost all interdisciplinary fields. Network nodes interact with each other and those interactions often have diversely distributed time delays. Accurate reconstruction of any targeted interaction to a node requires measured data of all its neighboring nodes together with information on the time delays of interactions from these neighbors. When networks are large, these data are often not available and time-delay factors are deeply hidden. Here we show that fast-varying noise can be of great help in solving these challenging problems. By computing suitable correlations, we can infer the intensity and time delay of any targeted interaction with the data of two related nodes (driving and driven nodes) only while all other nodes in the network are hidden. This method is analytically derived and fully justified by extensive numerical simulations.",Autonomous thermal machine for amplification and control of energetic coherence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108722,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We present a model for an autonomous quantum thermal machine composed of two qubits capable of manipulating and even amplifying the local coherence in a nondegenerate external system. The machine uses only thermal resources, namely, contact with two heat baths at different temperatures, and the external system has a nonzero initial amount of coherence. The method we propose allows for an interconversion between energy, both work and heat, and coherence in an autonomous configuration working in out-of-equilibrium conditions. This model raises interesting questions about the role of fundamental limitations on transformations involving coherence and opens up new possibilities in the manipulation of coherence by autonomous thermal machines.",Uniform line fillings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108721,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Deterministic fabrication of random metamaterials requires filling of a space with randomly oriented and randomly positioned chords with an on-average homogenous density and orientation, which is a nontrivial task. We describe a method to generate fillings with such chords, lines that run from edge to edge of the space, in any dimension. We prove that the method leads to random but on-average homogeneous and rotationally invariant fillings of circles, balls, and arbitrary-dimensional hyperballs from which other shapes such as rectangles and cuboids can be cut. We briefly sketch the historic context of Bertrand's paradox and Jaynes's solution by the principle of maximum ignorance. We analyze the statistical properties of the produced fillings, mapping out the density profile and the line-length distribution and comparing them to analytic expressions. We study the characteristic dimensions of the space between the chords by determining the largest enclosed circles and balls in this pore space, finding a lognormal distribution of the pore sizes. We apply the algorithm to the direct-laser-writing fabrication design of optical multiple-scattering samples as three-dimensional cubes of random but homogeneously positioned and oriented chords.",Deciphering the transport of elastic filaments by antagonistic motor proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108720,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Intermediate filaments are long elastic fibers that are transported by the microtubule-associated motor proteins kinesin and dynein inside the cell. How elastic filaments are efficiently transported by antagonistic motors is not well understood and is difficult to measure with current experimental techniques. Adapting the tug-of-war paradigm for vesiclelike cargos, we develop a mathematical model to describe the motion of an elastic filament punctually bound to antagonistic motors. As observed in cells, up to three modes of transport are obtained; dynein-driven retrograde, kinesin-driven anterograde fast motions, and a slow motion. Motor properties and initial conditions that depend on intracellular context regulate the transport of filaments. Filament elasticity is found to affect both the mode and the efficiency of transport. We further show that the coordination of motors along the filament emerges from the interplay between intracellular context and elastic properties of filaments.",Resonance-assisted tunneling in four-dimensional normal-form Hamiltonians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108719,Physical review.

We demonstrate that the double resonance gives rise to a complicated tunneling peak structure. Such double resonances occur in Hamiltonian systems with an at least four-dimensional phase space. To explain the tunneling peak structure, we use the universal description of single and double resonances by the four-dimensional normal-form Hamiltonians. By applying perturbative methods, we reveal the underlying mechanism of enhancement and suppression of tunneling and obtain excellent quantitative agreement. Using a minimal matrix model, we obtain an intuitive understanding.",Effect of particles with repulsive interactions enclosed in both rigid spherical shells and flexible fluid vesicles studied by Monte Carlo simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108718,Physical review.

The distribution of the particles and the effective bending coefficient and surface tension of the membrane are analyzed. The shape and internal structure of the vesicle containing the particles are investigated as the vesicle volume is decreased. It is revealed that the repulsive interaction between particles produces a layered structure and stiffens the membrane. When particles repulsively interact over a long range, the membrane takes on a dumbbell form.",Melting of a two-dimensional monodisperse cluster crystal to a cluster liquid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108717,Physical review.

We present a simple mean-field characterization of the cluster-crystal ground state, corroborating with Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of densities. The efficiency of several Monte Carlo algorithms is compared, and the challenges of thermal equilibrium sampling are identified. We demonstrate that the liquid to cluster-crystal phase transition is of first order and occurs in a single step, and the liquid phase is a cluster liquid.",Extreme contractility and torsional compliance of soft ribbons under high twist.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108716,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We investigate experimentally and model the mechanical response of a soft Hookean ribbon submitted to large twist η and longitudinal tension T, under clamped boundary conditions. We derive a formula for the torque M using the Föppl-von Kàrmàn equations up to third order in twist, incorporating a twist-tension coupling. In the stable helicoid regime, quantitative agreement with experimental data is obtained. When twisted above a critical twist η_{L}(T), ribbons develop wrinkles and folds which modify qualitatively the mechanical behavior. We show a surprisingly large longitudinal contraction upon twist, reminiscent of a Poynting effect, and a much lower torsional stiffness. Far from threshold, we identify two regimes depending on the applied T. In a high-T regime, we find that the torque scales as ηT and the contraction as η^{2}, in agreement with a far from threshold analysis where compression and bending stresses are neglected. In a low-T regime, the contraction still scales as η^{2} but the torque appears T independent and linear with η. We argue that the large curvature of the folds now contributes significantly to the torque. This regime is discussed in the context of asymptotic isometry for very thin plates submitted to vanishing tension but large change of shape, as in crumpling.",Statistical mechanics of a single active slider on a fluctuating interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108715,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We study the statistical mechanics of a single active slider on a fluctuating interface, by means of numerical simulations and theoretical arguments. The slider, which moves by definition towards the interface minima, is active as it also stimulates growth of the interface. Even though such a particle has no counterpart in thermodynamic systems, active sliders may provide a simple model for ATP-dependent membrane proteins that activate cytoskeletal growth. We find a wide range of dynamical regimes according to the ratio between the timescales associated with the slider motion and the interface relaxation. If the interface dynamics is slow, the slider behaves like a random walker in a random environment, which, furthermore, is able to escape environmental troughs by making them grow. This results in different dynamic exponents to the interface and the particle: the former behaves as an Edward-Wilkinson surface with dynamic exponent 2, whereas the latter has dynamic exponent 3/2. When the interface is fast, we get sustained ballistic motion with the particle surfing a membrane wave created by itself. However, if the interface relaxes immediately (i.e., it is infinitely fast), particle motion becomes symmetric and goes back to diffusive. Due to such a rich phenomenology, we propose the active slider as a toy model of fundamental interest in the field of active membranes and, generally, whenever the system constituent can alter the environment by spending energy."

This model constitutes a stationary, ""grid free"" extension of W cascades introduced in the past by Arneodo, Bacry, and Muzy using a wavelet orthogonal basis. Moreover, our approach generically provides multifractal random functions that are not invariant by time reversal and therefore is able to account for skewed multifractal models and for the so-called ""leverage effect."" In that respect, it can be well suited to providing synthetic turbulence models or to reproducing the main observed features of asset price fluctuations in financial markets.",Conformation of a semiflexible filament in a quenched random potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108703,Physical review.

The transmission is assessed in terms of transferred angular momentum and transferred mechanical work. We highlight the quantum features of the model such as quantum state revivals in the interlocked rotation and interference-enhanced transmission, which could be observed in prospective rotational optomechanics experiments.","Dynamic phases, stratification, laning, and pattern formation for driven bidisperse disk systems in the presence of quenched disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108701,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Using numerical simulations, we examine the dynamics of driven two-dimensional bidisperse disks flowing over quenched disorder. The system exhibits a series of distinct dynamical phases as a function of applied driving force and packing fraction, including a phase-separated state as well as a smectic state with liquid-like or polycrystalline features. At low driving forces, we find a clogged phase with an isotropic density distribution, while at intermediate driving forces the disks separate into bands of high and low densities with either liquid-like or polycrystalline structure in the high-density bands. In addition to the density phase separation, we find that in some cases there is a fractionation of the disk species, particularly when the disk size ratio is large. The species phase-separated regimes form a variety of patterns such as large disks separated by chains of smaller disks. Our results show that the formation of laning states can be enhanced by tuning the ratio of disk radius of the two species, due to the clumping of small disks in the interstitial regions between the large disks. This system could be experimentally realized using sterically interacting colloidal particles suspended in a viscous fluid driven over random pinning arrays or granular matter suspended in fluid moving over a random landscape.",Analytic theory of relativistic self-focusing for a Gaussian light beam entering a plasma: Renormalization-group approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108700,Physical review.

We study three stationary self-focused waveguide propagation modes with respect to controlling laser-plasma parameters for a Gaussian radial intensity distribution at the plasma boundary. The proposed theory specifies the domains and their boundaries on the plane of the controlling parameters where (1) self-trapping, (2) self-focusing on the axis, and (3) tubular self-focusing solutions occur.

E,2019 05 21,"Thanks to the development of machine learning techniques, it has been shown that the supervised learning can be useful to study critical phenomena of various systems. However, the supervised learning cannot be done without labels which require knowledge about critical behavior of the system. To overcome this barrier, unsupervised machine learning methods have been considered and the confusion scheme has been proposed. In this study, we use the confusion scheme of the unsupervised learning and investigate critical behavior of various systems which exhibit single (double) phase transitions with (without) quasi-long-range order. In detail, we choose the two-color Ashkin-Teller model, the XY model, and the eight-state clock model as such systems and snapshots of the spin configurations at various temperatures are collected via Monte Carlo simulations to be used as input data for the unsupervised machine learning. We also put focus on the size dependence of results and validate the availability of the confusion scheme in thermodynamic limit. Our results indicate that the confusion scheme of the unsupervised learning successfully locates the approximate transition points for all models and becomes more accurate as the system size is increased. We also find a characteristic feature of the result which reflects the presence of a quasi-long-range order. We conclude that regardless of the presence of a quasi-long-range order, single and double phase transitions can be detected via the confusion scheme.",Three-state model with competing antiferromagnetic and pairing interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108696,Physical review.

The Hamiltonian has a term which favors antiferromagnetism and an additional competing interaction which favors bonding between pairs of antiparallel spins mediated by holes. For low concentration of holes the dominant interaction between particles has antiferromagnetic character, leading to an antiferromagnetic phase in the temperature-hole concentration phase diagram, qualitatively similar to the antiferromagnetic phase of doped Mott insulators. For growing concentration of holes antiferromagnetic order is weakened and a phase with a different kind of order mediated by holes appears. This last phase has the form of a dome in the T-hole concentration plane. The whole phase diagram resembles those of some families of high-T_{c} superconductors.

The resultant force on the filament drives it out of equilibrium. The distance from equilibrium is reflected in the end-to-end distribution, modified bending stiffness, and a transition to spiral morphology of the polymer.

E,2019 05 21,"Algorithms for community detection are usually stochastic, leading to different partitions for different choices of random seeds. Consensus clustering has proven to be an effective technique to derive more stable and accurate partitions than the ones obtained by the direct application of the algorithm. However, the procedure requires the calculation of the consensus matrix, which can be quite dense if (some of) the clusters of the input partitions are large. Consequently, the complexity can get dangerously close to quadratic, which makes the technique inapplicable on large graphs. Here, we present a fast variant of consensus clustering, which calculates the consensus matrix only on the links of the original graph and on a comparable number of additional node pairs, suitably chosen. This brings the complexity down to linear, while the performance remains comparable as the full technique. Therefore, our fast consensus clustering procedure can be applied on networks with millions of nodes and links.",Data-driven inference of hidden nodes in networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108681,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"The explosion of activity in finding interactions in complex systems is driven by availability of copious observations of complex natural systems. However, such systems, e.g., the human brain, are rarely completely observable. Interaction network inference must then contend with hidden variables affecting the behavior of the observed parts of the system. We present an effective approach for model inference with hidden variables. From configurations of observed variables, we identify the observed-to-observed, hidden-to-observed, observed-to-hidden, and hidden-to-hidden interactions, the configurations of hidden variables, and the number of hidden variables. We demonstrate the performance of our method by simulating a kinetic Ising model, and show that our method outperforms existing methods. Turning to real data, we infer the hidden nodes in a neuronal network in the salamander retina and a stock market network. We show that predictive modeling with hidden variables is significantly more accurate than that without hidden variables. Finally, an important hidden variable problem is to find the number of clusters in a dataset. We apply our method to classify MNIST handwritten digits. We find that there are about 60 clusters which are roughly equally distributed among the digits.",Effects of competition between random sequential nucleation of point-sized seeds and island growth by adsorption of finite-sized grains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108680,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We study random sequential adsorption of particles from a pool onto a one-dimensional substrate following ballistic deposition rules with separate nucleation and growth processes occurring simultaneously. Nucleation describes the formation of point-sized seeds, and after a seed is sown, it acts as an attractor and grows in size by the addition of grains of a fixed size. At each time step either an already-nucleated seed can increase in size, or a new seed may be nucleated. We incorporate a parameter m to describe the relative rates of growth to nucleation. We solve the model analytically to obtain a gap size distribution function and a general expression for the jamming coverage as a function of m. We show that the jamming coverage θ(m) reaches its maximum value of θ(m)=1 in the limit m→∞ following a power-law θ(∞)-θ(m)∼Km^{-1/2} for some constant K. We also perform an extensive Monte Carlo simulation and find good agreement between analytic and numerical results.",Doubly nonlinear waveguides with self-switching functionality selection capabilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108679,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"In this article, we investigate the effects of the interplay between quadratic and cubic nonlinearities on the propagation of elastic waves in periodic waveguides. Through this framework, we unveil an array of wave control strategies that are intrinsically available in the response of doubly nonlinear systems and we infer some basic design principles for tunable elastic metamaterials. The objective is to simultaneously account for two sources of nonlinearity that are responsible for distinct and complementary phenomena and whose effects are therefore typically discussed separately in the literature. Our study explicitly targets the intertwined effects that the two types of nonlinearity exert on each other, which modify the way in which their respective signatures are observed in the dynamic response. Through two illustrative examples we show how the dispersion correction caused by cubic nonlinearity can be used as an internal switch, or mode selector, capable of tuning on or off certain high-frequency response features that are generated through quadratic mechanisms. To this end, a multiple scale analysis is employed to obtain a full analytical solution for the nonlinear response that includes a complete description of the dual frequency-wave number dispersion correction shifts induced on all the branches, and elucidates the conditions necessary for the establishment of phase matching conditions.",Models of infiltration into homogeneous and fractal porous media with localized sources.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108678,Physical review.

In this model, particles released at a source, maintained at a constant density value, execute unbiased random walks over a lattice; a model that represents solute infiltration by diffusion into a medium in contact with a reservoir of fixed concentration. A scaling approach shows that the infiltrated length, area, or volume evolves in time as the number of distinct sites visited by a single random walker in the same medium. This is consistent with numerical simulations of the lattice model and exact and numerical solutions of the corresponding diffusion equation. In a Sierpinski carpet, the infiltrated area is expected to evolve as t^{D_{F}/D_{W}} (Alexander-Orbach relation), where D_{F} is the fractal dimension of the medium and D_{W} is the random-walk dimension; the numerical integration of the diffusion equation supports this result with very good accuracy and improves results of lattice random-walk simulations. In a Menger sponge in which D_{F}>D_{W} (i.e., a fractal with a dimension close to 3), a linear time increase of the infiltrated volume is theoretically predicted and confirmed numerically. Thus, no evidence of fractality can be observed in measurements of infiltrated volumes or masses in media where random walks are not recurrent, although the tracer diffusion is anomalous. We compare our findings with results for a fluid infiltration model in which the pressure head is constant at the source and the front displacement is driven by the local gradient of that head. Exact solutions in two and three dimensions and numerical results in a carpet show that this type of fluid infiltration is in the same universality class of RWI, with an equivalence between the head and the particle concentration. These results set a relation between different infiltration processes with localized sources and the recurrence properties of random walks in the same media.",Directed momentum current induced by the PT-symmetric driving.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108677,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We investigate the directed momentum current in the quantum kicked rotor model with PT-symmetric deriving potential. For the quantum nonresonance case, the values of quasienergy become complex when the strength of the imaginary part of the kicking potential exceeds a threshold value, which demonstrates the appearance of the spontaneous PT symmetry breaking. In the vicinity of the transition point, the momentum current exhibits a staircase growth with time. Each platform of the momentum current corresponds to the mean momentum of some eigenstates of the Floquet operator whose imaginary parts of the quasienergy are significantly large. Above the transition point, the momentum current increases linearly with time. Interestingly, its acceleration rate exhibits a kind of ""quantized"" increment with the kicking strength. We propose a modified classical acceleration mode of the kicked rotor model to explain such an intriguing phenomenon. Our theoretical prediction is in good agreement with numerical results.",Typology of phase transitions in Bayesian inference problems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108676,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Many inference problems undergo phase transitions as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, a prominent example of this phenomenon being found in the stochastic block model (SBM) that generates a random graph with a hidden community structure. Some of these phase transitions affect the information-theoretic optimal (but possibly computationally expensive) estimation procedure, others concern the behavior of efficient iterative algorithms. A computational gap opens when the phase transitions for these two aspects do not coincide, leading to a hard phase in which optimal inference is computationally challenging. In this paper we refine this description in two ways. From a qualitative perspective, we emphasize the existence of more generic phase diagrams with a hybrid-hard phase, in which it is computationally easy to reach a nontrivial inference accuracy but computationally hard to match the information-theoretic optimal one. We support this discussion by quantitative expansions of the functional cavity equations that describe inference problems on sparse graphs, around their trivial solution. These expansions shed light on the existence of hybrid-hard phases, for a large class of planted constraint satisfaction problems, and on the question of the tightness of the Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound for the associated tree reconstruction problem. Our results show that the instability of the trivial fixed point is not generic evidence for the Bayes optimality of the message-passing algorithms. We clarify in particular the status of the symmetric SBM with four communities and of the tree reconstruction of the associated Potts model: In the assortative (ferromagnetic) case the KS bound is always tight, whereas in the disassortative (antiferromagnetic) case we exhibit an explicit criterion involving the degree distribution that separates a large-degree regime where the KS bound is tight and a low-degree regime where it is not. We also investigate the SBM with two communities of different sizes, also known as the asymmetric Ising model, and describe quantitatively its computational gap as a function of its asymmetry, as well as a version of the SBM with two groups of q_{1} and q_{2} communities. We complement this study with numerical simulations of the belief propagation iterative algorithm, confirming that its behavior on large samples is well described by the cavity method.",Critical transitions in heterogeneous networks: Loss of low-degree nodes as an early warning signal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108675,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"A large number of real networks show abrupt phase transition phenomena in response to environmental changes. In this case, cascading phenomena can induce drastic and discontinuous changes in the system state and lead to collapse. Although complex network theory has been used to investigate these drastic events, we are still unable to predict them effectively. We here analyze collapse phenomena by proposing a minimal two-state dynamic on a complex network and introducing the effect of local connectivities on the evolution of network nodes. We find that a heterogeneous system of interconnected components presents a mixed response to stress and can serve as a control indicator. In particular, before the critical transition point is reached a severe loss of low-degree nodes is observed, masked by the minimal failure of higher-degree nodes. Accordingly, we suggest that a significant reduction in less connected nodes can indicate impending global failure.",Non-Markovian edge-based compartmental modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108674,Physical review.

It is confirmed that non-Markovian systems of equations obtained in this manner, which describe the spread of epidemic diseases, can be represented as Markovian systems of equations. The application of the proposed method in particular types of edge-based compartmental models is considered. In particular, the analytical expressions for the basic reproductive number and the final size of an epidemic are derived for the non-Markovian dynamic variable-degree model."

Depending on the cluster state, the evolution of the target qubit may correspond to its effective interaction with a thermal bath, a coherent (laser) drive, or a squeezed bath. In cases where the target qubit relaxes to a thermal state, its dynamics can exhibit a quantum advantage, whereby the target-qubit temperature can be scaled up proportionally to N^{2} and the thermalization time can be shortened by a similar factor, provided the appropriate coherence in the cluster is prepared by nonthermal means. We dub these effects quantum superthermalization because of the analogies to superradiance.

E,2019 05 21,"A qualitative mechanism for autowave pattern formation at the reaction front, observed in certain chemical systems including combustion, is suggested. It is assumed that patterns are formed as a result of interaction of two subsystems, one of which is responsible for the reaction front propagation while the other determines the formation of waves at the front. A corresponding phenomenological model is constructed in which reaction front propagation is described by a submodel of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov type and waves on the front are described by a submodel of the FitzHugh-Nagumo type. In the three-dimensional numerical analysis, it is demonstrated that the model is able to qualitatively explain the emergence of wave patterns of both spiral and target types, which are experimentally observed at the reaction front. The dependence of these patterns on the velocity and thickness of the front is examined.",Numerical investigation on the collapse of a bubble cluster near a solid wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108661,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"This paper studies numerically the collapse of a cluster of cavitation bubbles (as a primitive model for a bubble cloud) near a solid wall. The homogeneous two-phase mixture model is used, with the liquid-vapor interface resolved by volume of fluid method. The liquid is treated as compressible, allowing the propagation of pressure waves at the speeds determined by a state equation. This cluster consists of 27 identical bubbles, evenly distributed in a cubic region, with various bubble-wall and bubble-bubble distances considered. Our simulations suggest that the bubble-wall distance plays a more significant role. The maximum impulsive pressure of 41MPa is achieved when the cluster is very close to the wall. The inward progress of collapse is observed by examining the evolutions of bubble shapes and flow fields, with two distinctly different sequences of collapse identified between the small and large bubble-wall distances. At a large bubble distance, the centermost bubble is the last to collapse, while at a small bubble distance, it is the central bubble nearest to the wall which collapses lastly. This difference can also explain the more intensive impulsive pressure for the smaller bubble-wall distances. The proposed numerical approach is of special interest because it can resolve the details of bubble-bubble and bubble-wall interactions, which are significant to the study of the collapse of a cavitation cloud, and its potential damage to hydraulic systems.",Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and out of time order correlators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108660,Physical review.

Another signal of chaos is a positive Lyapunov exponent, defined on the basis of Loschmidt echo or out of time order correlators. For this exponent to be positive, correlations between matrix elements unrelated by symmetry, usually neglected, have to exist.

We show analytically that, depending on the sign of the magnetic field, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation does not hold for the currents associated with work and heat. A strong magnetic field can effectively localize the particle with concomitant bounded fluctuations and low dissipation.

Analysis of a standard epidemic-type aftershock sequences (ETAS) earthquake model indicates that the empirically observed earthquake memory can be reproduced only for a narrow range of the model's parameters. This finding therefore provides tight constraints on the model's parameters and can serve as a testbed for existing earthquake forecasting models. Furthermore, we show that by implementing DFA and CP results, the ETAS model can significantly improve the short-term forecasting rate for the real (Italian) earthquake catalog.",Surface reaction-diffusion kinetics on lattice at the microscopic scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108654,Physical review.

Simulation schemes based on the microscopic lattice method (MLM) can model these processes at the microscopic scale by tracking individual molecules, represented as hard spheres, on fine lattice voxels. Although MLM is simple to implement and is generally less computationally demanding than off-lattice approaches, its accuracy and consistency in modeling surface reactions have not been fully verified. Using the Spatiocyte scheme, we study the accuracy of MLM in diffusion-influenced surface reactions. We derive the lattice-based bimolecular association rates for two-dimensional (2D) surface-surface reaction and one-dimensional (1D) volume-surface adsorption according to the Smoluchowski-Collins-Kimball model and random walk theory. We match the time-dependent rates on lattice with off-lattice counterparts to obtain the correct expressions for MLM parameters in terms of physical constants. The expressions indicate that the voxel size needs to be at least 0.6% larger than the molecule to accurately simulate surface reactions on triangular lattice. On square lattice, the minimum voxel size should be even larger, at 5%. We also demonstrate the ability of MLM-based schemes such as Spatiocyte to simulate a reaction-diffusion model that involves all dimensions: three-dimensional (3D) diffusion in the cytoplasm, 2D diffusion on the cell membrane, and 1D cytoplasm-membrane adsorption. With the model, we examine the contribution of the 2D reaction pathway to the overall reaction rate at different reactant diffusivity, reactivity, and concentrations."

The PBRM model describes one-dimensional samples with random long-range bonds. The bond strengths of the model, which decay as a power-law, are tuned by the parameter μ as A_{mn}∝|m-n|^{-μ}; while the sparsity is driven by the average network connectivity α: for α=0 the vertices in the network are isolated and for α=1 the network is fully connected and the PBRM model is recovered. Though it is known that the PBRM model has multifractal eigenfunctions at the critical value μ=μ_{c}=1, we clearly show [from the scaling of the relative fluctuation of the participation number I_{2} as well as the scaling of the probability distribution functions P(lnI_{2})] the existence of the critical value μ_{c}≡μ_{c}(α) for α<1.

E,2019 05 21,"The time-dependent solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with bistable potentials is considered in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the linear Fokker-Planck operator. The Fokker-Planck equation is the high friction limit of the corresponding Kramers' equation. Two different potentials are considered defined with a constant diffusion coefficient, ε, and position-dependent drift coefficients. The smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck operator, λ_{1}, provides the long-time rate coefficient for the transformation of the different species in the two stable states. A novel pseudospectral method with nonclassical polynomials is applied to this class of systems. The convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Fokker-Planck operator versus the number of basis functions is studied and compared with previous results. The results are consistent with Kramers' theory, and a linear relationship between lnλ_{1} and 1/ε for sufficiently small ε values is verified.

One of the main results of the paper is to show that the local anisotropy introduced by the dominant dipolar coupling in the relaxation rates of active surface elements induces a measurable dependence on sample orientation in the overall relaxation rates of the saturating fluid provided its confining structure is not statistically isotropic. Measurements of T_{1} proton relaxation on water saturating microcapillary tubes are performed to reveal the effect.",Large fluctuations of a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interface on a half line: The height statistics at a shifted point.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108640,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We consider a stochastic interface h(x,t), described by the 1+1 Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation on the half line x≥0 with the reflecting boundary at x=0. The interface is initially flat, h(x,t=0)=0. We focus on the short-time probability distribution P(H,L,t) of the height H of the interface at point x=L. Using the optimal fluctuation method, we determine the (Gaussian) body of the distribution and the strongly asymmetric non-Gaussian tails. We find that the slower-decaying tail scales as -sqrt[t]lnP≃|H|^{3/2}f_{-}(L/sqrt[|H|t]) and calculate the function f_{-} analytically. Remarkably, this tail exhibits a first-order dynamical phase transition at a critical value of L, L_{c}=0.60223⋯sqrt[|H|t]. The transition results from a competition between two different fluctuation paths of the system. The faster-decaying tail scales as -sqrt[t]lnP≃|H|^{5/2}f_{+}(L/sqrt[|H|t]). We evaluate the function f_{+} using a specially developed numerical method which involves solving a nonlinear second-order elliptic equation in Lagrangian coordinates. The faster-decaying tail also involves a sharp transition which occurs at a critical value L_{c}≃2sqrt[2|H|t]/π. This transition is similar to the one recently found for the KPZ equation on a ring, and we believe that it has the same fractional order, 5/2. It is smoothed, however, by small diffusion effects.","Bacterial range expansions on a growing front: Roughness, fixation, and directed percolation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108639,Physical review.

It has been extensively studied by analytical and numerical techniques in diverse contexts. Recently, DP has appeared as a generic model for the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of competing bacterial populations. Range expansion-the stochastic reproduction of bacteria competing for space to be occupied by their progeny-leads to a fluctuating and rough growth front, which is known from experiment and simulation to affect the underlying critical behavior of the DP transition. In this work, we employ symmetry arguments to construct a pair of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations describing the coevolution of surface roughness with the composition field of DP. Macroscopic manifestations (phenomenology) of these equations on growth patterns and genealogical tracks of range expansion are discussed; followed by a renormalization group analysis of possible scaling behaviors at the DP transition.",Jamming and percolation for deposition of k^{2}-mers on square lattices: A Monte Carlo simulation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108638,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Percolation and jamming of k×k square tiles (k^{2}-mers) deposited on square lattices have been studied by numerical simulations complemented with finite-size scaling theory and exact enumeration of configurations for small systems. The k^{2}-mers were irreversibly deposited into square lattices of sizes L×L with L/k ranging between 128 and 448 (64 and 224) for jamming (percolation) calculations. Jamming coverage θ_{j,k} was determined for a wide range of k values (2≤k≤100 with many intermediate k values to allow a fine scaling analysis). θ_{j,k} exhibits a decreasing behavior with increasing k, being θ_{j,k=∞}=0.5623(3) the limit value for large k^{2}-mer sizes. In addition, a finite-size scaling analysis of the jamming transition was carried out, and the corresponding spatial correlation length critical exponent ν_{j} was measured, being ν_{j}≈1. On the other hand, the obtained results for the percolation threshold θ_{c,k} showed that θ_{c,k} is an increasing function of k in the range 1≤k≤3. For k≥4, all jammed configurations are nonpercolating states and, consequently, the percolation phase transition disappears. An explanation for this phenomenon is offered in terms of the rapid increase with k of the number of surrounding occupied sites needed to reach percolation, which gets larger than the sufficient number of occupied sites to define jamming. In the case of k=2 and 3, the percolation thresholds are θ_{c,k=2}(∞)=0.60355(8) and θ_{c,k=3}=0.63110(9). Our results significantly improve the previously reported values of θ_{c,k=2}^{Naka}=0.601(7) and θ_{c,k=3}^{Naka}=0.621(6) [Nakamura, Phys. Rev. A 36, 2384 (1987)0556-279110.1103/PhysRevA.36.2384].

E,2019 05 21,"We consider the formalism of information decomposition of target effects from multisource interactions, i.e., the problem of defining redundant and synergistic components of the information that a set of source variables provides about a target, and apply it to the two-dimensional Ising model as a paradigm of a critically transitioning system. Intuitively, synergy is the information about the target variable that is uniquely obtained by taking the sources together, but not considering them alone; redundancy is the information which is shared by the sources. To disentangle the components of the information both at the static level and at the dynamical one, the decomposition is applied respectively to the mutual information and to the transfer entropy between a given spin, target, and a pair of neighboring spins (taken as the drivers). We show that a key signature of an impending phase transition (approached from the disordered size) is the fact that the synergy peaks in the disordered phase, both in the static and in the dynamic case: The synergy can thus be considered a precursor of the transition. The redundancy, instead, reaches its maximum at the critical temperature. The peak of the synergy of the transfer entropy is far more pronounced than those of the static mutual information. We show that these results are robust with respect to the details of the information decomposition approach, as we find the same results using two different methods; moreover, with respect to previous literature rooted in the notion of global transfer entropy, our results demonstrate that considering as few as three variables is sufficient to construct a precursor of the transition, and provide a paradigm for the investigation of a variety of systems prone to crisis, such as financial markets, social media, or epileptic seizures.",Finite-size effects on pattern selection in immiscible fluids subjected to horizontal vibrations in weightlessness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108636,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"A detailed numerical investigation of frozen wave pattern selection in finite rectangular containers under microgravity conditions is presented. The column growth cycle controlling mode transitions is described and the instability diagram showing selected wave number as function of the vibrational velocity is obtained. In contrast to the continuous monotonic dependence of pattern wave number on forcing predicted by linear inviscid theory in the limit of infinitely long containers, the pattern selection process in finite domains is characterized by solution branches that persist over discrete forcing intervals. We describe how properties of the selected frozen wave pattern, including the finite critical forcing value, depend on container length. In long containers, a transition from nearly symmetric to asymmetric columnar development is found at sufficiently high forcing values, with the loss of (approximate) reflection symmetry evident in the mean flow associated with the transient growth of the pattern. The effect of container height is considered separately, in the limit of both shallow and deep layers. Shallow layers suppress the development of long-wave perturbations leading to higher wave-number patterns whose growth may be associated with an asymmetric series of collisions between developing columns and container boundaries. In thick layers, lower pattern wave numbers are observed and, although the column growth is on average more regular, the final state is often asymmetric. Finally, we compare our results with the dependence on container aspect ratio Γ=L/2H predicted by inviscid theory. For Γ≳2, finite-size effects are reasonably weak and the numerically obtained thresholds are similar to but slightly higher than the theoretical values, most likely due to viscous effects. For Γ≲2, finite-size effects come to the fore and onset is significantly delayed.",Many-body perturbation theory and fluctuation relations for interacting population dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108635,Physical review.

However, it is quite difficult to insist on a general statement on living organisms since mathematical models heavily depend on phenomena that we focus on. Recently, it was reported that the fluctuation relations on the fitness of living organisms held for a quite general problem setting. But, interactions between organisms were not incorporated in the problem setting, though interaction plays critical roles in collective phenomena in physics and population dynamics. In this paper, we propose interacting models for population dynamics and provide the perturbative theory of population dynamics. Then, we derive the variational principle and fluctuation relations for interacting population dynamics.",Stabilization of steady states in an array of all-to-all coupled oscillators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108634,Physical review.

E,2019 05 21,"Coordination of dynamical routes can alleviate traffic congestion and is essential for the coming era of autonomous self-driving cars. However, dynamical route coordination is difficult and many existing routing protocols are either static or without intervehicle coordination. In this paper, we first apply the cavity approach in statistical physics to derive the theoretical behavior and an optimization algorithm for dynamical route coordination, but they become computationally intractable as the number of time segments increases. We therefore map static spatial networks to space-time networks to derive a computational feasible message-passing algorithm compatible with arbitrary system parameters; it agrees well with the analytical and algorithmic results of the conventional cavity approach and outperforms multistart greedy search in saving total travel time by as much as 15% in simulations. The study sheds light on the design of dynamical route coordination protocols and the solution to other dynamical problems via static analytical approaches on space-time networks.",Geometric properties of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the Ising model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108621,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We present a Monte Carlo study of the geometric properties of Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters of the Ising model on square [two-dimensional (2D)] and simple-cubic [three-dimensional (3D)] lattices. The wrapping probability, a dimensionless quantity characterizing the topology of the FK clusters on a torus, is found to suffer from smaller finite-size corrections than the well-known Binder ratio and yields a high-precision critical coupling as K_{c}(3D)=0.221654631(8). We then study other geometric properties of FK clusters at criticality. It is demonstrated that the distribution of the critical largest-cluster size C_{1} follows a single-variable function as P(C_{1},L)dC_{1}=P[over ̃](x)dx with x≡C_{1}/L^{d_{F}} (L is the linear size), where the fractal dimension d_{F} is identical to the magnetic exponent. An interesting bimodal feature is observed in distribution P[over ̃](x) in three dimensions, and attributed to the different approaching behaviors for K→K_{c}+0^{±}. To characterize the compactness of the FK clusters, we measure their graph distances and determine the shortest-path exponents as d_{min}(3D)=1.25936(12) and d_{min}(2D)=1.0940(2). Further, by excluding all the bridges from the occupied bonds, we obtain bridge-free configurations and determine the backbone exponents as d_{B}(3D)=2.1673(15) and d_{B}(2D)=1.7321(4). The estimates of the universal wrapping probabilities for the 3D Ising model and of the geometric critical exponents d_{min} and d_{B} either improve over the existing results or have not been reported yet. We believe that these numerical results would provide a testing ground in the development of further theoretical treatments of the 3D Ising model.",Glassy dynamics in asymmetric binary mixtures of hard spheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108620,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We perform a systematic and detailed study of the glass transition in highly asymmetric binary mixtures of colloidal hard spheres, combining differential dynamic microscopy experiments, event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical calculations, exploring the whole state diagram and determining the self-dynamics and collective dynamics of both species. Two distinct glassy states involving different dynamical arrest transitions are consistently described, namely, a double glass with the simultaneous arrest of the self-dynamics and collective dynamics of both species, and a single glass of large particles in which the self-dynamics of the small species remains ergodic. In the single-glass scenario, spatial modulations in the collective dynamics of both species occur due to the structure of the large spheres, a feature not observed in the double-glass domain. The theoretical results, obtained within the self-consistent generalized Langevin equation formalism, are in agreement with both simulations and experimental data, thus providing a stringent validation of this theoretical framework in the description of dynamical arrest in highly asymmetric mixtures. Our findings are summarized in a state diagram that classifies the various amorphous states of highly asymmetric mixtures by their dynamical arrest mechanisms.",Polarized angular-dependent reflectivity and density-dependent profiles of shock-compressed xenon plasmas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108619,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"New data for the reflectivity of shock-compressed xenon plasmas at pressures of 10-12 GPa at large incident angles are presented. In addition, measurements have been performed at different densities. These data allow to analyze the free-electron density profile across the shock wave front. Assuming a Fermi-like density profile, the width of the front layer is inferred. The reflectivity coefficients for the s- and p-polarized waves are calculated. The influence of atoms, which was taken into account on the level of the collision frequency, proves to be essential for the understanding of the reflection process. Subsequently, a unique density profile is sufficient to obtain good agreement with the experimental data at different incident angles and at all investigated optical laser frequencies. Reflectivity measurements for different densities allow to determine the dependence of shock-front density profiles on the plasma parameters. As a result, it was found that the width of the front layer increases with decreasing density.",Volterra-series approach to stochastic nonlinear dynamics: The Duffing oscillator driven by white noise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108618,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"The Duffing oscillator is a paradigm of bistable oscillatory motion in physics, engineering, and biology. Time series of such oscillations are often observed experimentally in a nonlinear system excited by a spontaneously fluctuating force. One is then interested in estimating effective parameter values of the stochastic Duffing model from these observations-a task that has not yielded to simple means of analysis. To this end we derive theoretical formulas for the statistics of the Duffing oscillator's time series. Expanding on our analytical results, we introduce methods of statistical inference for the parameter values of the stochastic Duffing model. By applying our method to time series from stochastic simulations, we accurately reconstruct the underlying Duffing oscillator. This approach is quite straightforward-similar techniques are used with linear Langevin models-and can be applied to time series of bistable oscillations that are frequently observed in experiments.",Role of coherence in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108617,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Exploiting the relative entropy of coherence, we isolate the coherent contribution in the energetics of a driven nonequilibrium quantum system. We prove that a division of the irreversible work can be made into a coherent and incoherent part. This provides an operational criterion for quantifying the coherent contribution in a generic nonequilibrium transformation on a closed quantum system. We then study such a contribution in two physical models of a driven qubit and kicked rotor. In addition, we also show that coherence generation is connected to the nonadiabaticity of a processes, for which it gives the dominant contribution for slow-enough transformations. The amount of generated coherence in the energy eigenbasis is equivalent to the change in diagonal entropy, and here we show that it fulfills a fluctuation theorem.",Random-matrix behavior of quantum nonintegrable many-body systems with Dyson's three symmetries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108616,Physical review.

We show that the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution in each of these classes agrees with that of random matrices having the same symmetry. By investigating the ratios between the standard deviations of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements, we numerically find that they are universal, depending only on symmetries of the Hamiltonian and an observable, as predicted by random matrix theory. These universal ratios are evaluated from long-time dynamics of small isolated quantum systems.",Gaussian statistics as an emergent symmetry of the stochastic scalar Burgers equation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108615,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Symmetries play a conspicuous role in the large-scale behavior of critical systems. In equilibrium they allow us to classify asymptotics into different universality classes, and out of equilibrium, they sometimes emerge as collective properties which are not explicit in the ""bare"" interactions. Here we elucidate the emergence of an up-down symmetry in the asymptotic behavior of the stochastic scalar Burgers equation in one and two dimensions, manifested by the occurrence of Gaussian fluctuations even within the time regime controlled by nonlinearities. This robustness of Gaussian behavior contradicts naive expectations due to the detailed relation-including the lack of up-down symmetry-between the Burgers equation and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, which paradigmatically displays non-Gaussian fluctuations described by Tracy-Widom distributions. We reach our conclusions via a dynamic renormalization group study of the field statistics, confirmed by direct evaluation of the field probability distribution function from numerical simulations of the dynamical equation.",Fragility and anomalous susceptibility of weakly interacting networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108614,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Percolation is a fundamental concept that has brought new understanding of the robustness properties of complex systems. Here we consider percolation on weakly interacting networks, that is, network layers coupled together by much fewer interlinks than the connections within each layer. For these kinds of structures, both continuous and abrupt phase transitions are observed in the size of the giant component. The continuous (second-order) transition corresponds to the formation of a giant cluster inside one layer and has a well-defined percolation threshold. The abrupt transition instead corresponds to the merger of coexisting giant clusters among different layers and is characterized by a remarkable uncertainty in the percolation threshold, which in turns causes an anomalous behavior of the observed susceptibility. We develop a simple mathematical model able to describe this phenomenon, using a susceptibility measure that defines the range where the abrupt transition is more likely to occur. Finite-size scaling analysis in the abrupt region supports the hypothesis of a genuine first-order phase transition.","Particle-shape-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108613,Physical review.

E,2019 05 21,"This Rapid Communication identifies the physical mechanism for the quench of turbulent resistivity in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics. Without an imposed, ordered magnetic field, a multiscale, blob-and-barrier structure of magnetic potential forms spontaneously. Magnetic energy is concentrated in thin, linear barriers, located at the interstices between blobs. The barriers quench the transport and kinematic decay of magnetic energy. The local transport bifurcation underlying barrier formation is linked to the inverse cascade of 〈A^{2}〉 and negative resistivity, which induce local bistability. For small-scale forcing, spontaneous layering of the magnetic potential occurs, with barriers located at the interstices between layers. This structure is effectively a magnetic staircase.",Quenched disorder in the contact process on bipartite sublattices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108600,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"We study the effects of distinct types of quenched disorder in the contact process with a competitive dynamics on bipartite sublattices. In the model, the particle creation depends on its first and second neighbors and the extinction increases according to the local density. The clean (without disorder) model exhibits three phases: inactive (absorbing), active symmetric, and active asymmetric, where the latter exhibits distinct sublattice densities. These phases are separated by continuous transitions; the phase diagram is reentrant. By performing mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations we show that symmetric disorder destroys the sublattice ordering and therefore the active asymmetric phase is not present. On the other hand, for asymmetric disorder (each sublattice presenting a distinct dilution rate) the phase transition occurs between the absorbing and the active asymmetric phases. The universality class of this transition is governed by the less-disordered sublattice. Finally, our results suggest that random-field disorder destroys the phase transition if it breaks the symmetry between two active states.",Simultaneous unpinning of multiple vortices in two-dimensional excitable media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108599,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"There are many examples of excitable media, such as the heart, that can show complex dynamics and where control is a challenging task. Heavy means like a strong electric shock are nowadays still necessary to control and terminate ventricular fibrillation (VF). It is known that heterogeneities in an excitable medium can stabilize the activity, e.g., spiral waves can pin to such obstacles. This might also be a reason for the persistence of VF and the difficulty to control it. Previous studies investigated systems with a single pinned spiral wave and demonstrated how the spiral can be unpinned. In this article, we extend this case and investigate a generic excitable system with multiple pinned spiral waves. We describe a control technique that allows the simultaneous unpinning of pinned spiral waves. Apart from theoretical considerations, we provide numerical evidence that the proposed technique is superior to the underdrive pacing method that has reportedly high success rates when applied to a single pinned spiral.",Objective magnetic vortex detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108598,Physical review.

The integrated averaged current deviation, the normed difference of the current density at a point and the mean current density in the domain, integrated along a magnetic field line, is proved to be objective, i.e., invariant under rotations and translations of the observer. The method is shown to detect accurately the boundary of magnetic vortices in two-dimensional simulations, as well as magnetic flux ropes in three dimensions.",Exactly solvable model of gene expression in a proliferating bacterial cell population with stochastic protein bursts and protein partitioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108597,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Many of the existing stochastic models of gene expression contain the first-order decay reaction term that may describe active protein degradation or dilution. If the model variable is interpreted as the molecule number, and not concentration, the decay term may also approximate the loss of protein molecules due to cell division as a continuous degradation process. The seminal model of that kind leads to gamma distributions of protein levels, whose parameters are defined by the mean frequency of protein bursts and mean burst size. However, such models (whether interpreted in terms of molecule numbers or concentrations) do not correctly account for the noise due to protein partitioning between daughter cells. We present an exactly solvable stochastic model of gene expression in cells dividing at random times, where we assume description in terms of molecule numbers with a constant mean protein burst size. The model is based on a population balance equation supplemented with protein production in random bursts. If protein molecules are partitioned equally between daughter cells, we obtain at steady state the analytical expressions for probability distributions similar in shape to gamma distributions, yet with quite different values of mean burst size and mean burst frequency than would result from fitting of the classical continuous-decay model to these distributions. For random partitioning of protein molecules between daughter cells, we obtain the moment equations for the protein number distribution and thus the analytical formulas for the squared coefficient of variation.",Spectra of random networks with arbitrary degrees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108596,Physical review.

We also derive bounds on the position of the band edges of the spectrum, which are important for identifying structural phase transitions in networks.","Neural field theory of effects of brain modifications and lesions on functional connectivity: Acute effects, short-term homeostasis, and long-term plasticity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108595,Physical review. E,2019 05 21,"Neural field theory is used to predict the functional connectivity effects of lesions or other modifications to effective connectivity. Widespread initial changes are predicted after localized or diffuse changes to white or gray matter, consistent with observations, and enabling lesion severity indexes to be defined. It is shown how short-term homeostasis and longer-term plasticity can reduce perturbations while maintaining brain criticality under conditions where some connections remain fixed because of damage in the lesion core. The extent to which such effects can compensate for initial connectivity changes is then explored, showing that the strongest corrective changes are concentrated toward the edges of the perturbation if it is localized and its core is fixed. The results are applicable to inferring underlying connectivity changes and to interpreting and monitoring functional connectivity modifications after lesions, injury, surgery, drugs, or brain stimulation.",Subdiffusion in an external force field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108594,Physical review.

If the force acts on the subordinated process, it keeps working all the time; otherwise, the force just exerts an influence on the system at the moments of jump. Some common statistical quantities, such as the ensemble- and time-averaged mean squared displacements, position autocorrelation function, correlation coefficient, and generalized Einstein relation, are discussed to distinguish the effects of various forces and different patterns of acting. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equations are also presented.

We discuss the implications of this result for the interpretation of a recent experiment in which the growth of bacteria strains has been probed at the single-cell level."

E,2019 05 21,"The uplift of an initially flat elastic membrane by an upward viscous flow is investigated experimentally. The deformed shape of the membrane results from a balance between the flow pressure, the elastic response of the membrane, and the fluid weight. This last effect becomes non-negligible for a large enough deformed area. The usual theoretical approach supposes the presence of a prewetting film regularizing the viscous stresses according to Lister et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 154501 (2013)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.111.154501]. Nevertheless, in our experiments without prewetting films, the measurements are correctly described with this theory in the elastic regime. Microscale roughness of membranes could introduce an equivalent characteristic scale in the problem. An alternative explanation could be provided by the appearance of a fluid lag filled with gas, for which a new theoretical framework has been recently proposed by Ball and Neufeld [Phys. Rev. Fluids 3, 074101 (2018)2469-990X10.1103/PhysRevFluids.3.074101]. We compare the two approaches and find that both describe reasonably our experiments.

E,2019 05 21,"Reinforcement learning in multiagent systems has been studied in the fields of economic game theory, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics by developing an analytical understanding of the learning dynamics (often in relation to the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory). However, the majority of these analytical studies focuses on repeated normal form games, which only have a single environmental state. Environmental dynamics, i.e., changes in the state of an environment affecting the agents' payoffs has received less attention, lacking a universal method to obtain deterministic equations from established multistate reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work we present a methodological extension, separating the interaction from the adaptation timescale, to derive the deterministic limit of a general class of reinforcement learning algorithms, called temporal difference learning. This form of learning is equipped to function in more realistic multistate environments by using the estimated value of future environmental states to adapt the agent's behavior. We demonstrate the potential of our method with the three well-established learning algorithms Q learning, SARSA learning, and actor-critic learning. Illustrations of their dynamics on two multiagent, multistate environments reveal a wide range of different dynamical regimes, such as convergence to fixed points, limit cycles, and even deterministic chaos.",Large deviations of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations and random walks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108578,Physical review.

We observe a rather fast convergence in the larger than typical part to this limiting distribution. For the length L of LIS of random walks no analytical results are known to us.

What is the ethical significance of such inclusion benefits, particularly those nonmedical in nature, for research ethics committees' risk-benefit assessment of research studies? We argue that, unless participants are clearly mistaken in their perceptions, ethics committees should take these types of inclusion benefits into account, and we suggest a few ways this might look in practice."

Nevertheless, further knowledge is needed about prolonged eccentric exercise. This work sought to investigate the cardiovascular responses to prolonged constant-load eccentric compared to concentric cycling. Ten healthy males performed two 45-min exercise sessions of either concentric or eccentric cycling separated by a month and matched for heart rate during the first 5 min of exercise. Cardiorespiratory, autonomic nervous system and vascular responses were assessed at rest, and during exercise and recovery. During cycling, oxygen uptake, cardiac output and systolic blood pressure were similar but heart rate and diastolic blood pressure were greater whereas stroke volume was lower during eccentric than concentric cycling (118±21 vs. 104±10 bpm; 77±9 vs. 65±8 mmHg; 122±12 vs. 135±13 mL). Baroreflex and noradrenaline concentration were altered during eccentric cycling, and after eccentric exercise, vascular tone was greater than after concentric cycling. We observed increased cardiovascular strain and altered baroreflex activity during eccentric compared with concentric exercise, suggesting eccentric cycling triggers greater sympathetic activity.",SIOP-E-BTG and GPOH Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Low Grade Glioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108561,Klinische Padiatrie,2019 06 03,"Low grade gliomas (LGGs) constitute the largest, yet clinically and (molecular-) histologically heterogeneous group of pediatric brain tumors of WHO grades I and II occurring throughout all pediatric age groups and at all central nervous system (CNS) sites. The tumors are characterized by a slow growth rate and may show periods of growth arrest. Around 40% of all LGG patients can be cured by complete neurosurgical resection and are followed by close observation. In case of relapse, second resection often is possible. Following incomplete resection observation is recommended, as long as there is no radiologic tumor growth and the patient does not suffer from significant, tumor-related symptoms. This also applies to patients with a diagnosis of LGG on the basis of radiological criteria. By contrast, clinical worsening and / or radiologic progression are an indication to treatment with either chemo- or radiotherapy. Overall survival is around 90%, and many patients survive with residual tumor, i. e. they suffer from chronic disease. All patients need comprehensive neuro-oncological care, the principles and details of which are summarized in the current guidelines. These represent standard of care for diagnostic work-up (including neuroimaging and neuropathology), and for therapeutic decisions (including the indications to non-surgical treatment) as well as concepts for neurosurgical intervention, chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as surveillance and rehabilitation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of tourniquet use on short-term postoperative outcomes in the era of modern TKA. Our institutional database was utilized to retrospectively identify three cohorts (long, short, and no tourniquet) of consecutive patients after unilateral TKA with a single surgeon. These three groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey's tests. Primary endpoints being hemoglobin index (difference in preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin), inpatient narcotic use, surgical time, length of hospital stay (total hours and % day1 discharges), and distance ambulated prior to discharge. The no-tourniquet group used significantly less narcotic than the short-tourniquet (2.4 vs. 2.9 morphine equivalent/hour, p = 0.004) and long-tourniquet groups (2.4 vs. 3.4 morphine equivalents/hour, p < 0.001). The no-tourniquet group ambulated significantly further than patients in the short (108 vs. 57 feet, p < 0.001) and long (108 vs. 76 feet, p < 0.001) groups. Finally, the no-tourniquet group had significantly shorter duration of hospitalization than the long-tourniquet group in both hours in the hospital (35 vs. 57 hours, p < 0.001) and % postoperative day 1 discharge (57 vs. 12%, p < 0.001).

The purpose of this observational study was to determine the incidence of femoral component malrotation using posterior condylar axis (PCA) referencing. A total of 100 knees in 92 patients with varus gonarthritis of the knee undergoing primary TKA using a standard medial parapatellar approach were evaluated intraoperatively. After distal femoral resection, the standard femoral sizing guide referencing the posterior condylar axis was used to set femoral component rotation. This was then compared with both the transepicondylar (TEA) and trochlear anteroposterior axes (TRAx). Disparites were recorded and corrected in line with the epicondylar axis. Rotational adjustment for addition of further external rotation was made in 13 (13.0%) cases. In seven cases, the medial pin sites were raised between 1 and 3 mm, and in six cases, the lateral pin site was lowered between 1 and 3 mm (based on risk of notching the femoral cortex). It is critical to not rely exclusively on the PCA to confirm rotational positioning of the femoral component as predicted by posterior condylar referencing guides. Intraoperative adjustment and confirmation using the TEA and TRAx occurred in 13% of primary TKA cases, which might have, otherwise, had a significant effect on the clinical outcome.",Barbed Sutures in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Are They Really Useful? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108557,The journal of knee surgery,2019 05 20,"Bidirectional barbed sutures (BBSs) have recently been investigated in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The contrasting results from the scarce literature suggest that BBSs are safe, save time and money, and give results comparable to traditional sutures. The purpose of the study is to test the real effect of BBSs on closure time in TKA and assess the functional results as well as the complications related to them. It was a randomized controlled trial. Eighty-five patients undergoing primary TKA were assigned to receive traditional closure with Vicryl (V-group) or with BBSs (Q-group). The exclusion criteria were significant coronal deformity, flexion contracture, or the need for stem and/or augmentation. The closure time for the capsule and that for the subcutaneous layer were registered separately. Intraoperative incidences were recorded. The follow-up was up to 1 month, during which the range of motion (ROM), superficial or deep infection, and wound dehiscence were assessed. There was a significant reduction in the capsule layer (27 seconds; p = 0.02) and global time closure (51 seconds; p = 0.01) in the Q-group. No differences were found in the subcutaneous layer (24 seconds; p = 0.055). There were more intraoperative suture breakages in the Q-group, mainly in the subcutaneous layer (p < 0.001). No differences in terms of dehiscence, infection, and ROM were observed at the 1-month follow-up. BBSs allow for slightly faster wound closure than Vicryl during a TKA. However, the differences observed have minimal clinical repercussions. Moreover, no differences in the infection rate (deep or superficial), dehiscence, or ROM were found.",Use of Viscoelastography in Malignancy-Associated Coagulopathy and Thrombosis: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108555,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 06 03,"The relationship between malignancy and coagulopathy is one that is well documented yet incompletely understood. Clinicians have attempted to quantify the hypercoagulable state produced in various malignancies using common coagulation tests such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count; however, due to these tests' focus on individual aspects of coagulation during one specific time point, they have failed to provide clinicians the complete picture of malignancy-associated coagulopathy (MAC). Viscoelastic tests (VETs), such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), are whole blood analyses that have the advantage of providing information related to the cumulative effects of plasma clotting factors, platelets, leukocytes, and red cells during all stages of the coagulation and fibrinolytic processes. VETs have gained popularity in the care of trauma patients to objectively measure trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), but the utility of VETs remains yet unrealized in many other medical specialties. The authors discuss the similarities and differences between TIC and MAC, and propose a mechanism for the hypercoagulable state of MAC that revolves around the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex as it switches between activating the protein C anticoagulation pathway or the thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor coagulation pathway. Additionally, they review the current literature on the use of TEG and ROTEM in patients with various malignancies. Although limited research is currently available, early results demonstrate the utility of both TEG and ROTEM in the prediction of hypercoagulable states and thromboembolic complications in oncologic patients.",Circulating FGF21 Levels in Human Health and Metabolic Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108554,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2019 05 20,"Human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is primarily produced and secreted by the liver as a hepatokine.

Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common entity among the RASopathies, is characterized mainly by short stature, cardiac anomalies and distinctive facial features. Mutations in multiple RAS-MAPK pathway-related genes have been associated with NS and related phenotypes. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dysmorphic features suggestive of NS. One of them died in the neonatal period because of cardiac failure. Targeted sequencing revealed de novo MRAS variants, c.203C > T (p.Thr68Ile) and c.67G > C (p.Gly23Arg) as causative events. MRAS has only recently been related to NS based on the observation of two unrelated affected individuals with de novo variants involving the same codons here found mutated. Gly23 and Thr68 are highly conserved residues, and the corresponding codons are known hotspots for RASopathy-associated mutations in other RAS proteins. Functional analyses documented high level of activation of MRAS mutants due to impaired GTPase activity, which was associated with constitutive plasma membrane targeting, prolonged localization in non-raft microdomains, enhanced binding to PPP1CB and SHOC2 protein, and variably increased MAPK and PI3K-AKT activation. This report provides additional evidence that a narrow spectrum of activating mutations in MRAS represents another rare cause of NS, and that MRAS has to be counted among the RASopathy genes predisposing to HCM. Moreover, our findings further emphasize the relevance of the MRAS-SHOC2-PPP1CB axis in the control of MAPK signaling, and the contribution of both MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways in MRAS functional upregulation.",Forced oscillation measurements in the first week of life and pulmonary outcome in very preterm infants on noninvasive respiratory support.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108499,Pediatric research,2019 06 05,We aimed at investigating whether early lung mechanics in non-intubated infants below 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) are associated with respiratory outcome.,Late steps in bacterial translation initiation visualized using time-resolved cryo-EM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108498,Nature,2019 06 06,"The initiation of bacterial translation involves the tightly regulated joining of the 50S ribosomal subunit to an initiator transfer RNA (fMet-tRNAfMet)-containing 30S ribosomal initiation complex to form a 70S initiation complex, which subsequently matures into a 70S elongation-competent complex. Rapid and accurate formation of the 70S initiation complex is promoted by initiation factors, which must dissociate from the 30S initiation complex before the resulting 70S elongation-competent complex can begin the elongation of translation1. Although comparisons of the structures of the 30S2-5 and 70S4,6-8 initiation complexes have revealed that the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNAfMet can acquire different conformations in these complexes, the timing of conformational changes during formation of the 70S initiation complex, the structures of any intermediates formed during these rearrangements, and the contributions that these dynamics might make to the mechanism and regulation of initiation remain unknown. Moreover, the absence of a structure of the 70S elongation-competent complex formed via an initiation-factor-catalysed reaction has precluded an understanding of the rearrangements to the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNAfMet that occur during maturation of a 70S initiation complex into a 70S elongation-competent complex. Here, using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy9, we report the near-atomic-resolution view of how a time-ordered series of conformational changes drive and regulate subunit joining, initiation factor dissociation and fMet-tRNAfMet positioning during formation of the 70S elongation-competent complex. Our results demonstrate the power of time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy to determine how a time-ordered series of conformational changes contribute to the mechanism and regulation of one of the most fundamental processes in biology.","Racial Disparities, Outcomes, and Surgical Utilization among Hispanics with Esophageal Cancer: A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program Database Analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108497,Oncology,2019 05 20,Hispanic patients with esophageal cancer (EC) have racially disparate survival outcomes compared with white patients.,Decreased Bleeding Incidence with Direct Oral Anticoagulants Compared to Vitamin K Antagonist and Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Venous Thromboembolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108496,Acta haematologica,2019 05 20,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a recognized complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet the optimal pharmacologic anticoagulant is unknown.",Are Neonatal Trials Better Conducted and Reported over the Last 6 Decades?

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in EH remain unknown. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel promising biomarker for the disease. The purpose of the present study was to determine the expression of circRNAs in the blood of EH patients and to evaluate the performance of circRNA for early diagnosis of EH. A total of 178 subjects were recruited in the case-control study. Initial screening was done by using the Agilent human circRNA microarray followed by qRT-PCR validation. Finally, miRNAs were combined with circRNAs to create a new early prediction model for EH. The expression level of hsa_circ_0126991 in EH patients was significantly higher in comparison with healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Using the interaction of miR-10a-5p in combination with hsa_circ_0126991 led to a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.764, and combined area under the curve of 0.774 (95% CI: 0.705-0.843) for early diagnosis of EH.

While concerns regarding the use of organs from suboptimal deceased donors relate to the quality of the graft, donation from ""marginal"" LDs may pose potential harm to the donor. Subject of Review: Living kidney donation is a safe procedure, but is associated with a small risk of end-stage kidney disease in the long- term. When elderly subjects and those with comorbidities are considered, long-term post-donation data are missing, making decisions regarding donation from these populations challenging. Further, vague guidelines have led to a wide heterogeneity in the criteria for living donation from marginal donors across centers and individuals. A recent survey by Lafranca et al. [PLoS One 2017;12:e0181846] collected information from 331 members (mainly physicians) of the European Society of Transplantation regarding several expanded LD criteria. Median refusal rate for potential expanded criteria (ECD) LDs is 15% and the authors found significant differences across regions in Europe in the acceptance of donors with ECD. Some transplant specialists did also deviate from their own transplant center policy, mainly to consider donors with high body mass index. Second Opinion: The survey by Lafranca et al. [PLoS One 2017;12:e0181846] documents extreme variability in the criteria for marginal LD selection. Many centers are deviating from the few agreed upon guideline criteria and are considering individuals with hypertension and minors for kidney donation. Intriguingly, one-fourth of the surgeons even deviate occasionally from center policy, especially when the issue is donor obesity. By and large, these data indicate that transplant community has a generally open approach toward extension of criteria for living donation, but long-term follow-up studies are needed to draw solid conclusions and guidelines."

By combining a 1D cylindrical ring phased array with an expandable paraboloid or conical-shaped balloon-based reflector, the applicator can be controllably collapsed for compact delivery and deployed to mimic a forward-firing larger diameter concentric ring array with tight focusing and electronic steering capabilities in depth. Comprehensive acoustic and biothermal parametric studies were employed to characterize the capabilities of the applicator design as a function of transducer dimensions, phased array configuration, and balloon reflector geometry. Modeling results indicate that practical balloon sizes (43-57 mm expanded diameter), transducer array configurations (e.g., 1.5 MHz, 10 mm OD x 20 mm length, 8 or 16 array elements), and sonication durations (30 s) are capable of producing spatially-localized acoustic intensity focal patterns and ablative thermal lesions (width: 2.8-4.8 mm; length: 5.3-40.1 mm) in generalized soft tissue across a 5-100 mm depth range. Larger focal intensity gain magnitudes and narrower focal dimensions are attainable using paraboloid-shaped balloon reflectors with natural geometric focal depths of 25-55 mm, whereas conical-shaped reflectors (angled 45-55°) produce broader foci and extend electronic steering range in depth. A proof-of-concept phased array applicator assembly was fabricated and characterized using hydrophone and radiation force balance measurements and demonstrated good agreement with simulation. The results of this study suggest that combining small diameter cylindrical phased arrays with expandable balloon reflectors can enhance minimally invasive ultrasound-based intervention by augmenting achievable focal gains and penetration depths with dynamic adjustment of treatment depth.",An exploration of BCI performance variations in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using longitudinal EEG data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108477,Journal of neural engineering,2019 05 21,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables people to use direct measures of brain activity for communication and control.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 12,A significant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been revealed in our investigation on polycrystalline Nd0.5Dy0.5FeO3 below 30 K. Observed magnetization of the system at low temperature is 32% higher than the expected average magnetization of NdFeO3 and DyFeO3. Such an enhancement in the magnetization led to a large change in magnetic entropy (10.4 Jkg-1 K-1) at 4 K. The observed entropy change is remarkable considering the higher natural abundance of Nd compared to that of Dy and negligible MCE seen in case of NdFeO3. Theoretical calculations performed using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations on an Ising type spin model indicate that the high magnetocaloric effect is caused primarily by the ordering of rare-earth ions in C-type antiferromagnetic state in presence of molecular exchange field created by Fe ions.,Pressure-induced ferromagnetism and enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of bilayer CrI3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108475,Journal of physics.

However, the transition from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) state was achieved with the pressure and the band gap was decreased although the indirect band gap nature remains unchanged. We obtained a substantially enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with pressure. In the pristine AFM bilayer, both Cr and iodine atoms almost equally contributed to the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the contribution from the iodine atoms was almost four times larger than the Cr contribution with increasing the pressure. Particularly, the interface iodine atoms played a major role for the enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.

One of these parameters is related to a ratio between electron mobilities at zero field (a non-exchange scattering mobility [Formula: see text] and an exchange or spin dependent one [Formula: see text]). From Hall effect measurements [Formula: see text] was obtained, displaying a weak temperature dependence in accordance with highly n-doped ZnO while the extracted [Formula: see text] exhibits an anomalous T-dependence. On the other hand, our magnetoresistance data cannot be properly fitted using Kawabata's expression based on a weak-localization model.",Competing interactions in a long-range spin-lattice coupled model and tricriticality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108471,Journal of physics.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 11,"Nonequilibrium magnetic properties of oxygen-rich LaMnO3.21 nanoparticles have been investigated by comprehensive magnetic measurements. The composition falls in the metamagnetic canted spin region of the magnetic phase diagram. However, the zero-field-cooling memory effect and frequency-dependent AC susceptibility reveal a re-entrant glassy state at low temperature. In contrast to the super-spin glass or cluster glass that re-enter from the high-temperature ferromagnetic state in previous studies, analyses based on the power law and Vogel-Fulcher law indicate strongly a conventional spin glass nature. As the magnetic field increases, an anomalous enhancement of the irreversible temperature is observed, suggesting a field-induced nonequilibrium magnetic state. These results can be understood by considering the interaction between the antiferromagnetic clusters and the metamagnetic canted-spin matrix inside the nanoparticles.",Impact of intensity discretization on textural indices of [18F]FDG-PET tumour heterogeneity in lung cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108468,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 20,"Quantifying tumour heterogeneity from [18F]FDG-PET images promises benefits for treatment selection of cancer patients. Here, the calculation of texture parameters mandates an initial discretization step (binning) to reduce the number of intensity levels. Typically, three types of discrimination methods are used: lesion relative resampling (LRR) with fixed bin number, lesion absolute resampling (LAR) and absolute resampling (AR) with fixed bin widths. We investigated the effects of varying bin widths or bin number using 27 commonly cited local and regional texture indices (TIs) applied on lung tumour volumes. The data set were extracted from 58 lung cancer patients, with three different and robust tumour segmentation methods. In our cohort, the variations of the mean value as the function of the bin widths were similar for TIs calculated with LAR and AR quantification. The TI histograms calculated by LRR method showed distinct behaviour and its numerical values substantially effected by the selected bin number. The correlations of the AR and LAR based TIs demonstrated no principal differences between these methods. However, no correlation was found for the interrelationship between the TIs calculated by LRR and LAR (or AR) discretization method. Visual classification of the texture was also performed for each lesion. This classification analysis revealed that the parameters show statistically significant correlation with the visual score, if LAR or AR discretization method is considered, in contrast to LRR. Moreover, all the resulted tendencies were similar regardless the segmentation methods and the type of textural features involved in this work."

In this context, pollutant contributions from building materials have received increased attention in recent decades. This study examined the releases of metals, nonylphenols and phthalates from ten common building surface materials (installed in triplicates) into rainwater runoff from six rain events. The highest releases of metals were from copper and zinc sheets (average concentrations of 3090 μg/L Cu and 7770 μg/L Zn respectively), while other metal materials, e.g., Corten weathering steel, exhibited lower releases. PVC roofing released high concentrations of nonylphenols and phthalates (average concentrations of up to 26 μg/L nonylphenols and 455 μg/L Diisononyl phthalate, DINP) which have not been investigated in the earlier studies. Pollutant releases varied between events, likely because of weather conditions and rainfall characteristics.

In these lakes, microbial food webs are extremely important in Hg trophodynamics, being that the picophytoplankton fraction is a major entrance path of Hg2+ into pelagic food webs. This study analyzed the bioaccumulation of Hg2+ by the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. using the radiotracer 197Hg2+ and water from four Andean Patagonian lakes presenting a natural gradient of DOM concentration and quality. Hg2+ bioaccumulation by Synechococcus was calculated as the uptake of Hg2+ per biovolume unit (volume concentration factor VCF; pL μm-3). Hg uptake showed a wide variation (13 < VCF< 300 pL μm-3) in the natural DOC gradient tested (0.7-4 mg L-1; Hg2+/DOC ratio: 1.8-14 ng mg-1). The bioaccumulation of Hg2+ in Synechococcus decreased exponentially with DOC concentration. Differences in the quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) among lake water influenced also Hg2+ bioaccumulation. Naturally degraded DOM, with low molecular weight/size, promoted higher Hg uptakes in Synechococcus compared to humic DOM, rich in high molecular weight/size aromatic compounds, that retained Hg in the dissolved phase. In Andean Patagonian lakes picocyanobacteria are pivotal organisms in the Hg cycling, taking dissolved Hg2+ and transferring it to pelagic food webs, as well as fueling the benthic Hg pathway through sedimentation.",Fate and bioavailability of four conazole fungicides in twelve different arable soils - Effects of soil and pesticide properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108446,Chemosphere,2019 06 02,"The objective of this study is to characterize changes in the fate, behaviour and bioavailability of four conazole fungicides - CFs (prochloraz - PRO, tebuconazole - TEB, epoxiconazole - EPO, flusilazole - FLU) in 12 diverse agricultural soils in complex microcosm systems consisting of agriculturally-used fluvisols, plants (Lactuca sativa), earthworms (Eisenia fetida) and passive samplers (SPME, Empore™ discs, silicone rubber). Due to great variability of the data and other methodological problems, the in-matrix passive samplers failed to be indicators of pore-water concentration and (bio)availability/(bio)accessibility of CFs. A dissipation of all CFs followed the first order kinetics (usually after initial lag phase) with large span of resulting half-lives (7-670 d) depending on soils and compounds. In many soils, the model revealed the ending plateau, which indicates the non-degradable or slowly-degradable residues. The half-lives and the residues were generally higher for EPO and FLU, than for PRO and TEB. Greater but slower total dissipation of CFs was observed in soils with higher percentage of organic matter. Earthworm concentrations were highest at first sampling time (14 days) and considerably decreased afterwards often resulting in PRO concentration below LOQ. Earthworm uptake was influenced by amount of organic matter and soil texture. Accumulation to lettuce roots was generally higher than to leaves and differed greatly among CFs. Concentration shoot to root ratios were generally the lowest for FLU (0.04) and highest for TEB (0.37). PRO was not detected in lettuce leaves during experiment. The study brings new results on fate and bioavailability of CFs in soils."

This article estimates the short-term effect of retirement on cognitive performance of elderly Australians by exploiting the exogenous variation in retirement decisions induced by changes in social security eligibility rules. The empirical results show that on average retirement has a negative but modest effect on cognition, and the rate of cognitive decline with age is greater for men than women. The results for women display no significant effects on working memory and speed of information processing. The article further adds to the literature by providing evidence on the possible mechanisms through which retirement could affect individual's cognitive performance. We find that moving into retirement leads women to increase the time spent in mental and household activities, which may in part explain the modest effect we observe for women.","Evidences of trauma in adult African enslaved individuals from Valle da Gafaria, Lagos, Portugal (15th-17th centuries).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108434,Journal of forensic and legal medicine,2019 06 16,"The aim of this work is to discuss the frequency of traumatic bone injuries in a quite unique skeletal assemblage of enslaved people from Valle da Gafaria, Lagos, Portugal (15th-17th centuries). In all, 30 males, 58 females, and 15 individuals of unknown sex were included in the study. The skeletal remains were macroscopically observed for traumatic lesions. When present, the traumatic bone injuries were classified as having occurred ante or perimortem. The antemortem lesions were also studied through radiological analysis. Traumatic lesions were identified in 11 men (36.7%), 23 women (39.7%) and two individuals of unknown sex (13.3%). From these 36 individuals, 61.1% presented antemortem trauma, 25.0% perimortem trauma and 13.9% exhibited simultaneously ante and perimortem trauma. The mechanism of all traumatic injuries was blunt force trauma. From the 9965 analysed bones, 186 exhibited traumatic lesions (87 antemortem, 97 perimortem, and two with both ante and perimortem lesions). The bone more affected by antemortem trauma was the 5th right intermediate foot phalange (40.0%) and by perimortem trauma was the skull (11.4%), probably related to accidents and interpersonal violence, respectively. When analysed by sex, the only significant differences were found in the skull and the right 5th proximal foot phalanges, men (57.1%) presenting more lesions than women (15.4%).

Some interventions target circadian entrainment through modifying light exposure, but existing reviews of light interventions for sleep improvement include few studies in psychiatric populations. We examined effect of light interventions on sleep quality, duration and timing, and effect moderators. We included controlled studies in intrinsic circadian rhythm disorders (such as advanced or delayed sleep) and in neuropsychiatric disorders with assumed high prevalence of circadian dysregulation (such as affective and psychotic disorders). Articles were identified through database searching: 40 studies reporting 49 relevant intervention comparisons met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed improvements in sleep continuity (ES = -0.23, p = 0.000), self-reported sleep disturbance (ES = -0.32, p = 0.014), and advancement of delayed sleep timing (ES = -0.34, p = 0.010). Although the small number of studies limited meta-regression, evening light avoidance was associated with greater increase in total sleep time. Effects of light on sleep and circadian outcomes have received limited attention in studies in psychiatric disorders, but results were promising in these groups.

In the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), a high correlation between serum progesterone and fPM levels (r2 = 0.783) suggests that fPM can be used to monitor their reproductive function. We monitored fPM during the estrous cycle of 15 collared peccary females. Estrous cycles averaged 27.9 ± 4.5 days (n = 28), ranging from 21 to 36 days. The luteal phase was 22.2 ± 4.8 days and the inter-luteal phase was 4.3 ± 1.4 days. Mean concentration of fPM across pregnancy were not different from those found during the luteal phase (1230 ± 718 and 1265 ± 584 ng/100 mg dried feces, respectively), however, significant differences were found when luteal phase concentrations were compared only against fPM concentrations during late pregnancy. In addition, late pregnancy fPM concentrations (1893 ± 551 ng/100 mg) were also significantly higher than those in the early (639 ± 339 ng/100 mg) and mid (1134 ± 449 ng/100 mg) pregnancy. For females during the early post-partum period, fPM concentrations were significantly increased (243 ± 118 ng/100 mg) than those of non-cycling females (103 ± 89 ng/100 mg). The analysis of fPM is a simple, non-invasive methodology to detect the ovarian activity in the collared peccary; moreover, it provides a husbandry tool, which may be used to help understand how social structure may impact reproduction.",Polydatin and I-CBP112 protects early bovine embryo against nicotinamide-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108431,Theriogenology,2019 06 10,"The mammalian Sirtuin family of seven enzymes, members of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase family that modify histones via direct deacetylation, is involved in the regulation of many antioxidant and oxidative stresses. In the present study, we explored the effects of nicotinamide (NAM)-induced oxidative stress on the in vitro development of bovine embryos, on the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56ac) and on expression of apoptosis-related genes. Treatment with NAM (10, 20 or 40 mM for 24, 48 or 196 h) during IVC resulted in significantly decreased blastocyst formation (24 h: 38.8 vs. 33.1, 27.3 and 10.2%, with P > 0.05, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively; 48 h: 37.5 vs. 28.2, 13.4 and 0%, with P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively; 196 h: 35.8 vs. 23.4, 0 and 0%, with P < 0.05, respectively). Treatment with NAM (20 and 40 mM for 24 h) resulted in increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in 2-cell and blastocysts, and apoptotic cell numbers in blastocysts and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) in 2-cell embryos (P < 0.05). Polydatin (PD) and I-CBP112 rescued the 20 mM NAM-induced embryo developmental defects and reduced ROS levels and apoptotic cell numbers in blastocysts (P < 0.05).

Madan et al. (2018) [2] and Di Gregorio et al. (2016) [3]). While CC has occasionally been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, the vast majority of CC paradigms take place in an epithelial setting, and this will be the object of this review. The majority of studies on CC have been performed in fixed specimens; however, recent studies have analyzed this phenomenon using time-lapse microscopy and computer modelling, which has offered some insight on the cell population dynamics and quantitative aspects of CC. In addition, the ability of CC to modify cell population dynamics critically depends on the type of growth/renewal of the target tissue. In this context, the presence of stem cell compartments and their topology within epithelia, critically constrain the outcome of cell competition. Here we will review the quantitative and dynamic aspects of the cellular interactions that lead to CC and how the renewal modes of epithelial tissues determine the evolution of competing cell populations. We will also provide an overview on how these interactions affect tissue physiology during development, homeostasis, and tumor formation.",The quantification and regulation of microtubule dynamics in the mitotic spindle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108428,Current opinion in cell biology,2019 06 13,"Microtubules play essential roles in cellular organization, cargo transport, and chromosome segregation during cell division. During mitosis microtubules form a macromolecular structure known as the mitotic spindle that is responsible for the accurate segregation of chromosomes between the two daughter cells. This is accomplished thanks to finely tuned control of microtubule dynamics. Even small changes in microtubule dynamics during spindle formation and/or operation may lead to chromosome mis-segregation, chromosome instability and aneuploidy. These three events are directly correlated with human diseases like cancer and developmental defects. Precise measurements of microtubule dynamics in the spindle will allow us to discover new molecules involved in regulating microtubule dynamics and enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie mitosis and cancer emergence and development. Moreover, many chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment are targeted to microtubules, so continued investigation of their dynamics with utmost precision will facilitate the development of new drugs. Measuring microtubule dynamics in the spindle has been a difficult task until recently. With the development of new and gentler microscopic techniques, and new computer programs, we can perform better and more accurate measurements of microtubule dynamics during mitosis.",Comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of salicylic acid paste with a polyurethane wound dressing for the treatment of digital dermatitis lesions in dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108427,Research in veterinary science,2019 06 12,"There is little evidence of the efficacy of artificial polymers for controlling bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) as a major problem of intensive dairy productions worldwide. We therefore aimed to compare salicylic acid (SA)-based paste with a polyurethane (PU) wound dressing on a German Holstein dairy farm over a maximum 56-d period. On d 0, 109 ft with active BDD lesions from 109 cows were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: (1) SA group received a topical SA-containing paste and (2) PU group was treated with a PU wound dressing. Dressing changes were performed according to manufacturer's instructions until clinical cure (transition from active M1 or M2 to non-active M4 or healed M0 stages), whereby a clinical scoring of lesions was additionally conducted. Data from 100 ft could be analyzed (nSA = 54; nPU = 46). There was a significant reduction of the lesion score over time within each group (SA: d 0-d 14; PU: d 0-d 28, p < .05). Score differences between first (d 0) and second (SA: d 7; PU: d 14) as well as between first and third (SA: d 14; PU: d 28) evaluation did not differ significantly (p > .05). The proportion of clinically cured cows was higher in SA than in PU on d 14 (96.3 vs. 32.6%) as well as on d 28 (100 vs. 54.3%) after initial treatment (p < .05). Analysis of survival to cure in a Cox regression model showed that hazard ratio (HR) was higher for SA with PU as baseline (HR: 6.324, 95% CI: 3.625-11.033, p < .05). However, while BDD scores at enrollment did not differ between treatments (p > .05), PU had a significantly lower final BDD score (p < .05).

Samples of tuberculosis-suggestive lesions collected by FIS sanitary inspection routine in slaughterhouses from 11 Brazilian states were analyzed. Isolation was the most sensitive technique, 94.54% (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 90.09%-97.65%), qPCR was 64.69% (95% CrI 54.41%-74.15%) sensitive and ELISA IDEXX™ 26.74% (95% CrI 22.82%-30.97%). Tests' specificities were 98.19% (95% CrI 95.75%-99.45%), 93.49% (95% CrI 79.28%-99.66%), 95.53% (95% CrI 91.71%-98.02%) respectively. Despite its low sensitivity, ELISA IDEXX™ was able to identify positive samples that were not detected by the other techniques. These samples had high probability to be true positives given ELISA's positive predictive value. The correlations between qPCR and isolation were neither biologically nor statistically significant. The low sensitivity of the qPCR is a limiting factor to its use as a post-mortem diagnosis in bovine tuberculosis suggestive lesions. Its use could be recommended in situations of high prevalence, or in parallel association with other tests, such as ELISA IDEXX™. ELISA IDDEX™ should not be used as a unique test, or in substitution of the other tests, for the post-mortem diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis due to its sensitivity."

NH4+-N from HPAM hydrolysis was removed efficiently through short-cut nitrification and anoxic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratios of effluent reached 51-97, and TOC decreased only 2%-4%, providing potential for subsequent H2 and PHA production. The maximum yields of H2 (0.833 mL·mg-1substrate) and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) (465 mg·L-1) occurred at influent C/N ratio of 51. Substrate removal increased linearly with the activities of dehydrogenase and hydrogenase (R2 ≥ 0.990), and H2 yield rose exponentially with enzyme activities (R2 ≥ 0.989). The maximum PHA yield (54.2% VSS) occurred at the 42nd hour and influent C/N ratio of 97. PHA yield was positively correlated with substrate uptake. The change of H2-producing, PHA-accumulating and HPAM-degradating bacteria indicated that those functional microorganisms had synergistic effects on H2 production and substrate uptake, as well as PHA accumulation and substrate uptake.",Innovative upflow anaerobic sludge osmotic membrane bioreactor for wastewater treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108413,Bioresource technology,2019 06 03,"A novel upflow anaerobic sludge-forward osmotic membrane bioreactor was developed for simultaneous wastewater treatment, membrane fouling reduction, and nutrient recovery.

Clinically significant fatigue may represent one previously unexplored individual difference factor related to e-cigarette use patterns and e-cigarette specific cognitive processes. Fatigue reflects the experience of being tired, lacking energy, and feeling exhausted. Although fatigue is a normal bodily response, severe or chronic fatigue is maladaptive. Thus, the current study sought to evaluate clinically significant fatigue and its relation to perceived barriers for quitting e-cigarettes, perceived risks and perceived benefits of e-cigarette use, and e-cigarette dependence among 625 adult e-cigarette smokers (51.8% female, Mage = 34.91 years, SD = 10.29). Results indicated that severe fatigue was significantly related to greater perceived barriers to quitting (p < .001), perceived risks (p < .001) and perceived benefits (p < .001) of e-cigarette use, and greater e-cigarette dependence (p < .001); effects that were evident after adjusting for a range of other factors (e.g., combustible cigarette use, pain severity).

One of the important concerns of POPs exposure may lead to the adverse reproductive consequences including primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), but the limited evidence has been reported so far. Our case-control study was performed to explore the association between serum levels of selected POPs and risk for POI in a Chinese female population, including 157 cases and 217 healthy controls. Serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and serum levels of reproductive hormones [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol] were measured. The medians of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) were significantly higher in case sera than in controls. Higher concentrations of DL-PCBs and p,p'-DDT were significantly associated with elevated risk of POI. A dose-response relationship was observed between the sum of DL-PCBs (Σ6 DL-PCBs) and the risk of POI (p for trend = 0.003), with odds ratios for the second and third tertiles, compared with the first, of 1.31- (95% CIs: 0.67-2.57) and 3.15-fold (95% CIs: 1.63-6.10), respectively. Similar results were observed for the sum of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites (Σ2 p,p'-DDTs). In control women, FSH levels were negatively associated with PCBs exposure, while LH had a positive association with OCPs. In patients with POI, exposure to PCBs was correlated with higher levels of LH, whereas exposure to OCPs was associated with lower levels of AMH. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first provided evidence that exposure to PCBs and DDT could be the potential risk factors for POI in women.",Potential environmental risks of nanopesticides: Application of Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides to soil mitigates the degradation of neonicotinoid thiacloprid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108392,Environment international,2019 06 10,"Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides and organic insecticides are continuously applied to soil at a temporal interval, while knowledge about the impact of Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides on organic insecticides degradation is currently scarce, resulting in poorly comprehensive evaluation of the potential environmental risks of Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides. Herein, a commercial Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide formulation (NPF), the active ingredient of NPF (AI-NPF), the prepared Cu(OH)2 nanotubes (NT) with comparable morphology and size to AI-NPF, and CuSO4 were respectively applied to soil at normal doses (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg), followed by an application of neonicotinoid thiacloprid after an interval of 21 d, showing that NPF at doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) mitigated thiacloprid degradation compared to control and CuSO4. Furthermore, AI-NPF was the primary component that contributed to the mitigation effect of NPF, which was also validated by the NT. Large differences in the degradation efficiency of thiacloprid in sterilized and unsterilized soils with Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides suggested that biodegradation was the primary process responsible for thiacloprid degradation, especially as chemical degradation was negligible. Besides a decrease of thiacloprid bioavailability due to adsorption by Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides, we demonstrated that Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides changed soil microbial communities, reduced nitrile hydratase activity and down-regulated thiacloprid-degradative nth gene abundance, which thus mitigated thiacloprid biodegradation. Clearly, this study shed light on the potential environmental risks of Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide.",Status of lead accumulation in agricultural soils across China (1979-2016).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108391,Environment international,2019 06 10,"The first national-scale assessment of lead (Pb) contamination in agricultural soils across China was conducted based on >1900 articles published between 1979 and 2016. Pb concentrations, temporal and spatial variations, and influencing factors were analyzed. Children's blood lead levels (BLLs) were also estimated using the integrated exposure uptake biokinetic (IEUBK) model. Pb concentrations in different areas of China varied greatly, which was closely associated with the distribution of Pb-related industries, especially Pb-zinc mine smelting, non-ferrous polymetallic mine smelting, e-waste recycling, and leaded gasoline consumption. The year 2000 was a significant transition year for Pb concentrations, with a rapid increase pre-2000 and a subsequent slow upward trend. Pb concentrations were found to be strongly associated with indicators of economic and social development including gross domestic product (GDP), population size, and vehicle ownership. Leaded gasoline, coal combustion, and non-ferrous smelting were the main sources of atmospheric Pb during the different periods. Predicted BLLs were higher in South China than those in the north. This study details the overall Pb contamination status of agricultural soils in China, and thus provides insights for policymakers with respect to pollution prevention measures.",Adipose-derived stromal cell secretome reduces TNFα-induced hypertrophy and catabolic markers in primary human articular chondrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108390,Stem cell research,2019 06 14,"Recent clinical trials show the efficacy of Adipose-derived Stromal Cells (ASCs) in contrasting the osteoarthritis scenario. Since it is quite accepted that ASCs act predominantly through a paracrine mechanism, their secretome may represent a valid therapeutic substitute. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ASC conditioned medium (ASC-CM) on TNFα-stimulated human primary articular chondrocytes (CHs). CHs were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα and/or ASC-CM (1:5 recipient:donor cell ratio). ASC-CM treatment blunted TNFα-induced hypertrophy, reducing the levels of Osteocalcin (-37%), Collagen X (-18%) and MMP-13 activity (-61%). In addition, it decreased MMP-3 activity by 59%. We showed that the reduction of MMP activity correlates to the abundance of TIMPs (Tissue Inhibitors of MMPs) in ASC secretome (with TIMP-1 exceeding 200 ng/ml and TIMP-2/3 in the ng/ml range) rather than to a direct down-modulation of the expression and/or release of these proteases. In addition, ASC secretome contains high levels of other cartilage protecting factors, i.e. OPG and DKK-1. ASC-CM comprises cartilage-protecting factors and exerts anti-hypertrophic and anti-catabolic effects on TNFα-stimulated CHs in vitro. Our results support a future use of this cell-derived but cell-free product as a therapeutic approach in the management of osteoarthritis.",Immunomodulatory effects of orally administrated florfenicol in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) following experimental challenge with streptococcosis/lactococcosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108388,International immunopharmacology,2019 06 12,"The purpose of the present work was to determine whether florfenicol (FFC) as the prominent broad-spectrum antibiotic could affect serum biochemical and immunological parameters, as well as immune-related genes expression in rainbow trout (55 ± 7.6 g) challenged with the Lactococcus garvieae and Streptococcus iniae. In the first trial, the doses of the pathogens for challenge test were determined based on LD50. The therapeutic dosage of the drug (15 mg.kg-1 BW for 10 consecutive days) was administrated as medicated feed. After anesthesia, blood and kidney samples were collected from individual fish and were kept in deep freezing mode until the beginning of the measurements. Serum biochemical and enzymatic indices were measured using commercial kits. Immune parameters including total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme, ACH50, respiratory burst (RB), and phagocytic activities (PA) and the expression of immune genes namely TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and IgM was evaluated. The levels of lysozyme and RB activities, as well as the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β genes, showed a significant increase in the FFC treated/infected fish compared to untreated diseased fish (P < 0.05). In contrast, serum total immunoglobulin and IgM-related genes expression were suppressed following drug administration represented by a significant reduction in untreated streptococcal infected fish compared to other treatments (P < 0.05). However, no significant effect of FFC was observed on serum ACH50 activity, PA values and IL-8-related gene expression (P > 0.05). These results demonstrated that FFC treatment could improve some physiological status including stress resistance and some liver function parameters, and much innate immunity was invigorated, but at the same time, the suppressive effects of FFC on acquainted immunity cannot be ignored.",Irisin pretreatment ameliorates intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice through activation of the Nrf2 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108387,International immunopharmacology,2019 06 12,"Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a serious clinical event that may induce intestinal mucosal injury, whose major underlying mechanisms include reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, release of inflammatory mediators and induction of apoptosis. Irisin is considered an agent with potent protection against many pathological injures. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of irisin pretreatment on intestinal injury and explore its underlying mechanisms in a mouse model of intestinal I/R injury as well as a cell model (IEC-6 cell) of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). The results showed that irisin pretreatment ameliorated I/R and H/R-induced injury in vivo and in vitro. In addition, irisin reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin(IL)-1β and interleukin(IL)-6 in the intestine. Compared with the I/R group, irisin pretreatment effectively reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, but increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities in the intestine, and significantly reduced oxidative stress. Furthermore, irisin pretreatment downregulated Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 at the protein level, and increased Bcl-2 protein amounts, significantly reducing apoptosis in the intestine of I/R mice. Moreover, both in vivo and in vitro results showed that irisin pretreatment significantly upregulated nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) protein. Meanwhile, Nrf2 siRNA treatment partially abrogated the protective effects of irisin pretreatment on H/R induced cellular damage, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in IEC-6 cells. These findings suggest that irisin pretreatment improves I/R-induced intestinal inflammatory response, reduces oxidative stress and inhibits apoptosis, which could be, at least partially, associated with Nrf2 pathway activation.",Combination of metformin with sodium selenite induces a functional phenotypic switch of human GM-CSF monocyte-derived macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108386,International immunopharmacology,2019 06 12,"We evaluated the effects of metformin (Met, 1,1‑dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) combined or not with sodium selenite (Ss, Na2SeO3) on the functional activities of LPS-activated GM-CSF monocyte-derived macrophages (GM-MDM).",Individuals with mild-to-moderate hip osteoarthritis exhibit altered pelvis and hip kinematics during sit-to-stand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108385,Gait & posture,2019 05 31,Performance of the sit-to-stand (STS) task is compromised in individuals with advanced hip osteoarthritis (OA).

In addition to initial sperm quality, numerous steps can affect the final result of fertilization, from the sperm collection process until gamete mixing (or co-incubation) when the spermatozoon enters or fuses with the oocyte. In this review, we summarize the whole process of sperm handling, from collection until fertilization for fish, penaeid shrimp, bivalve mollusks and marine mammals. To obtain sperm from captive animals, techniques vary widely across taxa, and include stripping by abdominal massage or testis surgical removal in fish, spermatophore collection in penaeid shrimps, gonadal scarification or temperature shock in bivalve mollusks, and voluntary collection via positive reinforcement in mammals. In most cases, special care is needed to avoid contamination by mucus, seawater, urine, or feces that can either activate sperm motility and/or decrease its quality. We also review techniques and extender solutions used for refrigerated storage of sperm across the aforementioned taxa. Finally, we give an overview of the different protocols for in vivo and in vitro fertilization including activation of sperm motility and methods for gamete co-incubation. The present study provides valuable information regarding breeder management either for animal production or species conservation.",SIRT3 regulates cancer cell proliferation through deacetylation of PYCR1 in proline metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108370,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 11,"SIRT3 is a major mitochondrial deacetylase, which regulates various metabolic pathways by deacetylation; however, the effect of SIRT3 on proline metabolism is not reported. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) participates in proline synthesis process by catalyzing the reduction of P5C to proline with concomitant generation of NAD+ and NADP+. PYCR1 is highly expressed in various cancers, and it can promote the growth of tumor cells. Here, through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we found that PYCR1 is in SIRT3's interacting network. PYCR1 directly binds to SIRT3 both in vivo and in vitro. CBP is the acetyltransferase for PYCR1, whereas SIRT3 deacetylates PYCR1. We further identified that K228 is the major acetylation site for PYCR1. Acetylation of PYCR1 at K228 reduced its enzymatic activity by impairing the formation of the decamer of PYCR1. As a result, acetylation of PYCR1 at K228 inhibits cell proliferation, while deacetylation of PYCR1 mediated by SIRT3 increases PYCR1's activity. Our findings on the regulation of PYCR1 linked proline metabolism with SIRT3, CBP and cell growth, thus providing a potential approach for cancer therapy.","Benchmarking of several material constitutive models for tribology, wear, and other mechanical deformation simulations of Ti6Al4V.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108369,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 11,"Use of an alpha-beta (multiphase HCP-BCC) titanium alloy, Ti6Al4V, is ubiquitous in a wide range of engineering applications. The previous decade of finite element analysis research on various titanium alloys for numerous biomedical applications especially in the field of orthopedics has led to the development of more than half a dozen material constitutive models, with no comparison available between them. Part of this problem stems from the complexity of developing a vectorised user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT) and the different conditions (strain rate, temperature and composition of material) in which these models are experimentally informed. This paper examines the extant literature to review these models and provides quantitative benchmarking against the tabulated material model and a power law model of Ti6Al4V taking the test case of a uniaxial tensile and cutting simulation.",Wear behaviour of CFR PEEK articulated against CoCr under varying contact stresses: Low wear of CFR PEEK negated by wear of the CoCr counterface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108368,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 11,"Total hip replacement with metal-on-polymer hip prostheses is the most common treatment for late-stage osteoarthritis. However, the wear debris generated from the polymer acetabular liner remains a problem. Alternative materials with claimed superior wear properties have been proposed to overcome this problem. In this study, the wear behaviour of carbon fibre reinforced polyether ether ketone (CFR PEEK) was investigated under different contact stresses that are observed in the natural hip joint. A 50-station pin-on-disc machine (SuperCTPOD) was used to investigate the wear behaviour of 50 CFR PEEK pins articulated against cobalt chromium (CoCr) discs under five different contact stresses, namely 1.11, 1.38, 1.61, 2.00 and 5.30 MPa. The results showed that the wear rates of the pins did not differ significantly between groups under different contact stresses. In addition, CFR PEEK produced lower wear rates than ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and cross-linked polyethylene. However, the weight of the CoCr discs was found to decrease significantly at the end of the wear test, which was indicative of metallic wear. The findings of this study indicated that, despite having relatively low wear rates, CFR PEEK is not a good alternative to be utilised against orthopaedic metals.",Processing differences between monolingual and bilingual young adults on an emotion n-back task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108367,Brain and cognition,2019 06 11,"Bilingualism is associated with enhancement of executive control (EC) across the lifespan. Working memory and non-verbal emotion regulation both draw upon EC mechanisms so may also be affected by bilingualism, but these relationships are not fully understood. These relationships were explored using an n-back task with distracting emotional stimuli administered to young adults while continuous EEG was recorded. Monolinguals were faster but less accurate on the 2-back than bilinguals, and monolingual accuracy was more impeded by the presence of emotional stimuli than was that of bilinguals. The P300 event-related potential, a neural signature of working memory processing in the n-back, had smaller amplitudes in both groups on the 2-back than the 1-back, but attenuation in response to distracting emotional stimuli was greater for bilinguals than monolinguals. P300 latencies were also differentially affected by emotional stimuli in each group: Bilingual latencies were constant across emotions but monolingual latencies increased from neutral to angry conditions. In general, bilingual performance was less impacted by the emotional distraction than was that of the monolinguals. Additionally, bilinguals adjusted to the changing demands of the 1-back and 2-back conditions by recruiting neural networks to support different behavioral outcomes than monolinguals.",Alignment of the rearfoot and foot pressure patterns of individuals with medial tibial stress syndrome: A cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108366,Physical therapy in sport : official journal of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine,2019 06 11,"To compare the rearfoot alignment (leg-heel angle, LHA) during standing and walking, and foot pressure during walking between individuals with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) and asymptomatic individuals participating in daily sports.",Damage-induced voltage alteration (DIVA) contrast in SEM images of ion-irradiated semiconductors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108365,Ultramicroscopy,2019 05 29,"The ion-irradiation damage effects in semiconductors were directly visualized by means of scanning electron microscopy at low beam acceleration voltages (low-kV SEM). The Al0.55Ga0.45As (p-type and n-type) epitaxial layers grown over GaAs substrates were irradiated with energetic He+ ions with fluencies ranging from 8e12 to 8e13 cm-2 and studied in cross-sectional view after cleavage. Secondary electron images collected at low energy (0.5 - 1 keV) of primary electrons show strong contrast related to the local differences in the material resistivity resulting from the ion-induced damage. The main aim of the paper is to present, for the first time, the interpretation of the mechanism of SEM image contrast formation, which has been referred to as Damage-Induced Voltage Alteration (DIVA) contrast and is based on the charging effect in SEM. The unrivalled advantage of this imaging technique is the possibility of immediate two-dimensional visualization of damage effects without complex sample preparation.","Intergenerational understandings of personal, social and community assets for health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108364,Health & place,2019 06 04,"Connecting local citizens of different ages in productive social activity is considered a pathway towards greater health. This research explores how older adults and young people interpret and access assets from their geographical community in relation to their well-being and the extent to which a process of intergenerational bridging contributes to the creation of additional assets for health. Data is presented from a process of place-mapping, interviews, observations and arts-based approaches to: a) understand how personal, social and community assets supported perceived health and wellbeing for the young children and older adults who participated; and b) explore the impact of intergenerational connection on enhancing social capital. The research utilised bonding, bridging and linking forms of social capital, across several interactions amongst 41 individuals who reside in the same geographical community (Victoria, Australia). Assets for health, common across generations and located within the same geographical community were identified. Social connections were strengthened through conversations, reflections and an integration of ideas facilitated through an arts-based approach. Findings suggest that through intergenerational connection and sharing of resources to support health, including the sharing of community assets, progress can be made towards community strengthening with implications for health and wellbeing.",Chlorite formation during ClO2 oxidation of model compounds having various functional groups and humic substances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108363,Water research,2019 06 04,"Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been used as an alternative to chlorine in water purification to reduce the formation of halogenated by-products and give superior inactivation of microorganisms. However, the formation of chlorite (ClO2-) is a major consideration in the application of ClO2. In order to improve understanding in ClO2- formation kinetics and mechanisms, this study investigated the reactions of ClO2 with 30 model compounds, 10 humic substances and 2 surface waters. ClO2- yields were found to be dependent on the distribution of functional groups. ClO2 oxidation of amines, di- and tri-hydroxybenzenes at pH 7.0 had ClO2- yields >50%, while oxidation of olefins, thiols and benzoquinones had ClO2- yields <50%. ClO2- yields from humic substances depended on the ClO2 dose, pH and varied with different reaction intervals, which mirrored the behavior of the model compounds. Phenolic moieties served as dominant fast-reacting precursors (during the first 5 min of disinfection). Aromatic precursors (e.g., non-phenolic lignins or benzoquinones) contributed to ClO2- formation over longer reaction time (up to 24  h). The total antioxidant capacity (indication of the amount of electron-donating moieties) determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method was a good indicator of ClO2-reactive precursors in waters, which correlated with the ClO2 demand of waters. Waters bearing high total antioxidant capacity tended to generate more ClO2- at equivalent ClO2 exposure, but the prediction in natural water should be conservative.","Continuous ozonation of urban wastewater: Removal of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and antibiotic resistance genes and phytotoxicity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108362,Water research,2019 06 04,"This work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLA), ofloxacin (OFL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and tetracycline (TC)) from urban wastewater, by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 60 min) and specific ozone doses (i.e. 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 gO3 gDOC- 1). As expected, the efficiency of ozonation was highly ozone dose- and contact time-dependent. The removal of the parent compounds of the selected antibiotics to levels below their detection limits was achieved with HRT of 40 min and specific ozone dose of 0.125 gO3 gDOC- 1. The effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level, by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant E. coli, as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The inactivation of total cultivable E. coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of HRT 40 min and 0.25 gO3 gDOC-1, at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded. The regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of E. coli below the Limit of Quantification (<LOQ = 0.01 CFU mL- 1). Also, the abundance of the examined ARGs (intl1, aadA1, dfrA1, qacEΔ1 and sul1) was found to decrease with increasing HRT and ozone dose. Despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and/or death and prevent potential post-treatment re-growth of both total bacteria and ARB, and to reduce the abundance of ARGs below the LOQ. Interestingly, the mineralization of wastewater, in terms of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal, was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied, leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species. The findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process (e.g. specific ozone dose and contact time) taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated ARGs, as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties (e.g. DOC), in order to mitigate the spread of ARB&ARGs, as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity."

CircRNA Hippocampus Abundant Transcript 1 (circHIAT1) has been studied in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, whether it can regulate the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The expression level of circHIAT1 in HCC samples and cell lines was measured by qRT-PCR analysis. CircHIAT1 was expressed at a significantly low level in cancerous samples. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we determined a positive correlation between the downregulation of circHIAT1 and the poor overall survival of HCC patients. Using subcellular fractionation and RNA FISH assay, we identified the predominant cytoplasmic localization of circHIAT1. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the suppressive effect of circHIAT1 on the HCC cell growth. Mechanistically, circHIAT1 acted as the miR-3171 sponge to upregulate PTEN in HCC. Finally, rescue assays demonstrated the role of circHIAT1/miR-3171/PTEN pathway in regulating HCC cell growth. Taken together, this study revealed the novel mechanism of circHIAT1 in HCC.",Pancreastatin inhibitor activates AMPK pathway via GRP78 and ameliorates dexamethasone induced fatty liver disease in C57BL/6 mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108350,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 11,To investigate the role of pancreastatin inhibitor (PSTi8) in lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in dexamethasone induced fatty liver disease associated type 2 diabetes.,Ampelopsin inhibits human glioma through inducing apoptosis and autophagy dependent on ROS generation and JNK pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108349,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 11,"Glioma is the most common form of malignant brain cancer with high mortality rate in human. Therefore, finding effective therapeutic strategy and revealing the underlying molecular mechanism is necessary. Ampelopsin (Amp), an effective component of the traditional Chinese herb of Ampelopsis grossedentata, is reported to have important biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidant activity; however, its effects on human glioma are poorly understood. Here, the in vitro and in vivo study was performed to investigate the anti-glioma ability of Ampelopsin. Human glioma cell lines of U251 and A172 were treated with Ampelopsin (0, 25, 50, and 100 uM) for 24 h, followed by various analysis. And human glioma xenograft models were established by injecting U251, accompanied with administration of Ampelopsin at 50 and 100 mg/kg to confirm the anti-cancer role of Ampelopsin. We found that Ampelopsin could suppress the glioma cell proliferation by modulating G1 and S phase arrest. Incubation with Ampelopsin led to the activity of Caspase-8, Caspase-9, Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP), indicating that Ampelopsin induced apoptotic response via both intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. Additionally, autophagy was also observed in Ampelopsin-treated cancer cells, which is evidenced by autophagosome formation and LC3B-II accumulation. Ampelopsin-caused cancer cell death was obviously regained by apoptosis inhibitors. Further, Ampelopsin activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) expression and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Suppressing JNK markedly ameliorated Ampelopsin-induced apoptosis and autophagy, and ROS scavenger exhibited similar results. In vivo, Ampelopsin inhibited tumor growth and progression in mouse xenograft models. In conclusion, our findings indicated that Ampelopsin led to G1 and S phase arrest, triggered apoptosis and autophagy through potentiating ROS generation and JNK activation in human glioma cells. Thus, Ampelopsin might be a promising candidate against human glioma.",Effects of 10 weeks of military training on neuromuscular function in non-overreached and overreached conscripts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108348,Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,2019 06 09,"The purpose of the study was to examine how military training influences neuromuscular function in non-overreached and overreached conscripts. A total of 24 male conscripts participated in the study (8 weeks basic training + 2 weeks specialized training). All measurements were conducted during weeks 1, 5, 8 and 10. After the training period, non-overreached (NOR, n = 16) and overreached (OR, n = 8) groups were compared. Isometric maximal forces (bench press, elbow flexion and knee extension), single twitch (plantar flexors), H-reflex, M-wave (Hmax/Mmax) and V-wave (V/Mmax) (soleus) were measured. In knee extension, force production increased in NOR by 22.5 ± 20.5% (p < 0.01) between weeks 1 and 8, which was not observed in OR (-1.1 ± 18.2%, p > 0.05). In OR, plantarflexion twitch contraction time increased between weeks 5 and 10 by 82.2 ± 34.4% (p < 0.01), which was not observed in NOR. No changes were observed in the H-reflex and V-wave responses in either of the groups. In conclusion, short term overreaching can also reduce the performance of the neuromuscular system, however, it seems to be more muscle than neural based. To avoid overreaching, more individualized periodization should be used during basic training. To enhance neuromuscular performance, maximal and explosive strength training should also be added into the basic training program.",Three-dimensional kinematics of shoulder function in stroke patients: Inter- and intra-rater reliability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108347,Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,2019 06 09,"It is important to monitor progress during rehabilitation of stroke patients.

In this study, the effect of the exoskeleton on electromyographic (EMG) signals was investigated in four different lifting types (stoop, squat, freestyle and asymmetric) and two box weights (0% and 20% of body weight). Twelve young healthy adults ages 18-31 years (mean = 22.75, SD = 4.35) were participants. The EMG signals for twelve muscles (iliocostalis erector spinae (IL), longissimus erector spinae (LT), multifidus (MF), bicep femoris (BF), vastus lateralis (VL) and abdominal external oblique (AEO) muscles) were measured. The exoskeleton significantly decreased the peak and mean activity of back muscles (IL and LT) by 31.5% and 29.3%, respectively, for symmetric lifts and by 28.2% and 29.5%, respectively, for asymmetric lifts. The peak and mean EMG of leg muscles were significantly reduced by 19.1% and 14.1% during symmetric lifts, and 17.4% and 14.6% during asymmetric lifts. Although the exoskeleton reduced the activation of back and leg muscles, it slightly increased the activity of external oblique muscles, although this was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the exoskeleton is promising as a lift-assist device for manual material handlers and workers performing repetitive lifting.",Can the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) differentiate treatment-resistant from non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia?

However, few studies have investigated their PANSS symptom dimensions by Exploratory (EFA) or Confirmatory (CFA). Data from the present study are derived from 1429 patients of the Pattern study. TRS was defined by the use of clozapine in the previous year whereas NTRS by the use of non-clozapine antipsychotics (""by proxy""). Factors were chosen based on the Kaiser criterion and considered valid when loadings were greater than or equal to 0.5. The fit to the data was evaluated by CFA in comparison with well-established PANSS models, using fit indexes. The EFA yielded similar five-factor model in both groups: Negative, Positive, Anxiety/Depression, Cognitive and Excited. CFA showed a satisfactory, but not perfect, fit to the data, as compared with the previous PANSS factor analytic models. Despite the limitations regarding the 'by proxy' definition of TRS, the results of the present study show that there are no differences in the factorial structure of PANSS in patients with TRS and NTRS.",Addition of Advanced Practice Providers May Improve ABSITE Scores Through Enhanced Resident Education.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108344,The Journal of surgical research,2019 06 03,Resident work hour restrictions and required protected didactic time limit their ability to perform clinical duties and participate in structured education.

As a unique reaction-triggering and morphology-directing agent, HMDS is introduced for the first time to trigger the room-temperature reaction for generating perovskite NCs with controlled morphology and optical properties. Particularly, the stability of the resulting NCs is greatly enhanced due to the surface modification by hydrophobic -CH3 groups from HMDS. The typical CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs films are highly stable without significant decrease in photoluminesence (PL) intensity after being exposed to 60% relative humidity for 720 h. Moreover, no noticeable change of phase and morphology occurs even after 100 days of exposure. The representative CsPbBr3 NCs are employed in a prototype white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) on 365 nm commercial GaN chip. The present strategy provides a facile and versatile route not only to control the morphology and optical properties of perovskites nanomaterials at room temperature but also enhance their stability, which will bring promising potential application for optoelectronics.","The incidence, characteristics, outcomes and associations of small short-term point-of-care creatinine increases in critically ill patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108326,Journal of critical care,2019 05 22,"We assessed the incidence, characteristics, outcomes and associations of small, short-term point-of-care creatinine increases in critically ill patients.",Changes of plasma acetylcholine and inflammatory markers in critically ill patients during early enteral nutrition: A prospective observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108325,Journal of critical care,2019 05 22,"Acetylcholine (Ach) is the key anti-inflammatory transmitter in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.

Sample preparation was simple and fast which consisted of one-step protein precipitation using acetonitrile. Testosterone was used as an internal standard. HyPurity Advance column was used to develop the chromatography method using 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile as mobile phases by gradient elution. APCI positive ion mode was used for mass spectrometric detection.

Untargeted metabolomics approaches using one-dimensional gas chromatography (GC) are limited due to the chemical complexity of urine, which poorly detects co-eluting low-abundance analytes. Metabolite detection and identification can be improved by applying comprehensive two-dimensional GC, allowing for the discovery of additional viable biomarkers of disease. In this work, we applied comprehensive two-dimensional GC coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) to the analysis of urine samples collected daily across 28-days from 10 healthy female subjects for a personalized approach to female reproductive health monitoring. Through this analysis, we identified 935 unique volatile metabolites. Two statistical methods, a modified T-statistic and Wilcoxon Rank Sum, were applied to analyze differences in metabolome abundance on ovulation days as compared to non-ovulation days. Four metabolites (2-pentanone, 3-penten-2-one, carbon disulfide, acetone) were identified as statistically significant by the modified T-statistic but not the Rank Sum, after a false-discovery rate of 0.1 was set using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Subsequent analyses by boxplot indicated that the putative volatile metabolic biomarkers for fertility are expressed in increased or decreased abundance in urine on the day of ovulation. Individual analysis of metabolome expression across 28-days revealed some subject-specific features, which suggest a potential for long-term, personalized fertility monitoring using metabolomics.",Targeted Transgene Activation in the Brain Tissue by Systemic Delivery of Engineered AAV1 Expressing CRISPRa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108320,Molecular therapy.

We then evaluated the performance of these constructs in two reporter assays (bioluminescent and fluorescent), five endogenous genes (Camk2a, Mycn, Nrf2, Keap1, and PDGFRA), and two cell lines (neuro-2a [N2a] and U87) by targeting the promoter and/or enhancer regions.

One of its consequences, plastic pollution is considered one of the major threats to fauna as well as a significant conservation issue. In this research, we examined the global pattern of one example of avian behavior in response to pollution-namely, the incorporation of anthropogenic materials into nests-as well as the existing knowledge on this subject. Based on 25 articles, we studied 51 populations, involving 24 bird species, and checked 10,790 nests; as a result, we found that incorporation of debris is correlated with increasing human influence on the environment, measured as the Human Footprint Index. Moreover, the probability of debris incorporation is higher in terrestrial than in marine species. We also identified knowledge bias in favor of marine as opposed to terrestrial species: namely, marine species attract more scientific attention than terrestrial. Furthermore, research approaches to these two ecosystems differ. Undeniably, the factors which influence debris incorporation by birds, the scale of this behavior, and particular forms of use of debris in bird nests are aspects which require long-term standardized research. This is the first global review paper on debris incorporation by birds to demonstrate a close link to human pressure as a driver.",The association between prenatal cadmium exposure and birth weight: A systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108303,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between prenatal cadmium (Cd) exposure and birth weight. PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases were searched for studies published before March 2019. We used a model-based method, standardizing effect size from linear regression models to include a maximum number of studies during our quantitative evaluations. As a result, 11 articles from the general population, containing 10 birth cohorts and one cross-sectional study, were included. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that a 50% increase of maternal urine Cd (UCd) would be associated with a 6.15 g decrease in neonatal birth weight (β = -6.15 g, 95% CI: -10.81, -1.49) as well as a 50% increase of maternal blood Cd (BCd) would be associated with an 11.57 g decrease (β = -11.57 g; 95% CI: -18.85, -4.30). Stratified analysis of UCd data indicated that the results of female newborns were statistically significant (β = -8.92 g, 95% CI: -17.51, -0.34), as was the first trimester (β = -11.34 g, 95% CI: -19.54, -3.14). Furthermore, increased UCd levels were associated with a higher rate of low birth weight (LBW) risk (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.22). This meta-analysis demonstrated that elevated maternal Cd levels are associated with decreased birth weight and higher LBW risk.",Deoxynivalenol induced apoptosis and inflammation of IPEC-J2 cells by promoting ROS production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108302,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) frequently detected in a wide range of foods and feeds, inducing cytotoxicity to animals and humans. To investigate the underlying mechanism of DON-induced apoptosis and inflammation in porcine small intestinal epithelium, intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) were chosen as objects, and were treated by different concentrations (0 μg/mL, 0.2 μg/mL, 0.5 μg/mL, 1.0 μg/mL, 2.0 μg/mL, 4.0 μg/mL, 6.0 μg/mL) of DON. The results showed that DON induced cytotoxicity of IPEC-J2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which is demonstrated by decreasing cell viability. Compared with the control group, DON treatment increased the expressions of genes associated with inflammation and apoptosis, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and decreased the cell anti-oxidative status. Protein immunofluorescence showed increased expression of caspase-3, nuclear factor kB (NF-κB) and phosphorylated NF-κB in IPEC-J2 cells. DON increased the content of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of IPEC-J2 cells. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a commonly used antioxidant, blocked DON-induced ROS generation, alleviated the DON-induced apoptosis and inflammation. These results suggested that DON-induced impairment of IPEC-J2 cells is possibly due to increased ROS production, and expressions of genes and proteins associated with apoptosis and inflammation.",Organochlorine concentrations in aquatic organisms from different trophic levels of the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem and their implications for human consumption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108301,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"The Sundarbans, a highly biodiverse tropical ecosystem stretching across India and Bangladesh, is also the largest mangrove forest in the world. Organochlorine compounds (OCs) have been extensively used for agriculture and sanitary purposes in the region. OCs can accumulate in biological tissues and biomagnify in organisms through food webs, for which reason they reach high concentrations in top predators. Because marine food webs are long and marine predators are extensively used in the region as human food, assessment of potential health-related risks caused by OC pollution is in order. This study is the first to determine the concentration of PCBs in fish and crustaceans from the Sundarbans mangroves, their accumulation trends through the food web, and the potential toxicological risk that their consumption poses to humans. DDT concentrations, which had already been assessed in the region, were also determined. The median concentrations ranged from below detection limits to 176.3 ng g-1 lipid weight for tDDT and 275.9  ng g-1 for PCBs. Overall, these concentrations were lower than those usually observed in other regions of the world, apparently as a result of the interplay of several factors: low environmental organochlorine inputs, the physical and climatic characteristics of an ecosystem dominated by high temperatures in a highly flushed ecosystem that dilutes and rapidly disperses pollutants, and the comparatively short food chain lengths that, similarly to other mangrove ecosystems, characterize the Sundarbans. Organochlorine concentrations were 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than commonly accepted tolerance levels, so their consumption do not pose a sensible risk to the population. However, concentrations of DDT in dry fish from retail markets were higher because this compound is used for pest control during fish processing. Potential risks involved in this practice likely outweigh potential benefits, so it is recommended that this compound is substituted by less hazardous alternatives.",Nitrate addition promotes the nitrogen cycling processes under the co-contaminated tetrabromobisphenol A and copper condition in river sediment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108299,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and copper (Cu) are the main pollutants at e-waste recycling sites and the effects of their biotoxicity on microorganisms have drawn extensive attention. Nitrate-based bioremediation has been applied to organic pollutant-contaminated sediments since nitrate is a favorable electron acceptor for microbes. However, the effects of TBBPA and Cu on nitrogen (N)-cycling microorganisms and bioremediation in co-contaminated sediments remain unclear. Thus, our study examined the effects of TBBPA and Cu with/without nitrate addition on the TBBPA biodegradation efficiencies, microbial activities, and N functional genes. It was found the biodegradation efficiencies of TBBPA were improved by the nitrate addition from 34.7% to 59.3% and from 22.6% to 42.8% in the TBBPA and TBBPA-Cu contaminated groups, respectively. The inhibitions of the catalase activity increased with the nitrate addition because of the anaerobic respiration of the microorganisms. In addition, the potential denitrification rate exhibited an increasing trend from 6.46 to 8.23 mg-N kg-1 dry sediment day-1 during the period of 15-90 days after adding nitrate to the co-contaminated group, whereas the potential nitrification rate exhibited an opposite trend and decreased from 4.47 to 3.19 mg-N kg-1 dry sediment day-1. The denitrification gene abundances of the N-cycling genes were 107-108 orders of magnitude higher and significantly increased in the nitrate addition groups. The amoA gene abundances were lower than the denitrification gene abundances and were 105-106 orders of magnitude in the same groups. Moreover, the interaction types of the pollutants on the gene abundances were changed from synergistic to antagonistic as nitrate addition. Our study emphasized the gap of knowledge on nitrate addition affecting N-cycling microbes in the combined pollutants exposure sediments, and will be helpful for further bioremediation in different contaminated scenarios.",NH4H2PO4-extractable arsenic provides a reliable predictor for arsenic accumulation and speciation in pepper fruits (Capsicum annum L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108298,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Dietary arsenic (As) intake from food is of great concern, and developing a reliable model capable of predicting As concentrations in plant edible parts is desirable. In this study, pot experiments were performed with 16 Chinese upland soils spiked with arsenate [As(V)] to develop a predictive model for As concentrations in pepper fruits (Capsicum annum L.). Our results showed that after three months' aging, concentrations of bioavailable As (extracted by 0.05 M NH4H2PO4) in various soils varied widely, depending on soil total As concentrations and soil properties such as soil pH and amorphous iron (Fe) contents. Furthermore, both the bioconcentration factor (BCF, denoted as the ratio of fruit As to soil As) and total As concentrations in pepper fruits were largely determined by concentrations of bioavailable As, which explained 27% and 69% variations in the BCF and fruit As concentrations, respectively. Apart from bioavailable As, soil pH and Fe contents were another two important factors influencing As accumulation in pepper fruits. Taking the three factors into account, concentrations of fruit As can be well predicted using a stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) analysis (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.17). Arsenic species in soils and edible parts were also analyzed. Although As(V) predominated in soils (>96%), As in pepper fruits presented as As(V) (46%) and arsenite [As(III)] (39%) with small amount of methylated As (<15%). Aggregated boosted tree (ABT) analysis revealed that inorganic As concentrations in pepper fruits were determined by concentrations of bioavailable As, phosphorus (P) and Fe in soils. In contrast to inorganic As, methylated As concentrations were not correlated with those factors in soils. Taken together, this study established an empirical model for predicting As concentrations in pepper fruits. The predictive model can be used for establishing the As threshold in fruit vegetable farming soils.",Atrazine induced transgenerational reproductive effects in medaka (Oryzias latipes).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108297,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Atrazine is presently one of the most abundantly used herbicides in the United States, and a common contaminant of natural water bodies and drinking waters in high-use areas. Dysregulation of reproductive processes has been demonstrated in atrazine exposed fish, including alteration of key endocrine pathways on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. However, the potential for atrazine-induced transgenerational inheritance of reproductive effects in fish has not been investigated. The present study examined the effects of early developmental atrazine exposure on transgenerational reproductive dysregulation in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). F0 medaka were exposed to atrazine (ATZ, 5 or 50 μg/L), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2, 0.002 or 0.05 μg/L), or solvent control during the first twelve days of development with no subsequent exposure over three generations. This exposure overlapped with the critical developmental window for embryonic germ cell development, gonadogenesis, and sex determination. Exposed males and females of the F0 generation were bred to produce an F1 generation, and this was continued until the F2 generation. Sperm count and motility were not affected in F0 males; however, both parameters were significantly reduced in the males from F2 Low EE2 (0.002 μg/L), Low ATZ (5 μg/L), and High ATZ (50 μg/L) lineages. Fecundity was unaffected by atrazine or EE2 in F0 through F2 generations; however, fertilization rate was decreased in low atrazine and EE2 exposure lineages in the F2 generation. There were significant transgenerational differences in expression of the genes involved in steroidogenesis and DNA methylation. These results suggest that although early life exposure to atrazine did not cause significant phenotypes in the directly exposed F0 generation, subsequent generations of fish were at greater risk of reproductive dysfunction.",Ecological risks of insecticide contamination in water and sediment around off-farm irrigated rice paddy fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108296,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"The ecological impacts of insecticides in aquatic areas around agricultural lands have long been ignored in the regulation scheme of pesticides in Japan. Upon the scheme, the predicted concentration of an insecticide in the main stream of a river is the only parameter considered, suggesting that the ecological impacts of insecticides on local biodiversity around agricultural fields are underestimated. To fill this knowledge gap, we measured insecticide concentrations in surface water and sediment in aquatic areas around paddy fields at 35 locations across Japan. Among the 18 insecticides considered, 15 were detected somewhere in Japan and their concentrations were generally higher in the southwestern region in Japan (e.g. Hiroshima, Saga, or Kagoshima prefectures). Most insecticides were accumulated at higher concentrations in sediment than in surface water, consistent with previous studies. We also detected insecticides applied to nursery boxes at high concentrations in surrounding aquatic areas, although such application is generally considered to have low environmental risks. In addition, derivatives of fipronil, which have similar toxicity as that of fipronil, were often detected in sediment at higher concentrations than fipronil itself. Concentrations of dinotefuran in water at two sampling points were higher than the 5% hazardous concentration (HC5), indicating a possibility of a risk of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. Our findings indicate that ecological risk assessments of insecticides and their derivatives should be expanded to include concentrations in sediment and water around paddy fields as well.",Dissemination of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli carrying mcr-1 among multiple environmental sources in rural China and associated risk to human health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108295,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Antibiotic resistance among gram-negative bacteria is increasingly becoming a problem of global concern. Particularly problematic is the emergence of resistance to last-resort antibiotics such as carbapenems and colistin. The increasing number of reports on the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in isolates worldwide is raising concerns for the future usefulness of this class of antibiotics. Dissemination of mcr-1 is believed to have originated mainly from animal breeding, however, the role of the environment as a transmission source is not yet fully understood. In the current study, 89 extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolated from 231 samples from different environmental sources in 12 villages in a rural area of Shandong, China, were screened for mcr-1. 17 (19.1%) mcr-1-positive isolates were found from different environmental sources, aggregated in 6 villages. Plasmids of three different Inc-groups carrying mcr-1 were confirmed, indicating that the widespread geographical distribution of mcr-1 in the local area is due to a number of different plasmids. Additionally, almost a third (29.4%) of the isolates carried virulence factors associated to intestinal pathogenic E. coli. These results illustrate the high complexity of the transmission patterns of mcr-1 among different environmental matrices on a local scale and the potential for the environment to facilitate dissemination and emergence of antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains of bacteria.","Semi-volatile organic compounds in infant homes: Levels, influence factors, partitioning, and implications for human exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108294,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"While infants are developing, they are easily affected by toxic chemicals existing in their environments, such as semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs): phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organophosphate esters (OPEs). However, the specific living environment of infants, including increased plastic products and foam floor mats, may increase the presence of these chemicals. In this study, 68 air, dust, and window film samples were collected from homes, with 3- to 6-month-old infant occupants, to analyze phthalates, PAHs, PBDEs, and OPEs. High detection rates and concentrations suggest that these SVOCs are widespread in infant environments and are associated with cooking methods, smoking habits, the period of time after decoration, and room floors. The partitioning behavior of SVOCs indicates that the logarithms of the dust/gas-phase air partition coefficient (logKD) and the window film/gas-phase air partition coefficient (logKF) in homes are not at an equilibrium state when the logarithm of the octanol/air partition coefficient (logKOA) is less than 8 or greater than 11. Considering the 3 exposure routes, ingestion and dermal absorption have become the main routes of infant exposure to phthalates and OPEs, and ingestion and inhalation have become the dominant routes of exposure to PAHs and PBDEs. The total carcinogenic risk of SVOCs, which have carcinogenic toxicities, via ingestion and dermal absorption for infants in homes exceeds the acceptable value, suggesting that the current levels of these SVOCs in homes might pose a risk to infant health."

This synergistic PTT/PDT/CT platform consists of three components: i) the Pluronic-polyethylenimine assembling into micelles to encapsulate drugs and providing reduction sites for gold cage formation through a ""green"" method, ii) the gold cage with surface plasmon resonance peak at near-infrared (NIR) region in a broad window qualifying the PTT/PDT potentiality, iii) a chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX) arresting the tumor cell cycle. As demonstrated, the system has remarkable performance on controlling drug release, blocking TRPV6 cation channel, enhancing cell cycle arrest, elevating temperature and generating ROS, thus improving cellular toxicity along with apoptosis, enhancing tumor targeting, and achieving the therapy to ARPC with low toxicity on liver function and minimal side effects to normal organs. Notably, both PTT and PDT effect are generated under single irradiation situation because of the broad absorbance window, along with limited skin damages. As a specific synergistic platform creatively integrating multiple treatment protocols with negative toxicity, PTX-PP@Au NPs provide a facile, effective, and broadly applicable strategy to deadly ARPC.",Ticagrelor in patients with heart failure after acute coronary syndromes-Insights from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108273,American heart journal,2019 05 29,"Heart failure (HF) following acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is associated with worse prognosis; however, the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in patients with HF and if ticagrelor influences the risk of new-onset HF are unknown.",Early postmortem interval (EPMI) estimation using differentially expressed gene transcripts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108272,"Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 16,"Genes differentially expressed after death were selected to construct a mathematical model for early postmortem interval estimation.

Yet, their environmental impacts along the full supply chains are scarcely known. Therefore, this paper provides for the first time a comprehensive evaluation of the life cycle environmental impacts of vegetables consumed in UK. The impacts are assessed for 56 fresh and processed products produced domestically and imported from abroad, considering both the product and sectoral levels. At the product level, taking into account the market mix of fresh and processed vegetables for each vegetable type sold in the UK, asparagus has the highest per-kg impacts across most of the 19 impact categories considered, while cabbage, celery and Brussels sprouts are generally environmentally most sustainable. At the sectoral level, the annual consumption of 10.8 t of vegetables generates 20.3 Mt CO2 eq., consumes 260.7 PJ of primary energy and depletes 253 Mt eq. of water. The majority of the impacts are caused by potatoes since they account for 56% of the total amount of vegetables consumed, with crisps and frozen chips contributing most to the total impacts. Importing vegetables grown in unheated greenhouses in Europe has a lower impact than UK vegetables cultivated in heated greenhouses, despite the transportation. The impacts of air-freighted fresh vegetables are around five times higher than of those produced domestically. Even processed products have lower impacts than fresh air-freighted produce. Packaging also contributes significantly to the impacts, in particular glass jars and metal cans used for processed vegetables. Other significant hotspots are open display cabinets at the retailer and cooking of vegetables at home. The results of this study will be useful for food manufacturers, retailers and consumers, helping to identify improvement opportunities along vegetables supply chains."
