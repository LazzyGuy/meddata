Its prevalence is fueled by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is now widespread and poses a serious clinical threat. This study investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates, and associated factors of urinary tract infections among HIV-positive adult patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 randomly selected HIV-positive patients at Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital from February to March 2016. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Clean-catch midstream urine samples were collected aseptically and examined using the recommended culture methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21.0. The logistic regression models were used to explore the predictors of the outcome. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The overall prevalence of urinary tract infection was 18% (95% CI: 15.34-22.63). Individuals with age 35-44 years (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.07; 95% CI: 1.09, 5.10), income less than 46.7 USD (AOR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.15, 6.07), and a CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3 (AOR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.15, 3.73) had higher odds of UTI. Escherichia coli (38.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%) were the predominant causes of urinary tract infection. E. coli was resistant to ampicillin (95.8%), ceftazidime (95.8%), cotrimoxazole (95.8%), amoxicillin (91.7%), ceftriaxone (87.5%), and tetracycline (87.2%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 46% of the isolates. The prevalence of urinary tract infection in this study was high compared to the previous reports in Ethiopia. Age 35-44 years, income less than 46.7 USD, and a CD4+ count < 200 cells/mm3 increase the odds of urinary tract infection. The most common isolates were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus.

While the first tenet has recently come under severe attack, the second has been more resistant to change. I argue that we have good reasons to reject it on the basis of theoretical models that provide how-possibly explanations. These models, while they do not explain in the strict (narrow KAU) sense, afford understanding. In response, I propose an alternative epistemology of understanding, broad KAU, that takes cases of theoretical modelling into account.",Persuasion with Limited Sight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881528,Review of philosophy and psychology,2019 03 18,"Humans face many game problems that are too large for the whole game tree to be used in their deliberations about action, and very little is understood about how they cope in such scenarios. However, when a human player's chosen strategy is conditioned on her limited perspective of how the game might progress (Degremont et al. 2016), then it should be possible to manipulate her into changing her planned move by mentioning a possible outcome of an alternative move. This paper demonstrates that human players can be manipulated this way: in the game The Settlers of Catan, where negotiation is only a small part of what one must do to win the game thereby generating uncertainty about which outcomes to the negotiation are good and which are bad, the likelihood that a player accepts a trade offer that deviates from their declared preferred strategy is higher if it is accompanied by a description of what that trade offer can lead to.",High Expression of ANXA2 Pseudogene ANXA2P2 Promotes an Aggressive Phenotype in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881525,Disease markers,2019 03 29,"Accumulating evidence suggests that pseudogenes play potential roles in the regulation of their cognate wild-type genes, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes.

COL4A3 encodes the α3 chain of type IV collagen, which is the main structural protein in the basement membrane. Mutations in this gene are always related to kidney performance, and deafness and ocular lesion have also been reported. In this study, using next-generation sequencing, we investigated the DNA of a family visiting a clinic for hearing loss. A new missense mutation was found in COL4A3 of 5 patients, c.3227C>T (p.P1076L). Based on these results, we predict that the mutation is pathogenic and leads to abnormal collagen IV. Here, we report for the first time on this autosomal dominant syndrome, characterized by hearing loss and eye abnormalities, but without renal damage, in all carriers. Since the oldest patient in the trial was less than 50 years old, however, we recommend that renal examination be reviewed regularly. Our results reveal expansion in the mutation spectrum of the COL4A3 gene and phenotypic spectrum of collagen IV disease. Our study suggests that next-generation sequencing is an economical and effective method and may help in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of these patients.",Metformin Use and Lung Cancer Risk in Diabetic Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881522,Disease markers,2019 03 29,"Antidiabetic medications (ADMs) can alter the risk of different types of cancer, but the relationship between lung cancer incidence and metformin remains controversial.

We have developed a novel method to evaluate the metabolic defects in peripheral blood mononuclear cells loaded with deuterium-labeled fatty acids directly using the ratios of acylcarnitines determined by flow injection MS/MS. We have identified diagnostic indices for the disorders as follows: decreased ratios of d27-C14-acylcarnitine/d31-C16-acylcarnitine and d23-C12-acylcarnitine/d31-C16-acylcarnitine for carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II (CPT-II) deficiency, decreased ratios of d23-C12-acylcarnitine/d27-C14-acylcarnitine for very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, and increased ratios of d29-C16-OH-acylcarnitine/d31-C16-acylcarnitine for trifunctional protein (TFP) deficiency, together with increased ratios of d7-C4-acylcarnitine/d31-C16-acylcarnitine for carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I deficiency. The decreased ratios of d1-acetylcarnitine/d31-C16-acylcarnitine could be indicative of β-oxidation ability in patients with CPT-II, VLCAD, and TFP deficiencies. Overall, our data showed that the present method was valuable for establishing a rapid diagnosis of fatty acid oxidation disorders and carnitine cycle disorders and for complementing gene analysis because our diagnostic indices may overcome the weaknesses of conventional enzyme activity measurements using fibroblasts or mononuclear cells with assumedly uncertain viability."

Expression of CYP3A5, which is involved in the degradation of irinotecan, has also been reported in colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of the present study was to analyze CYP3A5 expression in the normal colon, colon adenoma, CRC and normal tissues, as well as to examine whether CYP3A5 expression in CRC has an impact on tumor response to irinotecan treatment. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess 85 tissue samples from 65 patients with CRC, along with 15 samples of normal colon and 45 samples of colon adenoma (including tubular, tubulovillous, and sessile serrated adenomas), and a tissue microarray (TMA) comprised of 26 different normal tissue types. Expression of CYP3A5 was evaluated with a semi-quantitative score. Tumor response to irinotecan therapy was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines. In normal tissues, CYP3A5 was expressed in epithelial cells of the colon, gallbladder, kidney, liver, small intestine, stomach, thyroid gland and tonsil, as well as in nerves. Expression in colon mucosa was heterogeneous, with only weak staining in the minority of specimens. CYP3A5 exhibited markedly higher expression in adenomas compared with normal colon tissues. A statistically significant inverse correlation was identified between CYP3A5 expression in CRC tissues and tumor response to irinotecan therapy. Irinotecan treatment itself did not alter CYP3A5 expression in CRC tissues. As CYP3A5 is involved in the degradation of irinotecan, the significantly higher intratumoral expression of CYP3A5 in patients with CRC who do not respond to irinotecan-based chemotherapy may indicate a causal role of CYP3A5 in tumor resistance.",The long non-coding RNA LINC00460 predicts the prognosis and promotes the proliferation and migration of cells in bladder urothelial carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881506,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may serve an important role in cancer development and may also be suitable for use as prognostic biomarkers. At present, the role of lncRNAs in bladder cancer remains unclear. The present study examined the potential involvement of lncRNA LINC00460 in bladder urothelial carcinoma using data from The Caner Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cell line experiments. The results indicated that LINC00460 expression levels were increased in bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues and bladder cancer 5637 and T24 cell lines compared with corresponding normal controls (P<0.05). TCGA data indicated that LINC00460 expression was negatively correlated with a positive prognosis in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma (P<0.05). Consistently, the downregulation of LINC00460 with short hairpin RNA significantly suppressed 5637 and T24 cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, it was suggested that strategies that target LINC00460 may be developed as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of bladder cancer. In addition, the expression level of androgen receptor (AR) was downregulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues and exhibited a negative correlation with the expression level of LINC00460 (r=-0.43; P<0.0001), based on the data from TCGA. We hypothesized that LINC00460 may serve an oncogenic role by regulating the expression of AR.",Small bowel perforation with multiple intestinal metastases from lung carcinoma: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881505,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The present report describes the case of an 81-year-old woman who underwent an emergency explorative laparotomy due to small bowel perforation. Diffuse feculent peritonitis due to perforation of the jejunum was identified. In addition, six distinct tumors of the jejunum in close proximity to the perforation site, as well as two more lesions caudally at the ileum, were identified. A separate stenotic tumor was identified at the sigmoid colon, causing moderate dilatation of the whole intestine. An enterectomy, including the perforation site and the proximal six tumors, was performed, followed by limited enterectomies for the distal two tumors and side-to-side anastomoses of the small intestine. All resected tumors were identified at histology as metastatic from lung carcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient remained in a severe septic condition and succumbed the following day. Metastatic lesions from lung carcinoma in the small bowel wall are a rare finding predisposing to bowel perforation. When an acute condition coexists with multiple intestinal metastases, the mortality rate is high despite prompt surgical intervention.",miR-140-3p inhibits breast cancer proliferation and migration by directly regulating the expression of tripartite motif 28.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881504,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The present study aimed to determine the expression profile and significance of microRNA-140-3p (miR-140-3p) in breast cancer (BC). miR-140-3p expression in BC tumor tissues and cell lines was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Luciferase activity reporter assay and western blotting were used to assess the effect of miR-140-3p expression on tripartite motif 28 (TRIM28). Cell growth, migration, and invasion were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, wound-healing assay and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. miR-140-3p expression was significantly reduced in BC tumor tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues. Additionally, low miR-140-3p expression was found to predict poor prognosis of patients with BC. TRIM28 expression was significantly reduced by miR-140-3p overexpression in BC cell lines, and was inversely correlated with miR-140-3p in BC tissues. Overexpression of miR-140-3p also inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared with in the control group. In conclusion, the present study revealed that miR-140-3p inhibited the progression of BC partially by regulating TRIM28.",p53 overexpression is a prognosticator of poor outcome in esophageal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881503,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Immunohistochemistry studies on p53 inactivation in esophageal cancer are available with inconclusive results. Data on the combined effect of p53 protein accumulation and TP53 genomic deactivation in large scale studies for esophageal cancer are currently lacking. A tissue microarray with 691 esophageal cancer samples was analyzed by p53 immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Nuclear p53 accumulation was observed in 45.9% of patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) and in 40.0% in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Heterozygous TP53 deletions occurred in 40.9% in AC and in 19.4% in SCC. Homozygous deletions did not occur at all. High-level p53 immunostaining was associated with shortened overall survival in AC and SCC while TP53 deletions alone showed no correlation with survival. High-level p53 immunostaining in patients with AC was associated with advanced tumor (P=0.019) and Union for International Cancer Control stages (P=0.004), grading (P=0.027) and the resection margin status (P=0.006). Associations between p53 immunostaining and SCC were not found. TP53 deletions were found to be associated with advanced tumor stages (P=0.028) and the presence of lymph node metastasis (P=0.009) in SCC. In conclusion, strong p53 immunostaining, but not TP53 deletion alone, is associated with unfavorable outcomes and may therefore represent a clinically useful molecular marker in esophageal cancer.",Isolation of circulating tumor cells in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer and a specific confirmation method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881502,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The clinical significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who have undergone radical surgery was investigated. A novel confirmation method for identifying CTCs or circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) in ESCC was also investigated. Blood samples from 55 patients with ESCC were collected 1-3 days prior to surgery and 7 days post-surgery. All patients underwent curative thoracic esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy. Blood samples from 20 healthy volunteers were obtained as controls. Isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells (ISET) was performed also. The overall CTC detection rate was 52.7% preoperatively and 49.1% postoperatively. The presence of CTCs correlated with the Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage and the Log odds of positive lymph nodes. No significant difference in perioperative CTC transformation was discovered between the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic approach, and the open approach. The P40+/cluster of differentiation (CD)45- phenotype was confirmed in the CTCs and CTM. ISET appeared to have high sensitivity for detecting CTCs within ESCC patients. Immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and P40 was a specific, accurate and convenient method for confirming the presence of CTCs or CTM in patients with ESCC, and is strongly recommended as a supplement to morphological analysis.",Determination of the complexity and diversity of the TCR β-chain CDR3 repertoire in bladder cancer using high-throughput sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881501,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The present study aimed to investigate the complexity and diversity of the T lymphocyte immune repertoire in patients with bladder cancer.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Illumina high-throughput sequencing were used to determine the characteristics and clonal diversity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) β-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) gene in the cancerous and paracancerous tissues of patients with bladder cancer. The degree of clonal expansion in malignant samples was significantly higher than in adjacent samples. Furthermore, ΤCRβ variable (TRBV), ΤCRβ diversity (TRBD) and ΤCRβ joining (TRBJ) repertoires were significantly different in cancerous samples compared with adjacent samples. In addition, 13 identified V-J pairs were highly expressed in cancerous samples whereas they had low expression in control samples. In conclusion, the degree of T-cell clonal expansion in bladder cancerous tissue was higher than in paracancerous tissue, whereas the immune diversity of the tissues of patients with bladder cancer was significantly lower. The DNA sequence and amino acid sequences, and V-J combination level may be used to comprehensively understand the diversity and characteristics of TCR CDR3 in bladder cancer and paracancerous tissues, and to evaluate the immune status of bladder cancer to develop therapeutic targets and biomarkers for prognosis monitoring.",Isolation of circulating tumor cells and detection of EGFR mutations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881500,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The aim of the present study was to develop a procedure for the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and to evaluate its application in the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, and potential heterogeneity in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Peripheral blood samples were collected from 91 patients with lung cancer, 10 patients with benign disease and 10 healthy volunteers. CTCs were enriched by positive immunomagnetic separation, detected by immunocytochemistry, and processed for single-cell capture. Pure CTC DNA was amplified, and the EGFR gene was analyzed using the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR). The CTC capture rate in patients with lung cancer was 61.5% (56/91), whereas no CTCs were detected in patients with benign lung disease or in healthy volunteers. The CTC-positive detection rates were 69.3% (52/75) and 25.0% (4/16) in patients with TNM stage III and IV disease, respectively. Markedly more CTCs were captured from patients with small-cell lung cancer compared with patients with other types of cancer. In patients who were positive for EGFR mutations, the detection rate of these mutations was low (16.67%, 2/12), at the single CTC level. The sensitivity increased as the number of CTCs per sample increased. A total of four patients displayed consistent detection of EGFR mutations at the 10-cell level, and one patient exhibited a clear, inconsistent and rare mutation (G719×) between CTCs. A simplified technique for isolating CTCs from blood was established, though multiple CTCs were required to sensitively detect mutations in these cells. The detection of EGFR mutations in CTCs and tissue specimens was generally homogeneous, and therefore, the CTC-level mutation analysis may potentially contribute to the discovery of heterogeneous mutations.",miR-944 inhibits lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis by targeting STAT1 interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881499,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortalities, particularly in developed countries. The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been proven to regulate numerous diseases in the past two decades. miRNAs have been identified in almost all human cancer types. In the present study, the role of miR-944 in LAC proliferation was examined. It was identified that miR-944 was downregulated in LAC tissues and cells, and miR-944 overexpression inhibited A549 and H1299 cell proliferation, as determined by the Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assay. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) was upregulated in LAC tissues and cells. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the 5-year overall survival in patients with high STAT1 levels was significantly reduced, compared with patients with negative and low STAT1 expression. STAT1 was the direct target of miR-944. Additionally, a miR-944 mimic inhibited A549 cell growth in vitro. Collectively, these data demonstrate that miR-944 serves a pivotal role in LAC tumor growth by targeting STAT1. The data obtained indicated that miR-944 may be a novel biomarker and could result in potential therapies for LAC.",Resveratrol induces p53 in colorectal cancer through SET7/9.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881498,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Resveratrol is one of the most promising phytoalexins for use as an anti-cancer agent, which is present in the skin of red grapes and berries. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to modulate a number of signalling pathways that are involved in carcinogenesis. In the present study, the function of resveratrol as a pro-apoptotic agent in colorectal cancer cell lines, including HCT116, CO115 and SW48, was investigated. The results revealed that resveratrol supressed cell viability. Additionally, resveratrol enhanced the expression of tumour protein p53 (p53) and p53 target genes, including Bcl2 associated X, apoptosis regulator and Bcl2 binding component 3 that have a pivotal role in p53-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, treating cells with resveratrol upregulated SET domain containing lysine methyltransferase 7/9 (SET7/9) expression, which positively regulates p53 through its mono-methylation at lysine 372, compared with untreated cells. Furthermore, treating cells with resveratrol induced the expression of apoptotic markers including cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) compared with untreated cells. However, the genetic knockdown of SET7/9 by short hairpin RNA attenuated the resveratrol-driven overexpression of p53, cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Collectively, these results reveal the molecular mechanisms by which resveratrol induces p53 stability in colon cancer that results in the activation of p53-mediated apoptosis."

The progression of gastrointestinal malignancy is regulated by a variety of aberrantly expressed proteins, a number of which facilitate tumor progression, whereas, others function as tumor suppressors. The detection of such proteins not only contributes to the early diagnosis of cancer, they may additionally serve as potential therapeutic targets. In normal tissues, numerous proteins encoded by proto-oncoproteins are degraded by ubiquitylation enzymes, consisting of F-box/WD-40 repeat-containing protein 7 (Fbw7) and other proteins, thus avoiding tumorigenesis and maintaining homeostasis. In tumor tissues, the downregulation of Fbw7, caused by various factors, leads to disorders in ubiquitinase synthesis, which may induce tumor progression and chemoresistance, particularly in gastrointestinal malignancy. Therefore, an in-depth study of the regulatory mechanisms involved in disorders of Fbw7 expression and the role of Fbw7 in chemoresistance of gastrointestinal tumors may suggest improvements for early diagnostic screening and targeted therapy.",Characterizing diversity of food systems in view of sustainability transitions. A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881486,Agronomy for sustainable development,2019 03 29,"Dominant food systems are configured from the productivist paradigm, which focuses on producing large amounts of inexpensive and standardized foods. Although these food systems continue being supported worldwide, they are no longer considered fit-for-purpose as they have been proven unsustainable in environmental and social terms. A large body of scientific literature argues that a transition from the dominant food systems to alternative ones built around the wider principles of sustainable production and rural development is needed. Promoting such a sustainability transition would benefit from a diagnosis of food system types to identify those systems that may harbor promising characteristics for a transition to sustainable food systems. While research on food system transitions abounds, an operational approach to characterize the diversity of food systems taking a system perspective is still lacking. In this paper we review the literature on how transitions to sustainable food systems may play out and present a framework based on the Multi-Level Perspective on Socio-Technical Transitions, which builds upon conceptual developments from social and natural science disciplines. The objectives of the framework are to (i) characterize the diversity of existing food systems at a certain geographical scale based on a set of structural characteristics and (ii) classify the food systems in terms of their support by mainstream practices, i.e., dominant food systems connected to regimes; deviate radically from them, niche food systems such as those based on grassroots innovation; or share elements of dominant and niche food systems, i.e., hybrid food systems. An example is given of application of our framework to vegetable food systems with a focus on production, distribution, and consumption of low-or-no pesticide vegetables in Chile. Drawing on this illustrative example we reflect on usefulness, shortcomings, and further development and use of the diagnostic framework.",Carbon dynamics and GHG implications of increasing wood construction: long-term scenarios for residential buildings in Austria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881485,Carbon management,2019 03 29,"Wooden construction elements often exhibit lower life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than conventional counterparts ('material substitution effect'). Moreover, the building stock represents a carbon (C) sink if timber inflows (construction) surpass outflows (demolition) ('C-stock effect'). A dynamic stock model incorporating these effects is applied to quantify potential climate benefits of wood construction in Austria's residential building sector. If present trends are maintained, culminating in a wood construction share (WCS) of 50% during 2050-2100, building shells could contain three times as much C in 2100 as today. Annual timber demand for residential construction could double, but would remain well below Austria's current net exports. Compared to a baseline scenario with constant WCS (22%), cumulated GHG savings from material substitution until 2050 are estimated 2 to 4.2 Tg CO2-equivalent - clearly less than savings from C-stock expansion (9.2 Tg). Savings from both effects would double in a highly ambitious scenario (WCS=80% during 2050-2100). The applied 'Stock Change Approach' is consistent with IPCC Guidelines, but the above-mentioned savings from C-stock changes would not materialize under the current default GHG inventory accounting approach. Moreover, savings from C-stock effects must eventually be weighed against forest C-stock changes, as growing domestic demand might stimulate wood harvesting.",A Comparative Analysis of Standardised Threads for Use in Implants for Direct Skeletal Attachment of Limb Prosthesis: A Finite Element Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881483,Applied bionics and biomechanics,2019 03 29,"The aim of the research was to determine the optimal thread's shape to be used in implants for direct skeletal attachment of limb prosthesis. In addition, by testing appropriate parameters' modification of the suitable thread, an attempt was made to maximise its effectiveness. The analyses included three thread types described in the ISO standards: shallow, symmetrical, and asymmetrical. The obtained results suggest that shallow thread ensures the lowest equivalent and directional stress peaks generated in the bone as well as favourable stress patterns and profiles during implant loading in relation to symmetrical and asymmetrical threads. Moreover, shallow thread ensured the generation of single equivalent and directional stress peaks, while symmetrical and asymmetrical threads provided additional stress peak for equivalent as well as for each of directional peaks. Subsequently, optimisation of the shallow thread's shape was conducted by changing two relevant thread's parameters (flank angle and rounding arc) which influence the generated stress distribution. The highest reduction of stress peaks was obtained while reducing the rounding arc by 0.2 mm. Therefore, it can be stated that the proposed modification of the HA thread can lead to obtaining a higher biomechanical effectiveness of implants for direct skeletal attachment of limb prosthesis.",Spatiotemporal Distributions and Dynamics of Human Infections with the A H7N9 Avian Influenza Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881481,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2019 03 29,"In 2013 in mainland China, a novel avian influenza virus H7N9 began to infect humans and had aroused severe fatality in the infected humans, followed by the annual outbreaks. By methods of GIS and kriging interpolation, we get the geographical distributions. We obtain the longitudinal characteristics of these outbreaks based on statistics and diagrams. After these spatiotemporal distributions, an eco-epidemiological model is established and analyzed. In this model, the general incidence functions, the factor of fully killed infected poultry, and the virus in environment are taken into account. Theoretical analysis shows that the endemic will be formed to a large extent once the H7N9 avian influenza virus exists in poultry. On the basis of dynamics, we explore the possible disease control measures by numerical simulations. Simulations indicate that measures of vaccination in poultry and stopping live poultry transactions are the primary choices for disease control in humans, and strengthened inhibition effects and environmental disinfections can effectively control the outbreak.",The Effect of CT Scan Parameters on the Measurement of CT Radiomic Features: A Lung Nodule Phantom Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881480,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2019 03 29,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of CT slice thickness, reconstruction algorithm, and radiation dose on quantification of CT features to characterize lung nodules using a chest phantom. Spherical lung nodule phantoms of known densities (-630 and + 100 HU) were inserted into an anthropomorphic thorax phantom. CT scan was performed ten times with relocations. CT data were reconstructed using 12 different imaging settings; three different slice thicknesses of 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mm, two reconstruction kernels of sharp and standard, and two radiation dose of 30 mAs and 12 mAs. Lesions were segmented using a semiautomated method. Twenty representative CT quantitative features representing CT density and texture were compared using multiple regression analysis. In 100 HU nodule phantoms, 18 and 19 among 20 computer features showed significant difference between different mAs and reconstruction algorithms, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). 20, 19, and 19 computer features showed difference between slice thickness of 5.0 vs 1.25, 5.0 vs 2.5, and 2.5 vs 1.25 mm, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). In -630 HU nodule phantoms, 18 and 19 showed significant difference between different mAs and reconstruction algorithms, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). 18, 11, and 17 computer features showed difference between slice thickness of 5.0 vs 1.25, 5.0 vs 2.5, and 2.5 vs 1.25 mm, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). When comparing the absolute value of regression coefficient, the effect of slice thickness in 100 HU nodule and reconstruction algorithm in -630 HU nodule was greater than the effect of remaining scan parameters. The slice thickness, mAs, and reconstruction algorithm had a significant impact on the quantitative image features. In clinical studies involving deep learning or radiomics, it should be noted that differences in values can occur when using computer features obtained from different CT scan parameters in combination. Therefore, when interpreting the statistical analysis results, it is necessary to reflect the difference in the computer features depending on the scan parameters.",State-Dependent Pulse Vaccination and Therapeutic Strategy in an SI Epidemic Model with Nonlinear Incidence Rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881479,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2019 03 29,"In this paper, the state-dependent pulse vaccination and therapeutic strategy are considered in the control of the disease. A pulse system is built to model this process based on an SI ordinary differential equation model. At first, for the system neglecting the impulse effect, we give the classification of singular points. Then for the pulse system, by using the theory of the semicontinuous dynamic system, the dynamics is analyzed. Our analysis shows that the pulse system exhibits rich dynamics and the system has a unique order-1 homoclinic cycle, and by choosing p as the control parameter, the order-1 homoclinic cycle disappears and bifurcates an orbitally asymptotical stable order-1 periodic solution when p changes. Numerical simulations by maple 18 are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results.",Entropic effects in cell lineage tree packings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881478,Nature physics,2019 03 29,"Optimal packings [1, 2] of unconnected objects have been studied for centuries [3-6], but the packing principles of linked objects, such as topologically complex polymers [7, 8] or cell lineages [9, 10], are yet to be fully explored. Here, we identify and investigate a generic class of geometrically frustrated tree packing problems, arising during the initial stages of animal development when interconnected cells assemble within a convex enclosure [10]. Using a combination of 3D imaging, computational image analysis, and mathematical modelling, we study the tree packing problem in Drosophila egg chambers, where 16 germline cells are linked by cytoplasmic bridges to form a branched tree. Our imaging data reveal non-uniformly distributed tree packings, in agreement with predictions from energy-based computations. This departure from uniformity is entropic and affects cell organization during the first stages of the animal's development. Considering mathematical models of increasing complexity, we investigate spherically confined tree packing problems on convex polyhedrons [11] that generalize Platonic and Archimedean solids. Our experimental and theoretical results provide a basis for understanding the principles that govern positional ordering in linked multicellular structures, with implications for tissue organization and dynamics [12, 13].",Extract of Rhus verniciflua Stokes Induces p53-Mediated Apoptosis in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881477,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,"Rhus verniciflua Stokes has long been used as a food supplement and traditional herbal medicine for various ailments in East Asia. We evaluated the anticancer effects of Rhus verniciflua Stokes extract (RVSE) on MCF-7 cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, annexin V/7-AAD staining, and western blotting. In addition, the gallic acid content of RVSE was assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RVSE inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis in the sub-G1 phase. RVSE also significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells and increased the expression of p53 and p21 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, RVSE treatment increased the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and the levels of apoptosis-related factors, such as cleaved caspase-3 and -9 and PARP, in MCF-7 cells. Our findings suggest that the proapoptotic effect of RVSE on MCF-7 cells is mediated by p53, p21, and the intrinsic mitochondrial cascade. Thus, RVSE shows promise for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",Spinal Cord Glycine Transporter 2 Mediates Bilateral ST35 Acupoints Sensitization in Rats with Knee Osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881475,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 06 10,"The concept of ""acupoint sensitization"" refers to the functional status of acupoint switches from silent to active under pathological conditions. In clinic, acupoint sensitization provides important guidance for acupoints selection in different diseases. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. We generated a model of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the left knee of rats. The paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and the total number of mast cells as well as mast cell degranulation rate (MCDR) of acupoint tissue were used to test whether the acupoints were sensitized. The results showed that KOA resulted in a reduced mechanical threshold and elevated total number of mast cell as well as mast cell degranulation rate at bilateral ST35 (Dubi) but not GB37 (Guangming) or nonacupoint area. The acupoint sensitization was accompanied by upregulation of glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) and reduction of extracellular glycine levels in the bilateral dorsal horns of the spinal cord at L3-5. Selective inhibition of GlyT2 or intrathecal administration of glycine attenuated ST35 acupoint sensitization. The sensitization of bilateral ST35 was blocked after intraspinal GlyT2 short hairpin (sh) RNA (GlyT2-shRNA) microinjection to specifically downregulate GlyT2 expression in the left side (ipsilateral) L3-5 spinal cord dorsal horn before MIA injection. Moreover, electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at ST35 ameliorated articular pathological lesions and improved KOA-related pain behaviors. GlyT2-shRNA injection reversed EA-induced pain relief but not EA-induced reduction of joint lesions. Overall, this study demonstrated that spinal GlyT2, especially elevated GlyT2 expression in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord, is a crucial mediator of ST35 acupoint sensitization in KOA rats."

To overcome mentioned dilemmas, a simulation of the articular cartilage microenvironment was constructed by primary articular cartilage cells (pACs) and acellular cartilage extracellular matrix- (ACECM-) oriented scaffold cocultured with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) in vitro. The coculture groups showed more affluent cartilage special matrix ingredients including collagen II and aggrecan based on the results of histological staining and western blotting and cut down as many pACs as possible. The RT-PCR and cell viability experiments also demonstrated that hWJMSCs were successfully induced to differentiate into chondrocytes when cultured in the simulated cartilage microenvironment, as confirmed by the significant upregulation of collagen II and aggrecan, while the cell proliferation activity of pACs was significantly improved by cell-cell interactions. Therefore, compared with monoculture and chondrogenic induction of inducers, coculture providing a simulated native articular microenvironment was a potential and temperate way to regulate the biological behaviors of pACs and hWJMSCs to regenerate the hyaline articular cartilage.",Mitochondrial Role in Stemness and Differentiation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881461,Stem cells international,2019 03 29,"Quiescent and self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on glycolysis rather than on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) for energy production. HSC reliance on glycolysis is considered an adaptation to the hypoxic environment of the bone marrow (BM) and reflects the low energetic demands of HSCs. Metabolic rewiring from glycolysis to mitochondrial-based energy generation accompanies HSC differentiation and lineage commitment. Recent evidence, however, highlights that alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and activity are not simply passive consequences but active drivers of HSC fate decisions. Modulation of mitochondrial activity and metabolism is therefore critical for maintaining the self-renewal potential of primitive HSCs and might be beneficial for ex vivo expansion of transplantable HSCs. In this review, we emphasize recent advances in the emerging role of mitochondria in hematopoiesis, cellular reprograming, and HSC fate decisions.","Our Experience with Iatrogenic Ureteric Injuries among Women Presenting to University College Hospital, Ibadan: A Call to Action on Trigger Factors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881457,Obstetrics and gynecology international,2019 03 29,"Ureteric injuries leading to ureterovaginal fistula (UVF) is less common than vesicovaginal fistula, as a cause of urinary incontinence.

Catheterization in medicine is a source of highly resistant bacterial infections, and those bacteria respond poorly to antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial biofilm features were not described from catheterized inpatients in Ethiopia as its formation is known to afford antimicrobial resistance and challenge patient management. The aim of this study was to isolate catheter-associated urinary bacterial pathogens, their biofilm formation, and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern among inpatients of Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC) in Southwest Ethiopia. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among urinary catheterized inpatients of JUMC from February to August 2016. A total of 143 study participants were enrolled consecutively in this study. Urine samples were collected from catheterized patients and processed using a standard bacteriological protocol for isolation and identification. Evaluation of in vitro biofilm formation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of uropathogenic bacteria was done using microtiter plates and disk diffusion method, respectively. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into SPSS version 20 for analysis. All statistical test values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. From all study participants, mean age was 44 years. Sixty bacterial strains were recovered from 57 urinary catheterized inpatients among which 54 of them were monomicrobial (94.7%). The remaining six bacterial strains were recovered from three study participants each with two bacterial isolates. The predominant bacterial isolates were Gram-negative bacteria with E. coli turning out first. About 80% of bacterial isolates were biofilm formers. The majority of the bacteria were resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents. In conclusion, the majority of bacterial uropathogen isolates were Gram-negative, biofilm formers, and resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents.

We aimed to examine the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of phenylurea herbicides (phenuron, monuron, and diuron) on the oxytocin (OT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) release of neurohypophysis cell cultures (NH). In our experiments, monoamine-activated receptor functions of neurohypophyseal cells were used as a model. In vitro NH were prepared by enzymatic (trypsin, collagenase) and mechanical dissociation. In the experimental protocol, the basal levels of OT and AVP were determined as controls. Later, monoamine (epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, and dopamine) activation (10-6 M, 30 min) and the effects of phenylurea (10-6 M, 60 min) alone and in combination (monoamines 10-6 M, 30 min + phenylureas 10-6 M, 60 min) with monoamine were studied. OT and AVP hormone contents in the supernatant media were measured by radioimmunoassay. The monoamine-activated receptor functions of neurohypophyseal cells were modified by the applied doses of phenuron, monuron, and diuron. It is concluded that the applied phenylurea herbicides are endocrine disruptor agents, at least in vitro for neurohypophysis function.",Analysis of In Vitro Osteoblast Culture on Scaffolds for Future Bone Regeneration Purposes in Dentistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881450,Advances in pharmacological sciences,2019 03 29,"One of the main focuses of tissue engineering is to search for tridimensional scaffold materials, complying with nature's properties for tissue regeneration. Determining material biocompatibility is a fundamental step in considering its use. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze osteoblast cell adhesion and viability on different materials to determine which was more compatible for future bone regeneration. Tridimensional structures were fabricated with hydroxyapatite, collagen, and porous silica. The bovine bone was used as material control. Biocompatibility was determined by seeding primary osteoblasts on each tridimensional structure. Cellular morphology was assessed by SEM and viability through confocal microscopy. Osteoblast colonization was observed on all evaluated materials' surface, revealing they did not elicit osteoblast cytotoxicity. Analyses of four different materials studied with diverse compositions and characteristics showed that adhesiveness was best seen for HA and viability for collagen. In general, the results of this investigation suggest these materials can be used in combination, as scaffolds intended for bone regeneration in dental and medical fields."

Although not fully understood, proplatelets transform into platelets in the lung. The body tries to maintain platelet count relatively constant throughout life. Pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia can be defined by hemodilution, elevated levels of platelet consumption, compromise of platelet production, increased platelet sequestration and increased platelet destruction. Unlike in other situations, absolute platelet count alone does not provide sufficient data in characterizing thrombocytopenia in ICU patients. In such cases, the time course of changes in platelet count is also pivotal. The dynamics of platelet count decrease vary considerably between different ICU patient populations including trauma, major surgery and minor surgery/medical conditions.

In this review we outline the basic mechanisms and signaling pathways conserved between humans and flies responsible of inducing uncontrolled growth and cancer development. Second, we describe classic and novel Drosophila models used to study different cancers, with the objective to discuss their strengths and limitations on their use to identify signals driving growth cell autonomously and within organs, drug discovery and for therapeutic approaches.",Identification of Important Effector Proteins in the FOXJ1 Transcriptional Network Associated With Ciliogenesis and Ciliary Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881373,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 29,"Developmental defects in motile cilia, arising from genetic abnormalities in one or more ciliary genes, can lead to a common ciliopathy known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Functional studies in model organisms undertaken to understand PCD or cilia biogenesis have identified 100s of genes regulated by Foxj1, the master regulator of motile ciliogenesis. However, limited systems based studies have been performed to elucidate proteins or network/s crucial to the motile ciliary interactome, although this approach holds promise for identification of multiple cilia-associated genes, which, in turn, could be utilized for screening and early diagnosis of the disease. Here, based on the assumption that FOXJ1-mediated regulatory and signaling networks are representative of the motile cilia interactome, we have constructed and analyzed the gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) mediated by FOXJ1. The predicted FOXJ1 regulatory network comprises of 424 directly and 148 indirectly regulated genes. Additionally, based on gene ontology analysis, we have associated 17 directly and 6 indirectly regulated genes with possible ciliary roles. Topological and perturbation analyses of the PPIN (6927 proteins, 40,608 interactions) identified 121 proteins expressed in ciliated cells, which interact with multiple proteins encoded by FoxJ1 induced genes (FIG) as important interacting proteins (IIP). However, it is plausible that IIP transcriptionally regulated by FOXJ1 and/or differentially expressed in PCD are likely to have crucial roles in motile cilia. We have found 20 de-regulated topologically important effector proteins in the FOXJ1 regulatory network, among which some (PLSCR1, SSX2IP, ACTN2, CDC42, HSP90AA1, PIAS4) have previously reported ciliary roles. Furthermore, based on pathway enrichment of these proteins and their primary interactors, we have rationalized their possible roles in the ciliary interactome. For instance, 5 among these novel proteins that are involved in cilia associated signaling pathways (like Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Toll-like receptor etc.) could be 'topologically important signaling proteins.' Therefore, based on this FOXJ1 network study we have predicted important effectors in the motile cilia interactome, which are possibly associated with ciliary biology and/or function and are likely to further our understanding of the pathophysiology in ciliopathies like PCD.",The Impact of Heterogeneity on Single-Cell Sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881372,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 29,"The importance of diversity and cellular specialization is clear for many reasons, from population-level diversification, to improved resiliency to unforeseen stresses, to unique functions within metazoan organisms during development and differentiation.

With easy access to single-cell NGS (scNGS), new opportunities exist to examine different levels of gene expression and somatic mutational heterogeneity, but these assays can generate yottabyte scale data. Here, we model the importance of heterogeneity for large-scale analysis of scNGS data, with a focus on the utilization in oncology and other diseases, providing a guide to aid in sample size and experimental design.",Progress and Opportunities in the Characterization of Cellulose - An Important Regulator of Cell Wall Growth and Mechanics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881371,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"The plant cell wall is a dynamic network of several biopolymers and structural proteins including cellulose, pectin, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose is one of the main load bearing components of this complex, heterogeneous structure, and in this way, is an important regulator of cell wall growth and mechanics. Glucan chains of cellulose aggregate via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces to form long thread-like crystalline structures called cellulose microfibrils. The shape, size, and crystallinity of these microfibrils are important structural parameters that influence mechanical properties of the cell wall and these parameters are likely important determinants of cell wall digestibility for biofuel conversion. Cellulose-cellulose and cellulose-matrix interactions also contribute to the regulation of the mechanics and growth of the cell wall. As a consequence, much emphasis has been placed on extracting valuable structural details about cell wall components from several techniques, either individually or in combination, including diffraction/scattering, microscopy, and spectroscopy. In this review, we describe efforts to characterize the organization of cellulose in plant cell walls. X-ray scattering reveals the size and orientation of microfibrils; diffraction reveals unit lattice parameters and crystallinity. The presence of different cell wall components, their physical and chemical states, and their alignment and orientation have been identified by Infrared, Raman, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Sum Frequency Generation spectroscopy. Direct visualization of cell wall components, their network-like structure, and interactions between different components has also been made possible through a host of microscopic imaging techniques including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. This review highlights advantages and limitations of different analytical techniques for characterizing cellulose structure and its interaction with other wall polymers. We also delineate emerging opportunities for future developments of structural characterization tools and multi-modal analyses of cellulose and plant cell walls. Ultimately, elucidation of the structure of plant cell walls across multiple length scales will be imperative for establishing structure-property relationships to link cell wall structure to control of growth and mechanics.",Transient Stability of Epigenetic Population Differentiation in a Clonal Invader.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881370,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"Epigenetic variation may play an important role in how plants cope with novel environments. While significant epigenetic differences among plants from contrasting habitats have often been observed in the field, the stability of these differences remains little understood. Here, we combined field monitoring with a multi-generation common garden approach to study the dynamics of DNA methylation variation in invasive Chinese populations of the clonal alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides). Using AFLP and MSAP markers, we found little variation in DNA sequence but substantial epigenetic population differentiation. In the field, these differences remained stable across multiple years, whereas in a common environment they were maintained at first but then progressively eroded. However, some epigenetic differentiation remained even after 10 asexual generations. Our data indicate that epigenetic variation in alligator weed most likely results from a combination of environmental induction and spontaneous epimutation, and that much of it is neither rapidly reversible (phenotypic plasticity) nor long-term stable, but instead displays an intermediate level of stability. Such transient epigenetic stability could be a beneficial mechanism in novel and heterogeneous environments, particularly in a genetically impoverished invader.",A Role for Epigenetic Regulation in the Adaptation and Stress Responses of Non-model Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881369,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"In recent years enormous progress has been made in understanding the role of epigenetic regulation response to environmental stimuli, especially in response to stresses. Molecular mechanisms involved in chromatin dynamics and silencing have been explained, leading to an appreciation of how new phenotypes can be generated quickly in response to environmental modifications. In some cases, it has also been shown that epigenetic modifications can be stably transmitted to the next generations. Despite this, the vast majority of studies have been carried out with model plants, particularly with Arabidopsis, and very little is known on how native plants in their natural habitat react to changes in their environment. Climate change has been affecting, sometimes drastically, the conditions of numerous ecosystems around the world, forcing populations of native species to adapt quickly. Although part of the adaptation can be explained by the preexisting genetic variation in the populations, recent studies have shown that new stable phenotypes can be generated through epigenetic modifications in few generations, contributing to the stability and survival of the plants in their natural habitat. Here, we review the recent data that suggest that epigenetic variation can help natural populations to cope to with change in their environments.","Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation of Tree Fruit Crops: Methods, Progress, and Challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881368,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"Genetic engineering based on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been a desirable tool to manipulate single or multiple genes of existing genotypes of woody fruit crops, for which conventional breeding is a difficult and lengthy process due to heterozygosity, sexual incompatibility, juvenility, or a lack of natural sources. To date, successful transformation has been reported for many fruit crops. We review the major progress in genetic transformation of these fruit crops made in the past 5 years, emphasizing reproducible transformation protocols as well as the strategies that have been tested in fruit crops. While direct transformation of scion cultivars was mostly used for fruit quality improvement, biotic and abiotic tolerance, and functional gene analysis, transgrafting on genetically modified (GM) rootstocks showed a potential to produce non-GM fruit products. More recently, genome editing technology has demonstrated a potential for gene(s) manipulation of several fruit crops. However, substantial efforts are still needed to produce plants from gene-edited cells, for which tremendous challenge remains in the context of either cell's recalcitrance to regeneration or inefficient gene-editing due to their polyploidy. We propose that effective transient transformation and efficient regeneration are the key for future utilization of genome editing technologies for improvement of fruit crops.","Infection Strategies Deployed by Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium acuminatum, and Rhizopus stolonifer as a Function of Tomato Fruit Ripening Stage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881367,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"Worldwide, 20-25% of all harvested fruit and vegetables are lost annually in the field and throughout the postharvest supply chain due to rotting by fungal pathogens. Most postharvest pathogens exhibit necrotrophic or saprotrophic lifestyles, resulting in decomposition of the host tissues and loss of marketable commodities. Necrotrophic fungi can readily infect ripe fruit leading to the rapid establishment of disease symptoms. However, these pathogens generally fail to infect unripe fruit or remain quiescent until host conditions stimulate a successful infection. Previous research on infections of fruit has mainly been focused on the host's genetic and physicochemical factors that inhibit or promote disease. Here, we investigated if fruit pathogens can modify their own infection strategies in response to the ripening stage of the host. To test this hypothesis, we profiled global gene expression of three fungal pathogens that display necrotrophic behavior-Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium acuminatum, and Rhizopus stolonifer-during interactions with unripe and ripe tomato fruit. We assembled and functionally annotated the transcriptomes of F. acuminatum and R. stolonifer as no genomic resources were available. Then, we conducted differential gene expression analysis to compare each pathogen during inoculations versus in vitro conditions. Through characterizing patterns of overrepresented pathogenicity and virulence functions (e.g., phytotoxin production, cell wall degradation, and proteolysis) among the differentially expressed genes, we were able to determine shared strategies among the three fungi during infections of compatible (ripe) and incompatible (unripe) fruit tissues. Though each pathogen's strategy differed in the details, interactions with unripe fruit were commonly characterized by an emphasis on the degradation of cell wall components, particularly pectin, while colonization of ripe fruit featured more heavily redox processes, proteolysis, metabolism of simple sugars, and chitin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we determined that the three fungi were unable to infect fruit from the non-ripening (nor) tomato mutant, confirming that to cause disease, these pathogens require the host tissues to undergo specific ripening processes. By enabling a better understanding of fungal necrotrophic infection strategies, we move closer to generating accurate models of fruit diseases and the development of early detection tools and effective management strategies.",Potato Virus Y Detection in Seed Potatoes Using Deep Learning on Hyperspectral Images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881366,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"Virus diseases are of high concern in the cultivation of seed potatoes. Once found in the field, virus diseased plants lead to declassification or even rejection of the seed lots resulting in a financial loss. Farmers put in a lot of effort to detect diseased plants and remove virus-diseased plants from the field. Nevertheless, dependent on the cultivar, virus diseased plants can be missed during visual observations in particular in an early stage of cultivation. Therefore, there is a need for fast and objective disease detection. Early detection of diseased plants with modern vision techniques can significantly reduce costs. Laboratory experiments in previous years showed that hyperspectral imaging clearly could distinguish healthy from virus infected potato plants. This paper reports on our first real field experiment. A new imaging setup was designed, consisting of a hyperspectral line-scan camera. Hyperspectral images were taken in the field with a line interval of 5 mm. A fully convolutional neural network was adapted for hyperspectral images and trained on two experimental rows in the field. The trained network was validated on two other rows, with different potato cultivars. For three of the four row/date combinations the precision and recall compared to conventional disease assessment exceeded 0.78 and 0.88, respectively. This proves the suitability of this method for real world disease detection.",Plant Density and Nitrogen Supply Affect the Grain-Filling Parameters of Maize Kernels Located in Different Ear Positions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881365,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 29,"Although yield output of maize (Zea mays L.) has improved markedly over the last century, procedures for improving the grain-filling process remain elusive. Our aim in this study was to relate grain-filling variation in maize (including kernels in apical and middle positions in the ears) to plant density and nitrogen (N) application rate using a crossed experimental design. We also investigated changes in zeatin riboside (ZR), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellic acid (GA) in the kernels during the grain-filling period. Two high-yield maize varieties cultivated extensively in China were field grown under normal (67,500 pl ha-1) and high (97,500 pl ha-1) densities, and supplied with low, normal and high (0, 180, and 360 kg N ha-1) concentrations of N. Kernel weight (KW), the maximum grain-filling rate (Gmax), the average grain-filling rate (Gave), and the kernel weight increment achieving Gmax (Wmax) were all significantly depressed under high density (HD) conditions, but increased N supply partially offset the losses. The apical kernels were more sensitive to density and N application rate than middle kernels. Correlation analysis indicated that plant density and N rate affected KW mainly by influencing the grain-filling rate. Variation in ZR, IAA, and ABA content tracked the variation in KW, but variation in GA content did not. Furthermore, the grain-filling parameters (closely related to TKW) had strong canonical correlation with the content of all hormones across the filling period and ZR content had the strongest relationship. Based on our study, high N supply is beneficial to optimize grain-filling parameters and improve KW of maize kernels under crowded condition."

Broad host range plasmids are known to transfer to diverse bacteria in extracted soil bacterial communities when evaluated by filter mating incubation. However, the persistence and dissemination of broad range plasmid in natural soil has not been well studied. In this study, Pseudomonas putida with a conjugative antibiotic resistance plasmid RP4 was inoculated into a soil microcosm, the fate and persistence of P. putida and RP4 were monitored by quantitative PCR. The concentrations of P. putida and RP4 both rapidly decreased within 15-day incubation. P. putida then decayed at a significantly lower rate during subsequent incubation, however, no further decay of RP4 was observed, resulting in an elevated RP4/P. putida ratio (up to 10) after 75-day incubation, which implied potential transfer of RP4 to soil microbiota. We further sorted RP4 recipient bacteria from the soil microcosms by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Spread of RP4 increased during 75-day microcosm operation and was estimated at around 10-4 transconjugants per recipient at the end of incubation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of transconjugants showed that host bacteria of RP4 were affiliated to more than 15 phyla, with increased diversity and shift in the composition of host bacteria. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the transconjugant pools. Transient transfer of RP4 to some host bacteria was observed. These results emphasize the prolonged persistence of P. putida and RP4 in natural soil microcosms, and highlight the potential risks of increased spread potential of plasmid and broader range of host bacteria in disseminating ARGs in soil.",Effect of Organic Carbon and Nitrogen on the Interactions of Morchella spp. and Bacteria Dispersing on Their Mycelium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881350,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"In this study we investigated how the source of organic carbon (Corg) and nitrogen (Norg) affects the interactions between fungi of the genus Morchella and bacteria dispersing along their hyphae (fungal highways; FH). We demonstrated that bacteria using FH increase the hydrolysis of an organic nitrogen source that only the fungus can degrade. Using purified fungal exudates, we found that this increased hydrolysis was due to bacteria enhancing the activity of proteolytic enzymes produced by the fungus. The same effect was shown for various fungal and bacterial strains. The effect of this enhanced proteolytic activity on bacterial and fungal biomass production varied accordingly to the source of Corg and Norg provided. An increase in biomass for both partners 5 days post-inoculation was only attained with a Norg source that the bacterium could not degrade and when additional Corg was present in the medium. In contrast, all other combinations yielded a decrease on biomass production in the co-cultures compared to individual growth. The coupled cycling of Corg and Norg is rarely considered when investigating the role of microbial activity on soil functioning. Our results show that cycling of these two elements can be related through cross-chemical reactions in independent, albeit interacting microbes. In this way, the composition of organic material could greatly alter nutrient turnover due to its effect on the outcome of interactions between fungi and bacteria that disperse on their mycelia.",Popular Diabetes Apps and the Impact of Diabetes App Use on Self-Care Behaviour: A Survey Among the Digital Community of Persons With Diabetes on Social Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881349,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 05 07,"Introduction: This study aimed to identify popular diabetes applications (apps) and to investigate the association of diabetes app use and other factors with cumulative self-care behaviour. Methods: From November 2017 to March 2018, we conducted a web-based survey with persons 18 years of age and above. We recruited respondents via diabetes Facebook groups, online patient-forums and targeted Facebook advertisements (ads). Data on participants' demographic, clinical, and self-management characteristics, as well as on self-care behaviour and characteristics of the diabetes apps use were collected. Self-care behaviour was measured using a licensed version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities (SDSCA) questionnaire. The cumulative self-care score was calculated by summing up scores for ""general diet,"" ""specific diet,"" ""exercise,"" ""blood glucose testing,"" ""foot care"" and ""smoking."" To identify popular diabetes apps, users were requested to list all apps they use for diabetes self-management. Two sample t-test and multiple linear regression stratified by type of diabetes were performed to examine associations between app use and self-care behaviour, by controlling for key confounders. Results: One thousand fifty two respondents with type 1 and 630 respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) entered the survey. More than half, 549 (52.2%), and one third, 210 (33.3%), of respondents with type 1 and 2 DM, respectively, reported using diabetes apps for self-management. ""mySugr"" and continuous glucose monitoring apps, such as ""Dexcom,"" ""Freestyle Libre,"" and ""Xdrip+"" were some of the most popular diabetes apps. In both respondent groups, the cumulative self-care behaviour score was significantly higher among diabetes app users (compared to non-users) and scores for three individual self-care components, namely ""blood glucose monitoring,"" ""general diet,"" and ""physical activity"" were significantly higher among diabetes app users than among non-users. After adjusting for confounding factors, diabetes app use increased the cumulative self-care score by 1.08 (95%CI: 0.46-1.7) units among persons with type 1 DM and by 1.18 (95%CI: 0.26-2.09) units among persons with type 2 DM, respectively. Conclusion: For both, persons with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, using diabetes apps for self-management was positively associated with self-care behaviour. Our findings suggest that apps can support changes in lifestyle and glucose monitoring in these populations.",The Highly Expressed FAM83F Protein in Papillary Thyroid Cancer Exerts a Pro-Oncogenic Role in Thyroid Follicular Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881348,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer with predominant prevalence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) histotype. MAPK signaling genetic alterations are frequent in PTC, affecting more than 80% of cases. These alterations constitutively activate MAPK signaling cross-regulating different pro-oncogenic pathways. However, additional molecular alterations associated with thyroid cancer are not completely understood. In this extent, the new family of proteins named FAM83 (FAMily with sequence similarity 83) was recently identified as mediator of oncogenic signaling in different types of cancer. Here we report FAM83F as a novel highly expressed protein in PTC. We evaluated FAM83F levels in 106 PTC specimens, 34 goiter, and 41 adjacent non-tumoral human thyroid, and observed FAM83F cytoplasmic overexpression in 71% of PTC (76 of 106) while goiter tissues showed nuclear positivity and normal thyroid showed no staining by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, TSH-induced goiter and BRAFT1799A -induced PTC animal models also showed FAM83F activation. In vitro, we generated a stable thyroid cell line PCCL3 with FAM83F overexpression and observed that FAM83F deregulates thyroid follicular cell biology leading to loss of thyroid differentiation genes such as Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS), reactivation of stem cell markers such as LIN28B and SOX2, induction of cell migration and resistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FAM83F activates MAPK signaling through interaction with BRAF and RAF while impairs TGFβ antiproliferative signaling transduction. In this study, we showed FAM83F as a new pro-oncogenic protein overexpressed in thyroid cancer that modulates thyroid follicular cell biology and differentiation through cross-regulation of MAPK and TGFβ signaling.",A New Model for Evaluation of Interventions to Prevent Obesity in Early Childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881347,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Background: Childhood obesity is a serious public health issue. In Australia, 1 in 4 children is already affected by overweight or obesity at the time of school entry. Governments around the world have recognized this problem through investment in the prevention of pediatric obesity, yet few interventions in early childhood have been subjected to economic evaluation. Information on cost-effectiveness is vital to decisions about program implementation. A challenge in evaluating preventive interventions in early childhood is to capture long-term costs and outcomes beyond the duration of an intervention, as the benefits of early obesity prevention will not be realized until some years into the future. However, decisions need to be made in the present, and modeling is one way to inform such decisions. Objective: To describe the conceptual structure of a new health economic model (the Early Prevention of Obesity in CHildhood (EPOCH) model) for evaluating childhood obesity interventions; and to validate the epidemiologic predictions. Methods and Results: We use an individual-level (micro-simulation) method to model BMI trajectories and the progression of obesity from early childhood to adolescence. The equations predicting individual BMI change underpinning our model were derived from data from the population-representative study, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Our approach is novel because it will account for costs and benefits accrued throughout childhood and adolescence. As a first step to validate the epidemiological predictions of the model, we used input data representing over 250,000 children aged 4/5 years, and simulated BMI and obesity trajectories until adolescence. Simulated mean BMI and obesity prevalence for boys and girls were verified by nationally-representative data on children at 14/15 years of age. Discussion: The EPOCH model is epidemiologically sound in its prediction of both BMI trajectories and prevalence of obesity for boys and girls. Future developments of the model will include socio-economic position and will incorporate the impacts of obesity on healthcare costs. The EPOCH model will help answer: when is it best to intervene in childhood; what are the most cost-effective approaches and which population groups will benefit most from interventions.",Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals: An Occult Mediator of Metabolic Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881345,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), a heterogeneous group of exogenous chemicals that can interfere with any aspect of endogenous hormones, represent an emerging global threat for human metabolism. There is now considerable evidence that the observed upsurge of metabolic disease cannot be fully attributed to increased caloric intake, physical inactivity, sleep deficit, and ageing. Among environmental factors implicated in the global deterioration of metabolic health, EDCs have drawn the biggest attention of scientific community, and not unjustifiably. EDCs unleash a coordinated attack toward multiple components of human metabolism, including crucial, metabolically-active organs such as hypothalamus, adipose tissue, pancreatic beta cells, skeletal muscle, and liver. Specifically, EDCs' impact during critical developmental windows can promote the disruption of individual or multiple systems involved in metabolism, via inducing epigenetic changes that can permanently alter the epigenome in the germline, enabling changes to be transmitted to the subsequent generations. The clear effect of this multifaceted attack is the manifestation of metabolic disease, clinically expressed as obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although limitations of EDCs research do exist, there is no doubt that EDCs constitute a crucial parameter of the global deterioration of metabolic health we currently encounter.",A Sex-Specific Analysis of the Predictive Value of Troponin I and T in Patients With and Without Diabetes Mellitus After Successful Coronary Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881344,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Background: Elevated levels of troponin are associated with future major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Data on the prognostic value of high sensitive troponin T (hs-TnT) compared to high sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI) in diabetic and non-diabetic patients are sparse. Methods: We analyzed patients of a single-center registry undergoing coronary stenting between 2003 and 2006. As a primary endpoint we assessed MACE, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke according to sex and diabetes status using log-rank. As a second endpoint, we assessed the prognostic impact of hs-TnT and hs-TnI on MACE, adjusting for known confounders using Cox regression analysis. Results: Out of 818 investigated patients, 267 (32.6%) were female. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) was diagnosed in 206 (25.2%) patients. After a mean follow-up of 6.6 ± 3.7 years, MACE occurred in 235 (28.7%) patients. The primary endpoint components of cardiovascular death occurred in 115 (14.1%) patients, MI in 75 (9.2%), and ischemic stroke in 45 (5.5%). Outcomes differed significantly according to sex and diabetes status (p = 0.003). In descending order, MACE rates were as follows: female diabetic patients (40.8%), female non-diabetic patients (32.7%), male diabetic patients (28.9%), and male non-diabetic patients (24.8%). Additionally, females with diabetes were at higher risk of cardiovascular death compared to diabetic men (28 vs. 15%). Hs-TnI (HR 1.477 [95% CI 1.100-1.985]; p = 0.010) and hs-TnT (HR 1.615 [95%CI 1.111-2.348]; p = 0.012) above the 99th percentile were significantly associated with MACE. Both assays showed tendency toward association with MACE in all subgroups. Conclusion: Diabetic patients, particularly females, with known coronary artery disease had a higher risk of subsequent MACE. Both, hs-TnI and hs-TnT significantly correlated with MACE.",Vitamin D Insufficiency in Overweight and Obese Children and Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881343,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Excessive body weight and obesity in childhood and adolescence are becoming more and more important unfavorable factors that entail extremely adverse consequences and require close attention of physicians of any specialty. Along with the high prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in pediatric patients, children and adolescents in the majority of countries are diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Among the non-calcaemic effects of vitamin D, a significant role is played by its impact on the hormonal regulation of glucose metabolism and the synthesis of adipokines by fat tissue. The review presents literature data indicative of a close pathogenic relationship between vitamin D insufficiency and impaired tissue insulin sensitivity. It demonstrates the role of vitamin D insufficiency in immune reactions resulting in development of subclinical inflammation in fat tissue infiltrated with macrophages and lymphocytes. It also shows the role of adipokines, immune system cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by them in the pathogenesis of obesity, as well as the function of vitamin D as an endocrine and paracrine regulator of the process of inflammation in adipose tissue. The relationships between the principal adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin) are revealed in the presence of normal vitamin D content and in vitamin D deficiency. The carbohydrate and lipid metabolism parameters in overweight children and adolescents with vitamin D insufficiency are analyzed. A high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in overweight and obese children and adolescents (increasing along with the severity of obesity) is demonstrated. The review also presents the current recommendations for the correction of vitamin D insufficiency and underlines the need for higher cholecalciferol doses to achieve serum calcifediol targets in overweight and obese children and adolescents.",Factors Predicting Time to TSH Normalization and Persistence of TSH Suppression After Total Thyroidectomy for Graves' Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881342,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Hyperthyroidism related to Graves' disease is associated with a suppression of TSH values which may persist after surgery in spite of a LT4 replacement therapy at non-TSH-suppressing doses. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the time to TSH normalization in a group of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease receiving a LT4 therapy dose regimen based on a previously published nomogram, and to identify possible correlations between the time to normalization of post-operative TSH values and preoperative clinical and biochemical parameters. 276 patients affected by Graves' disease who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2015, were retrospectively evaluated for clinical and biochemical parameters as well as post-surgical LT4 treatment regimen. Of the 276 subjects, 174 had initiated LT4 dosage corresponding to a previously published nomogram. 59 patients were excluded because their LT4 requirement (in mcg/kg/day) changed and deviated from the nomogram during the follow-up period, 15 patients were excluded because their TSH level was >4 mcU/ml during the first biochemical evaluation and 2 patients were excluded because they had low TSH levels potentially related to central hypothyroidism due to concomitant hypopituitarism. Therefore, 98 patients were included in our statistical analysis. TSH and FT4 were evaluated at the first post-operative assessment and during follow up until the normalization of TSH values was achieved, and then included in the analysis. During the first post-operative evaluation 2 months after surgery, 59/98 patients had TSH values in the normal range (0.4 to 4.0 mcU/ml), while 39/98 patients had a TSH value < 0.4 mcU/mL. The persistence of post-operative TSH levels < 0.4 mcU/ml was significantly correlated (p = 0.022) with longer duration of the disease. The value of anti-TSH receptor autoantibodies (TrAb) at the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, significantly correlated (p = 0.002) with the time to TSH normalization in the group of patients with TSH < 0.4 mcU/ml at first control. This retrospective analysis confirms that in subjects who have undergone thyroidectomy for Graves' disease, time to normalization of TSH may be prolonged. Hence, the role of TSH as the ""gold standard"" to assess the appropriate LT4 replacement therapy regimen during the initial months following surgery may need to be reconsidered.","Insulin/IGF-1R, SIRT1, and FOXOs Pathways-An Intriguing Interaction Platform for Bone and Osteosarcoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881341,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 03 29,"Aging is a substantial risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis (OA) and, probably, an essential substrate for the development of neoplastic disease of the bone, such as osteosarcoma, which is the most common malignant mesenchymal primary bone tumor. Genetic studies have established that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT (Protein Kinase B) signal transduction pathway is involved across species, including nematodes, fruit flies, and mammals. SIRT1, a phylogenetically-conserved family of deacetylases, seems to play pleiotropic effects in epithelial malignancies of the liver and interact with the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway. Some of the most critical processes in degenerative conditions may indeed include the insulin/IGF1R and SIRT1 signaling pathways as well as some specific transcription factors. The Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (FOXOs) control diverse cellular functions, such as metabolism, longevity, and cell death. FOXOs play a critical role in the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway. FOXOs can indeed be modulated to reduce age-related diseases. FOXOs have advantageous inhibitory effects on fibroblast and myofibroblast activation, which are accompanied by a subsequent excessive production of extracellular matrix. FOXOs can block or decrease the fibrosis levels in numerous organs. Previously, we observed a correlation between nuclear FOXO3 and high caspase-8 expression, which induces cellular apoptosis in response to harmful external stimuli. In this perspective, we emphasize the current advances and interactions involving the insulin/IGF1R, SIRT1, and FOXOs pathways in the bone and osteosarcoma for a better understanding of the mechanisms potentially underpinning tissue degeneration and tumorigenesis."

This study investigated the effect of Dynamic Neuro-Cognitive Imagery (DNITM) training on developpé performance (measured by gesturing ankle height and self-reported observations) and kinematics (measured by hip and pelvic range-of-motion), as well as on dance imagery abilities. Thirty-four university-level dance students (M age = 19.70 ± 1.57) were measured performing three developpé tasks (i.e., 4 repetitions, 8 consecutive seconds hold, and single repetition) at three time-points (2 × pre-, 1 × post-intervention). Data were collected using three-dimensional motion capture, mental imagery questionnaires, and subjective reports. Following the DNITM intervention, significant increases (p < 0.01) were detected in gesturing ankle height, as well as in hip flexion and abduction range-of-motion, without significant changes in pelvic alignment. These gains were accompanied by self-reported decrease (p < 0.05) in level of difficulty experienced and significant improvements in kinesthetic (p < 0.05) and dance (p < 0.01) imagery abilities.

Among the variables that play an important role in school success, parenting styles and behavior problems are some of the most studied. Literature shows that presence of behavioral problem and parenting styles based on physical punishment, lack of consistency and ineffective limit setting are related to poor academic achievement. The present study examined the influence of maternal and paternal parenting styles and behavior problems on the academic outcomes of primary-school children. Measures used in this study included the Inventory of Parenting Guide, the Child Behavior Checklist and information on academic outcomes (n = 78 families). The range age of the students was 6 to 13 years old (mean = 8.08; SD = 1.6; 38 girls). The participation rate was 90.7%. The results showed that behavior problems and sensitive parenting style were related to academic outcomes. Specifically, attentional problems and maternal sensitive parenting styles appeared to be significant predictors of academic outcomes in this study. These data suggest the relevance of attention and maternal sensitive parenting styles in understanding processes that promote academic outcomes.",Understanding Contextual Spillover: Using Identity Process Theory as a Lens for Analyzing Behavioral Responses to a Workplace Dietary Choice Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881326,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"Spillover occurs when one environmentally sustainable behavior leads to another, often initiated by a behavior change intervention. A number of studies have investigated positive and negative spillover effects, but empirical evidence is mixed, showing evidence for both positive and negative spillover effects, and lack of spillover altogether. Environmental identity has been identified as an influential factor for spillover effects. Building on identity process theory the current framework proposes that positive, negative, and a lack of spillover are determined by perceived threat of initial behavior and identity process mechanisms evaluating the behavior. It is proposed, that an environmental behavior change intervention may threaten one's existing identities, leading to either (a) integration, (b) compartmentalization, or (c) conflict between one's environmental identity and non-environmental identities. Initial evidence for the proposed framework is based on a field intervention which included a meat reduction programme in a canteen of a medium size private sector company. Semi-structured interviews and an explorative visualization method that aimed at assessing identity change were implemented with thirteen employees (i.e., intervention participants) before and after the intervention. The qualitative data was analyzed by using thematic analysis via NVivo12. Results of the visualization task and interview method provided initial evidence of direct and indirect positive contextual spillover effects, with comparatively less evidence a lack of spillover and a relative absence of reported negative spillover. This paper provides a novel theoretical approach, centered on identity process theory to enhance understanding of positive spillover, negative spillover, and the lack of spillover.",Experimentally Induced Empathy Has No Impact on Generosity in a Monetarily Incentivized Dictator Game.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881325,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"In a monetarily incentivized Dictator Game, we expected Dictators' empathy toward the Recipients to cause more pro-social allocations.

They could split the money 8/2 (8€ for Dictator, 2€ for Recipient) or 5/5 (5€ each). Although the empathy manipulation successfully increased Dictators' feelings of empathy toward the Recipients, Dictators' decisions on how to split the money were not affected. We had ample statistical power (above 0.99) to detect a typical social psychology effect (corresponding to r around 0.20).

Aims: We conducted a scoping review to: (a) identify the measures of EF that have been used in studies conducted among adolescents in the past 15 years; (b) identify the most frequently used measures of EF; and (c) establish the psychometric robustness of existing EF measures used with adolescents. Methods: We searched three bibliographic databases (PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, and Web of Science) using key terms ""Adolescents,"" ""Executive Functions,"" and ""measures"". The search covered research articles published between 1st January 2002 and 31st July 2017. Results: We identified a total of 338 individual measures of EF from 705 eligible studies. The vast majority of these studies (95%) were conducted in high income countries. Of the identified measures, 10 were the most used frequently, with a cumulative percent frequency accounting for nearly half (44%) the frequency of usage of all reported measures of EF. These are: Digit Span (count = 160), Trail Making Test (count = 158), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (count = 148), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (count = 140), Verbal Fluency Tasks (count = 88), Stroop Color-Word Test (count = 78), Classical Stroop Task (count = 63), Color-Word Interference Test from Delis-Kaplan battery (count = 62), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (count = 62), and Original Continuous Performance Test (count = 58). In terms of paradigms, tasks from Span (count = 235), Stroop (count = 216), Trails (count = 171), Card sorting (count = 166), Continuous performance (count = 99), and Tower (count = 94) paradigms were frequently used. Only 48 studies out of the included 705 reported the reliability and/or validity of measures of EF used with adolescents, but limited to studies in high income countries. Conclusion: We conclude that there is a wide array of measures for assessing EF among adolescents. Ten of these measures are frequently used. However, the evidence of psychometric robustness of measures of EF used with adolescents remains limited to support the validity of their usage across different contexts.",Gamification as a Sustainable Source of Enjoyment During Balance and Gait Exercises.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881322,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"We may be motivated to engage in a certain motor activity because it is instrumental to obtaining reward (e.g., money) or because we enjoy the activity, making it intrinsically rewarding. Enjoyment is related to intrinsic motivation which is considered to be a durable form of motivation. Therefore, many rehabilitation programs aim to increase task enjoyment by adding game elements (""gamification""). Here we ask how the influence of game elements on motivation develops over time and additionally explore whether enjoyment influences motor performance. We describe two different studies that varied game elements in different exercises. Experiment 1 compared the durability of enjoyment for a gamified and a conventional balance exercise in elderly. Experiment 2 addressed the question whether adding game elements to a gait adaptability exercise enhances the durability of enjoyment and additionally tested whether the game elements influenced movement vigor and accuracy (motor performance). The results show that the game elements enhanced enjoyment. Enjoyment faded over time, but this decrease tended to be less pronounced in gamified exercises. There was no evidence that the game elements affected movement vigor or accuracy.",Correlates of Orthographic Learning in Swedish Children With Cochlear Implants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881321,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"This study set out to explore the cognitive and linguistic correlates of orthographic learning in a group of 32 deaf and hard of hearing children with cochlear implants, to better understand the factors that affect the development of fluent reading in these children. To date, the research about the mechanisms of reading fluency and orthographic learning in this population is scarce. The children were between 6:0 and 10:11 years of age and used oral language as their primary mode of communication. They were assessed on orthographic learning, reading fluency and a range of cognitive and linguistic skills including working memory measures, word retrieval and paired associate learning. The results were analyzed in a set of correlation analyses. In line with previous findings from children with typical hearing, orthographic learning was strongly correlated with phonological decoding, receptive vocabulary, phonological skills, verbal-verbal paired-associate learning and word retrieval. The results of this study suggest that orthographic learning in children with CI is strongly dependent on similar cognitive and linguistic skills as in typically hearing peers. Efforts should thus be made to support phonological decoding skill, vocabulary, and phonological skills in this population.",Impact of Substance Use Disorder Pharmacotherapy on Executive Function: A Narrative Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881320,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Substance use disorders are chronic, relapsing, and harmful conditions characterized by executive dysfunction. While there are currently no approved pharmacotherapy options for stimulant and cannabis use disorders, there are several evidence-based options available to help reduce symptoms during detoxification and aid long-term cessation for those with tobacco, alcohol and opioid use disorders. While these medication options have shown clinical efficacy, less is known regarding their potential to enhance executive function. This narrative review aims to provide a brief overview of research that has investigated whether commonly used pharmacotherapies for these substance use disorders (nicotine, bupropion, varenicline, disulfiram, acamprosate, nalmefene, naltrexone, methadone, buprenorphine, and lofexidine) effect three core executive function components (working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility). While pharmacotherapy-induced enhancement of executive function may improve cessation outcomes in dependent populations, there are limited and inconsistent findings regarding the effects of these medications on executive function. We discuss possible reasons for the mixed findings and suggest some future avenues of work that may enhance the understanding of addiction pharmacotherapy and cognitive training interventions and lead to improved patient outcomes.",Bright Light as a Personalized Precision Treatment of Mood Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881318,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Background: The use of light for its antidepressant action dates back to the beginnings of civilization. Three decades ago, the use of bright-light therapy (BLT) for treating Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) was officially proposed. Since then, a growing scientific literature reports its antidepressant efficacy in both unipolar and bipolar disorders (BD), with or without seasonal patterns. This review aims to examine the management of BLT as a personalized and precision treatment in SAD, unipolar, and BD. Methods: We conducted a narrative review using Medline and Google Scholar databases up to June 2018. Results: BLT has physiological effects by resynchronizing the biological clock (circadian system), enhancing alertness, increasing sleep pressure (homeostatic system), and acting on serotonin, and other monoaminergic pathways. Effects of BLT on mood depend on several factors such as light intensity, wavelength spectrum, illumination duration, time of the day, and individual circadian rhythms. A growing body of evidence has been generated over the last decade about BLT evolving as an effective depression treatment not only to be used in SAD, but also in non-seasonal depression, with efficiency comparable to fluoxetine, and possibly more robust in patients with BD. The antidepressant action of BLT is fast (within 1-week) and safe, with the need in BD to protect against manic switch with mood stabilizers. Side effects might be nausea, diarrhea, headache, and eye irritation, and are generally mild and rare. This good safety profile may be of particular interest, especially in women during the perinatal period or for the elderly. The management of BLT needs to be clarified across mood disorders and future studies are expected to compare different dose-titration protocols, to validate its use as a maintenance treatment, and also to identify predictive biomarkers of response and tolerability. We propose clinical guidelines for BLT use in SAD, non-seasonal depression, and BD. Conclusions : BLT is an efficient antidepressant strategy in mono- or adjunct-therapy, that should be personalized according the unipolar or bipolar subtype, the presence or absence of seasonal patterns, and also regarding its efficacy and tolerability.",The Association Between Dyslipidemia and Lethality of Suicide Attempts: A Case-Control Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881317,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Evidence supports the existence of an association between dyslipidemia, psychiatric disorders, and suicide risk due to the effects of altered lipid profiles on serotoninergic neuron membranes. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in c-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid functioning, total cholesterol, high lipoprotein density cholesterol (HDL-c), low-lipoprotein density cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglycerides (TG) serum levels in low lethality (LLSA) vs. high lethality suicide attempters (HLSA) within 24 h from the suicide attempt and inpatients who never attempted suicide (NAS). After attempting suicide, subjects were admitted to the emergency ward of the IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino and later to the section of Psychiatry from 1st August 2013 to 31st July 2018. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, serum lipids profile, CRP, and thyroid functioning were collected. The sample consisted of 133 individuals with a HLSA, 299 subjects with LLSA, and 200 patients NAS. HLSA subjects were more likely to be males and diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder. Furthermore, HLSA subgroup showed significantly lower total cholesterol and LDL-c levels and higher CRP serum levels compared to LLSA and control group, respectively. LLSA subgroup showed higher HDL-c levels compared to HLSA subgroup (no differences between HLSA and control group were observed). Additionally, the control group reported higher triglycerides levels compared to patients admitted to psychiatric ward for a suicide attempt. Only male gender, having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, lower total cholesterol, and higher CRP serum levels predicted HLSA. Investigating the relation between dyslipidemia and the severity of suicide attempts may contribute to reveal the complex determinants underlying at-risk behaviors such as suicide, thus playing a relevant role in the possible prevention of this disabling phenomenon."

Here, we examined the effect of EET-A, an orally active EET analog, and c-AUCB, an inhibitor of the EETs degrading enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase, on the progression of post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure (HF) in normotensive Hannover Sprague-Dawley (HanSD) and in heterozygous Ren-2 transgenic rats (TGR) with angiotensin II-dependent hypertension. Adult male rats (12 weeks old) were subjected to 60-min left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion or sham (non-MI) operation. Animals were treated with EET-A and c-AUCB (10 and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively) in drinking water, given alone or combined for 5 weeks starting 24 h after MI induction. Left ventricle (LV) function and geometry were assessed by echocardiography before MI and during the progression of HF. At the end of the study, LV function was determined by catheterization and tissue samples were collected. Ischemic mortality due to the incidence of sustained ventricular fibrillation was significantly higher in TGR than in HanSD rats (35.4 and 17.7%, respectively). MI-induced HF markedly increased LV end-diastolic pressure (Ped) and reduced fractional shortening (FS) and the peak rate of pressure development [+(dP/dt)max] in untreated HanSD compared to sham (non-MI) group [Ped: 30.5 ± 3.3 vs. 9.7 ± 1.3 mmHg; FS: 11.1 ± 1.0 vs. 40.8 ± 0.5%; +(dP/dt)max: 3890 ± 291 vs. 5947 ± 309 mmHg/s]. EET-A and c-AUCB, given alone, tended to improve LV function parameters in HanSD rats. Their combination amplified the cardioprotective effect of single therapy and reached significant differences compared to untreated HanSD controls [Ped: 19.4 ± 2.2 mmHg; FS: 14.9 ± 1.0%; +(dP/dt)max: 5278 ± 255 mmHg/s]. In TGR, MI resulted in the impairment of LV function like HanSD rats. All treatments reduced the increased level of albuminuria in TGR compared to untreated MI group, but neither single nor combined EET-based therapy improved LV function. Our results indicate that EET-based therapy attenuates the progression of post-MI HF in HanSD, but not in TGR, even though they exhibited renoprotective action in TGR hypertensive rats.",Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis the Function of RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and Their Prognostic Value in Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881302,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Background and Purpose: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play a vital role in the progression of many cancers. Functional investigation of RBPs may contribute to elucidating the mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, and invasion, therefore providing novel insights into future diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Methods: We downloaded RNA sequencing data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) by UCSC Xena and identified relevant RBPs through an integrated bioinformatics analysis. We then analyzed biological processes of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by DAVID, and established their interaction networks and performed pathway analysis through the STRING database to uncover potential biological effects of these RBPs. We also explored the relationship between these RBPs and the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Results: In the present study, we obtained 1092 breast tumor samples and 113 normal controls. After data analysis, we identified 90 upregulated and 115 downregulated RBPs in breast cancer. GO and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that these significantly changed genes were mainly involved in RNA processing, splicing, localization and RNA silencing, DNA transposition regulation and methylation, alkylation, mitochondrial gene expression, and transcription regulation. In addition, some RBPs were related to histone H3K27 methylation, estrogen response, inflammatory mediators, and translation regulation. Our study also identified five RBPs associated with breast cancer prognosis. Survival analysis found that overexpression of DCAF13, EZR, and MRPL13 showed worse survival, but overexpression of APOBEC3C and EIF4E3 showed better survival. Conclusion: In conclusion, we identified key RBPs of breast cancer through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. These RBPs were involved in a variety of biological and molecular pathways in breast cancer. Furthermore, we identified five RBPs as a potential prognostic biomarker of breast cancer. Our study provided novel insights to understand breast cancer at a molecular level.",High Cortisol and the Risk of Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881301,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Introduction: Cortisol effects on the brain are exerted through two distinct receptors, inducing complex and even opposite effects on the cerebral structures implicated in the various cognitive functions. High cortisol may also have deleterious effects on the brain structures and contribute to neurodegeneration, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), via different mechanisms. Objective: To examine the interrelationships between cortisol, cognitive impairment and AD. Methods: Review of the literature. Results: Clinical studies found that elevated cortisol was associated with poorer overall cognitive functioning, as well as with poorer episodic memory, executive functioning, language, spatial memory, processing speed, and social cognition; while in animals, glucocorticoid administration resulted in cognitive impairment and abnormal behavior. In cognitively healthy subjects, higher cortisol levels have been associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and AD. Subjects with dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD have been found to have higher CSF cortisol levels than cognitively healthy controls. Elevated CSF cortisol may also be associated with a more rapid cognitive decline in MCI due to AD. Elevated cortisol levels have been also found in delirium. High cortisol may mediate the impact of stressful life events, high neuroticism, depression, sleep disturbances, as well as cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive performance, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. High cortisol may also exert neurotoxic effects on the hippocampus, and promote oxidative stress and amyloid β peptide toxicity. Further possible underlying mechanisms include the interactions of cortisol with inflammatory mediators, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. Conclusion: Elevated cortisol levels may exert detrimental effects on cognition and contribute to AD pathology. Further studies are needed to investigate cortisol-reducing and glucocorticoidreceptor modulating interventions to prevent cognitive decline.",Age Affects How Task Difficulty and Complexity Modulate Perceptual Decision-Making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881300,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Decisions differ in difficulty and rely on perceptual information that varies in richness (complexity); aging affects cognitive function including decision-making, and yet, the interaction between difficulty and perceptual complexity have rarely been addressed in aging. Using a parametric fMRI modulation analysis and psychophysics, we address how task difficulty affects decision-making when controlling for the complexity of the perceptual context in which decisions are made. Perceptual complexity was varied in a factorial design while participants made perceptual judgments on the spatial frequency of two patches that either shared the same orientation (simple condition) or were orthogonal in orientation (complex condition). Psychophysical thresholds were measured for each participant in each condition and served to set individualized levels of difficulty during scanning. Findings indicate that discriminability interacts with complexity, to influence decisional difficulty. Modulation as a function of difficulty is maintained with age, as indicated by coupling between increased activation in fronto-parietal regions and suppression in the lateral hubs, however, age has a specific effect in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), driven by performance at near-threshold (difficult) levels for the simpler stimulus combination condition, but not the more complex one. Taken together, our findings suggest that the context of difficulty, or what is perceived as important, changes with age, and that decisions that would seem neutral to younger participants, may carry more emphasis with age.",From the Wet Lab to the Web Lab: A Paradigm Shift in Brain Imaging Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881299,Frontiers in neuroinformatics,2019 03 29,"Web technology has transformed our lives, and has led to a paradigm shift in the computational sciences. As the neuroimaging informatics research community amasses large datasets to answer complex neuroscience questions, we find that the web is the best medium to facilitate novel insights by way of improved collaboration and communication. Here, we review the landscape of web technologies used in neuroimaging research, and discuss future applications, areas for improvement, and the limitations of using web technology in research. Fully incorporating web technology in our research lifecycle requires not only technical skill, but a widespread culture change; a shift from the small, focused ""wet lab"" to a multidisciplinary and largely collaborative ""web lab.""",Computational Model for Human 3D Shape Perception From a Single Specular Image.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881298,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2019 03 29,"In natural conditions the human visual system can estimate the 3D shape of specular objects even from a single image. Although previous studies suggested that the orientation field plays a key role for 3D shape perception from specular reflections, its computational plausibility, and possible mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, to complement the orientation field information, we first add prior knowledge that objects are illuminated from above and utilize the vertical polarity of the intensity gradient. Then we construct an algorithm that incorporates these two image cues to estimate 3D shapes from a single specular image. We evaluated the algorithm with glossy and mirrored surfaces and found that 3D shapes can be recovered with a high correlation coefficient of around 0.8 with true surface shapes. Moreover, under a specific condition, the algorithm's errors resembled those made by human observers. These findings show that the combination of the orientation field and the vertical polarity of the intensity gradient is computationally sufficient and probably reproduces essential representations used in human shape perception from specular reflections.","Brain Activation of Elite Race Walkers in Action Observation, Motor Imagery, and Motor Execution Tasks: A Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881297,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Walking plays an important role in human daily life. Many previous studies suggested that long-term walking training can modulate brain functions. However, due to the use of measuring techniques such as fMRI and PET, which are highly motion-sensitive, it is difficult to record individual brain activities during the movement. This pilot study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the hemodynamic responses in the frontal-parietal cortex of four elite race walkers (experimental group, EG) and twenty college students (control group, CG) during tasks involving action observation, motor imagery, and motor execution. The results showed that activation levels of the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), premotor and supplementary motor cortex (PMC and SMC), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in the EG were significantly lower than in the CG during motor execution and observation tasks. And primary motor cortex (M1) of EG in motor execution task was significantly lower than its in CG. During the motor imagery task, activation intensities of the DLPFC, PMC and SMC, and M1 in the EG were significantly higher than in the CG. These findings suggested that the results of motor execution and observation tasks might support the brain efficiency hypothesis, and the related brain regions strengthened the efficiency of neural function, but the results in motor imagery tasks could be attributed to the internal forward model of elite race walkers, which showed a trend opposed to the brain efficiency hypothesis. Additionally, the activation intensities of the pars triangularis and PMC and SMC decreased with the passage of time in the motor execution and imagery tasks, whereas during the action observation task, no significant differences in these regions were found. This reflected differences of the internal processing among the tasks.",Environmental Programming of Susceptibility and Resilience to Stress in Adulthood in Male Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881296,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Epidemiological evidence identifies early life adversity as a significant risk factor for the development of mood disorders. Much evidence points to the role of early life experience in susceptibility and, to a lesser extent, resilience, to stress in adulthood. While many models of these phenomena exist in the literature, results are often conflicting and a systematic comparison of multiple models is lacking. Here, we compare effects of nine manipulations spanning the early postnatal through peri-adolescent periods, both at baseline and following exposure to chronic social defeat stress in adulthood, in male mice. By applying rigorous criteria across three commonly used measures of depression- and anxiety-like behavior, we identify manipulations that increase susceptibility to subsequent stress in adulthood and other pro-resilient manipulations that mitigate the deleterious consequences of adult stress. Our findings point to the importance of timing of early life stress and provide the foundation for future studies to probe the neurobiological mechanisms of risk and resilience conferred by variation in the early life environment.",Repetitive Passive Movement Modulates Corticospinal Excitability: Effect of Movement and Rest Cycles and Subject Attention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881295,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Repetitive passive movement (PM) affects corticospinal excitability; however, it is unknown whether a duty cycle which repeats movement and rest, or subjects' conscious attention to movements, affects corticospinal excitability. We aimed to clarify the effect of the presence or absence of a duty cycle and subjects' attention on corticospinal excitability. Three experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, PM of the right index finger was performed for 10 min. Three conditions were used: (1) continuous PM (cPM) at a rate of 40°/s; (2) intermittent PM (iPM) with a duty cycle at 40°/s; and (3) iPM at 100°/s. In conditions 1 and 3, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude was significantly reduced. In Experiment 2, PM was performed for 30 min: condition 1 comprised cPM at a rate of 40°/s and Condition 2 comprised iPM at 40°/s. MEP amplitude significantly decreased in both conditions. In Experiment 3, PM was performed for 10 min: condition 1 comprised paying attention to the moving finger during iPM and Condition 2 was similar to Condition 1 but while counting images on a monitor without looking at the movement finger, and Condition 3 comprised counting images on a monitor without performing PM. MEP amplitude significantly increased only under Condition 1. Thus, afferent input from movements above a certain threshold may affect corticospinal excitability reduction. Furthermore, corticospinal excitability increases when paying attention to passive finger movement.",The After-Effects of Theta Burst Stimulation Over the Cortex of the Suprahyoid Muscle on Regional Homogeneity in Healthy Subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881294,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a powerful variant of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), making it potentially useful for the treatment of swallowing disorders. However, how dose TBS modulate human swallowing cortical excitability remains unclear. Here, we aim to measure the after-effects of spontaneous brain activity at resting-state using the regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach in healthy subjects who underwent different TBS protocols over the suprahyoid muscle cortex. Sixty healthy subjects (23.45 ± 2.73 years, 30 males) were randomized into three groups which completed different TBS protocols. The TMS coil was applied over the cortex of the suprahyoid muscles. Data of resting-state functional MRI (Rs-fMRI) of the subjects were acquired before and after TBS. The ReHo was compared across sessions [continuous TBS (cTBS), intermittent TBS (iTBS) and cTBS/iTBS] and runs (pre/post TBS). In the comparison between pre- and post-TBS, increased ReHo was observed in the right lingual gyrus and right precuneus and decreased ReHo in the left cingulate gyrus in the cTBS group. In the iTBS group, increased ReHo values were seen in the pre-/postcentral gyrus and cuneus, and decreased ReHo was observed in the left cerebellum, brainstem, bilateral temporal gyrus, insula and left inferior frontal gyrus. In the cTBS/iTBS group, increased ReHo was found in the precuneus and decreased ReHo in the right cerebellum posterior lobe, left anterior cerebellum lobe, and right inferior frontal gyrus. In the post-TBS inter-groups comparison, increased ReHo was seen in right middle occipital gyrus and decreased ReHo in right middle frontal gyrus and right postcentral gyrus (cTBS vs. cTBS/iTBS). Increased ReHo was shown in left inferior parietal lobule and left middle frontal gyrus (cTBS vs. iTBS). Increased ReHo was shown in right medial superior frontal gyrus and decreased ReHo in right cuneus (cTBS/iTBS vs. iTBS). Our findings indicate cTBS had no significant influence on ReHo in the primary sensorimotor cortex, iTBS facilitates an increased ReHo in the bilateral sensorimotor cortex and a decreased ReHo in multiple subcortical areas, and no reverse effect exhibits when iTBS followed the contralateral cTBS over the suprahyoid motor cortex. The results provide a novel insight into the neural mechanisms of TBS on swallowing cortex."

Here, we investigate the effects of chronic stress on the ability of place cells to encode the neural representation of a linear track. To model physiological conditions of chronic stress on hippocampal function, transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in CA1 pyramidal neurons were chronically administered with 40 μg/ml of cortisol for 8 weeks. Cortisol-treated mice exhibited symptoms typically observed during chronic stress, including diminished reward seeking behavior and reduced adrenal gland and spleen weights. In vivo imaging of hippocampal cellular activity during linear track running behavior revealed a reduced number of cells that could be recruited to encode spatial position, despite an unchanged overall number of active cells, in cortisol-treated mice. The properties of the remaining place cells that could be recruited to encode spatial information, however, was unperturbed. Bayesian decoders trained to estimate the mouse's position on the track using single neuron activity data demonstrated reduced performance in a cue richness-dependent fashion in cortisol-treated animals. The performance of decoders utilizing data from the entire neuronal ensemble was unaffected by cortisol treatment. Finally, to test the hypothesis that an antidepressant drug could prevent the effects of cortisol, we orally administered a group of mice with 10 mg/kg citalopram during cortisol administration. Citalopram prevented the cortisol-induced decrease in single-neuron decoder performance but failed to significantly prevent anhedonia and the cortisol-induced reduction in the proportion place cells. The dysfunction observed at the single-neuron level indicates that chronic stress may impair the ability of the hippocampus to encode individual neural representations of the mouse's spatial position, a function pivotal to forming an accurate navigational map of the mouse's external environment; however, the hippocampal ensemble as a whole is resilient to any cortisol-induced insults to single neuronal place cell function on the linear track.",Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer: When Two Monsters Cannot Be Together.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881282,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer are among the leading causes of human death around the world. While neurodegeneration is the main feature of AD, the most important characteristic of malignant tumors is cell proliferation, placing these two diseases in opposite sides of cell division spectrum. Interestingly, AD and cancer's pathologies consist of a remarkable common feature and that is the presence of active cell cycle in both conditions. In an in vitro model of primary adult neuronal culture, we previously showed that treating cell with beta amyloid forced neurons to start a cell cycle. Instead of cell division, however, neuronal cell cycle was aborted and a massive neurodegeneration was left behind as the consequence. A high level of cell cycle entry, which is a requirement for cancer pathogenesis, was reported in clinically diagnosed cases of AD, leading to neurodegeneration. The diverse clinical manifestation of a similar etiology, have puzzled researchers for many years. In fact, the evidence showed an inverse association between AD and cancer prevalence, suggesting that switching pathogenesis toward AD protects patients against cancer and vice versa. In this mini review, we discussed the possibility of involvement of cell proliferation and survival dysregulation as the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration in AD, and the leading event to develop both disorders' pathology. As examples, the role of phosphoinositide 3 kinase/Akt/ mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathway in cell cycle re-entry and blocking autophagy are discussed as potential common intracellular components between AD and cancer pathogenesis, with diverse clinical diagnosis.",Pituitary Gland Functional Connectivity and BMI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881281,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"The pituitary gland (PG) influences body weight through hormonal releases; however, the relation between body weight and PG's co-activities with other brain regions remains unclear.

Using enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample, PG functional connectivity of 494 individuals was analyzed to assess in voxel-wise fashion. A negative association was found between BMI and PG functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, putamen, and temporal lobe.

It is inherited mainly in autosomal dominant inheritance manner and caused by mutations and deletions in either large or small ribosomal protein genes that results in an imbalance between the biosynthesis of rRNA and ribosomal proteins, eventually the activation and stabilization of p53. Diagnosing DBA is usually problematic due to a partial phenotype and its wide inconsistency in its clinical expression; however, molecular studies have identified a heterozygous mutated gene in up to 50% of the DBA cases and corticosteroid drugs are the backbone treatment options of DBA. Anomalies in bone marrow function in DBA cases are broadly associated with both congenital and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes in human. In this review different literatures were searched in Medline (eg. PubMed, PMC, Hinari, Google scholar), OMIM, EMBASE by using search engines (Google, Yahoo, Baidu Ask.com) and searching was performed by using search key words (DBA, ribosomopathies, Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes, pure red cell aplasia).

Douglas-fir growth correlates with the climate, the soil moisture regime, and the soil nutrient status, reflecting a broad physiological amplitude. Even though planting this non-native tree species is suggested as a viable strategy to improve adaptiveness of European forests to a more extreme climate and to assure future productivity, the expected temperature increase may induce a decline in forest stand productivity for Douglas-fir in already warm and dry regions.
",The effects of huntingtin-lowering: what do we know so far?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881191,Degenerative neurological and neuromuscular disease,2019 03 29,"Therapies targeting mutant huntingtin DNA, mRNA, and protein have a chance at becoming the first disease-modifying treatments for Huntington's disease, a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptom management treatments are available today. This review focuses on evidence addressing several key questions pertinent to huntingtin-lowering, ranging from the functions of wild-type huntingtin (wtHTT) that may be disrupted by huntingtin-lowering treatments through the various ways huntingtin can be lowered, the tolerability of wtHTT-lowering in mice and primates, what has been found in the Ionis Pharmaceutical safety trial of a huntingtin-lowering therapy, and to the question of how much mutant huntingtin may need to be lowered for a therapy to be clinically effective. We conclude that adverse consequences of lowering wtHTT in animals appear to be brain region-specific, and/or dependent upon the animal's stage of development and the amount by which huntingtin is lowered. Therefore, safe approaches to huntingtin-lowering in patients may be to lower huntingtin only moderately, or lower huntingtin only in the most affected brain regions, or lower huntingtin allele-selectively, or all of the above. Many additional questions about huntingtin-lowering remain open, and will only be answered by upcoming clinical trials, such as whether the delivery approaches currently planned will be adequate to get the treatment to the necessary brain regions, and whether non-allele-selective huntingtin-lowering will be safe in the long run. Meantime, there is a role for preclinical research to address key knowledge gaps, including the effects of non-allele-selective huntingtin-lowering on protein trafficking and viability at the cellular level, the tolerability of wtHTT-lowering in the corticostriatal connections of the primate brain, and the effects of this lowering on the functioning of neurotransmitter systems and the transport of neurotrophic factors to the striatum.","Health literacy and knowledge related to tuberculosis among outpatients at a referral hospital in Lima, Peru.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881174,Research and reports in tropical medicine,2019 03 29,"Tuberculosis (TB) case detection in Peru relies on passive case finding.

Features may include dosing reminders, adherence trackers, tools for patient education, and patient diaries to collect patient-reported outcomes, as well as monitoring tools with interfaces between patients and health care professionals (HCPs). Five connected devices have been selected as the basis for a review of the clinical evidence concerning the impact of electronic tools on treatment adherence and efficacy outcomes. Disease areas covered include multiple sclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, liver and renal transplant recipients, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, clinically isolated syndrome, asthma, and COPD. From studies comparing the use of electronic feedback tools to standard of care, there is an initial evidence for a higher adherence to treatment and better outcomes among patients who use the electronic tools. To substantiate the assumption that connected devices can improve adherence in an outpatient setting over a prolonged period of time, further data from controlled randomized studies are required. Key barriers to the broader adoption of connected devices include data privacy laws that may prevent data sharing with HCPs in some countries, as well as the need to demonstrate that the tools are consistently used and generate a high-quality and reproducible database. If these challenges can be addressed in a way that is agreeable to all stakeholders, it is expected that the future value of connected devices will be to 1) facilitate and improve patient involvement in disease management in a flexible care setting, 2) enable early treatment decisions, and 3) complement value-based reimbursement models.",Robustness and lifetime of the bone conduction implant - a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881150,"Medical devices (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 03 29,The objective of this study was to develop methods for evaluating the mechanical robustness and estimating the lifetime of the novel bone conduction implant (BCI) that is used in a clinical study.

First-line treatment involves counseling the patient about decreasing their risk factors, like discontinuing smoking and avoiding medications with suspected association such as NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitor, ranitidine, and sertraline. Starting loperamide for immediate symptomatic relief is used as an adjunct to therapy with glucocorticoids. Budesonide is considered first-line treatment for MC given its favorable side effect profile and good efficacy, though relapse rates are high. Systemic glucocorticoids should be reserved to patients unable to take budesonide.

While PN may serve as a phenotypic presentation of several underlying conditions such as atopic dermatitis, chronic kidney disease-related pruritus, and neurological diseases, it represents a distinct clinical entity that may persist despite the removal of the underlying cause, if one is identified. Neuronal proliferation, eosinophils, mast cells, and small-fiber neuropathy play a role in the production of pruritus in PN, although the exact mechanism has not yet been established. Identifying an underlying cause, if present, is essential to prevent recurrence of PN. Due to often present comorbidities, treatment is typically multimodal with utilization of topical and systemic therapies. We performed a PubMed/MEDLINE search for PN and present a review of recent developments in the treatment of PN. Treatment typically relies on the use of topical or intralesional steroids, though more severe or recalcitrant cases often necessitate the use of phototherapy or systemic immunosuppressives. Thalidomide and lenalidomide can both be used in severe cases; however, their toxicity profile makes them less favorable.

Unfortunately, GBM is resistant to the classic chemotherapy drug, temozolomide (TMZ). As well as its classic DNA-targeting effects, the off-target effects of TMZ can have pro-survival or pro-death roles and regulate GBM chemoradiation sensitivity. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is one of the most common off-target effects. ER stress and its downstream induction of autophagy, apoptosis, and other events have important roles in regulating TMZ sensitivity. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular homeostasis mechanism that is closely associated with ER stress-induced apoptosis. Under ER stress, autophagy cannot only remove misfolded/unfolded proteins and damaged organelles and degrade and inhibit apoptosis-related caspase activation to reduce cell damage, but may also promote apoptosis dependent on ER stress intensity. Although some protein interactions between autophagy and apoptosis and common upstream signaling pathways have been found, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are still not fully understood. This review summarizes the possible mechanisms underlying the current known off-target roles of ER stress and downstream autophagy in the regulation of cell fate and evaluates their role in TMZ treatment and their potential as therapeutic targets.","Lipid nanobubbles as an ultrasound-triggered artesunate delivery system for imaging-guided, tumor-targeted chemotherapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881036,OncoTargets and therapy,2019 03 29,"Herein, this study is to prepare folic acid (FA)-conjugated lipid nanobubbles (NBs) that highly load artesunate (Arte; FA-ALNBs), as an ultrasound (US)-triggered Arte delivery system for imaging-guided, tumor-targeted chemotherapy.",Ubiquitin-specific protease 4 promotes glioblastoma multiforme via activating ERK pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881035,OncoTargets and therapy,2019 03 29,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common brain tumors in adults.

It appears at a high incidence and has a high malignancy, mortality, recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is the main component of caveolae and participates in various biological events. More and more experimental studies have shown that Cav1 plays a critical role in the progression of breast cancer including cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, invasion, migration and breast cancer metastasis. Besides, Cav1 has been found to be involved in chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy resistance, which are still the principal problems encountered in clinical breast cancer treatment. In addition, stromal Cav1 may be a potential indicator for breast cancer patients' prognosis. In the current review, we cover the state-of-the-art study, development and progress on Cav1 and breast cancer, altogether describing the role of Cav1 in breast cancer progression and application in clinical treatment, in the hope of providing a basis for further research and promoting CAV1 gene as a potential target to diagnose and treat aggressive breast cancers.",The first 200 years of cardiac auscultation and future perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881010,Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,2019 03 29,"Cardiac auscultation - even with its limitations - is still a valid and economical technique for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, and despite the growing demand for sophisticated imaging techniques, clinical use of the stethoscope in medical practice has not yet been abandoned. In 1816, René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laënnec invented the stethoscope, while examining a young woman with suspected heart disease, giving rise to mediated auscultation. He described in detail several heart and lung sounds, correlating them with postmortem pathology. Even today, a correct interpretation of heart sounds, integrated with the clinical history and physical examination, allows to detect properly most of the structural heart abnormalities or to evaluate them in a differential diagnosis. However, the lack of organic teaching of auscultation and its inadequate practice have a negative impact on the clinical competence of physicians in training, also reflecting a diminished academic interest in physical semiotic. Medical simulation could be an effective instructional tool in teaching and deepening auscultation. Handheld ultrasound devices could be used for screening or for integrating and improving auscultatory abilities of physicians; the electronic stethoscope, with its new digital capabilities, will help to achieve a correct diagnosis. The availability of innovative representations of the sounds with phono- and spectrograms provides an important aid in diagnosis, in teaching practice and pedagogy. Technological innovations, despite their undoubted value, must complement and not supplant a complete physical examination; clinical auscultation remains an important and cost-effective screening method for the physicians in cardiorespiratory diagnosis.

Twelve consecutive patients with graft infections from 2008 to 2014, treated with Gr-R or NPWT, were enrolled. Those procedures were assessed in complete wound healing, reinfection, amputation, and mortality rate. Five grafts were treated with Gr-R, and seven grafts with NPWT. The initial indications for bypass surgery were claudication, in five grafts treated with Gr-R and three grafts treated with NPWT, and critical limb ischemia in four grafts treated with NPWT. The median time until healing in Gr-R and NPWT was 12 and 59 days, with complete healing seen in 100 and 85.7%, respectively. The major amputation rate was 20 and 14.3%, and reinfection rate was 20 and 14.3%, respectively. There was no perioperative mortality. Gr-R did not show devastating outcome when applied for grafts without limb-threatening ischemia. NPWT showed a low level of invasiveness with excellent results, except for anastomosis site infections. To achieve optimal results, a tailored treatment strategy should be considered."

Concerns have been raised about selection issues, because MTurk workers chose to participate in the platform and select the tasks they perform (of many offered to them). Prior studies have documented demographic and psychological differences with national samples. In this paper we studied evaluative subjective well-being (the Cantril Ladder) in an MTurk sample, a national Internet panel sample, and a national telephone survey conducted by Gallup-Sharecare. A surprising finding was that MTurk participants' Ladder scores were substantial lower than the other two samples. Analyses controlling for six demographic differences among the samples only slightly reduced the mean differences. However, patterns of demographic-well-being associations were similar within the samples. To corroborate these results, we conducted a secondary analysis on another three samples, one MTurk sample and two Internet panel samples. The same group differences in Ladder scores were observed. These findings add to the growing literature documenting the characteristics of MTurk samples and we discuss the implications for future research with such samples.",Pressure from 2D snapshot PIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880869,Experiments in fluids,2019 03 29,"In this study, we quantify the accuracy of a simple pressure estimation method from 2D snapshot PIV in attached and separated flows. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) offers the possibility to acquire a field of pressure instead of point measurements. Multiple methods may be used to obtain pressure from PIV measurements, however, the current state-of-the-art requires expensive equipment and data processing. As an alternative, we aim to quantify the efficacy of estimating instantaneous pressure from snapshot (non-time resolved) two-dimensional planar PIV (the simplest type of PIV available). To make up for the loss of temporal information, we rely on Taylor's hypothesis (TH) to replace temporal information with spatial gradients. Application of our approach to high-resolution 2D velocity data of a turbulent boundary layer flow over ribs shows moderate to good agreement with reference pressure measurements in average and fluctuations. To assess the performance of the 2D TH method beyond average and fluctuation statistics, we acquired a time-resolved measurement of the same flow and determined temporal correlation values of the pressure from our method with reference measurements. Overall, the correlation attains good values for all measured locations. For comparison, we also applied two time-resolved approaches, which attained values of correlation similar to our approach. The performance of the 2D TH method is further assessed on 3D time-resolved velocity data for a turbulent boundary layer and compared with 3D methods. The root-mean-square (RMS) pressure fluctuations of the 2D TH, 3D TH and 3D pseudo-Lagrangian methods closely follow the pressure fluctuation distribution from DNS. These observations on the RMS pressure estimates are further supported by similar analysis on synthetic PIV data (based on DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. The values of spatial correlation between the 2D TH method and the DNS pressure fields in this case, are similar to the temporal correlations achieved in the turbulent flow over the ribs. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of instantaneous pressure estimates and provide a rule of thumb to determine regions where the pressure fluctuation estimate from the 2D TH methods is likely to fail.",Diffusion-controlled crack propagation in alkali feldspar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880868,Physics and chemistry of minerals,2019 03 29,"The chemically driven propagation of interacting parallel cracks in monoclinic alkali feldspar was studied experimentally.

 and close to ambient pressure. Initially, a zone with elevated sodium content formed at the crystal surfaces due to the simultaneous in-diffusion of sodium and out-diffusion of potassium, where the rate of cation exchange was controlled by sodium-potassium interdiffusion within the feldspar. A chemical shift of potassium-rich alkali feldspar towards more sodium-rich compositions produces highly anisotropic contraction of the crystal lattice. This induced a tensile stress state in the sodium-rich surface layer of the crystals, which triggered the formation of a system of nearly equi-spaced parallel cracks oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction of maximum shortening. Crack propagation following their nucleation was driven by cation exchange occurring along the crack flanks and was controlled by the intimate coupling of the diffusion-mediated build-up of a tensile stress state around the crack tips and stress release by successive crack propagation. The critical energy release rate of fracturing was determined as 1.8-2.2

In cooperatively breeding and eusocial taxa, there is potential for parents to strategically manipulate offspring phenotype in their own interests. Social insect queens are nearly always larger than their worker offspring, and queens could benefit by producing small daughter workers in several ways. If queens use aggression to dominate or coerce workers, a queen producing small workers might minimize potential conflict or competition from her offspring. In addition, because of the trade-off between the number of workers she is able to produce and their individual size, a queen may produce small workers to optimize colony work effort. In this study, we investigate why queens of the primitively eusocial paper wasp Polistes gallicus limit the size of their workers. We created queen-worker size mismatches by cross-fostering queens between nests. We then tested whether the queen-worker size difference affects worker foraging and reproductive effort, or the amount of aggression in the group. Some of our results were consistent with the idea that queens limit worker size strategically: small workers were no less successful foragers, so that producing a larger number of smaller workers may overall increase queen fitness. We found that queens were less likely to attack large workers, perhaps because attempting to coerce large workers is riskier. However, larger workers did not forage less, did not invest more in ovarian development, and were not more aggressive themselves. There was therefore little evidence overall that queens limit conflict by producing smaller workers.","Chemistry of a 1,5-Oligosilanylene Dianion Containing a Disiloxane Unit.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880866,Organometallics,2019 03 29,"Synthesis of a number of disiloxane containing cyclo- and bicyclooligosilanes is described starting from the dipotassium 1,5-oligosiloxanylene diide derived from 1,3-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl]tetramethyldisiloxane.

Most current MRF approaches assume that only one tissue is present in each voxel, which neglects intravoxel structure, and may lead to artifacts in the recovered parameter maps at boundaries between tissues. In this work, we propose a multicompartment MRF model that accounts for the presence of multiple tissues per voxel. The model is fit to the data by iteratively solving a sparse linear inverse problem at each voxel, in order to express the measured magnetization signal as a linear combination of a few elements in a precomputed fingerprint dictionary. Thresholding-based methods commonly used for sparse recovery and compressed sensing do not perform well in this setting due to the high local coherence of the dictionary. Instead, we solve this challenging sparse-recovery problem by applying reweighted-𝓁1-norm regularization, implemented using an efficient interior-point method. The proposed approach is validated with simulated data at different noise levels and undersampling factors, as well as with a controlled phantom-imaging experiment on a clinical magnetic-resonance system.",Integer programming model extensions for a multi-stage nurse rostering problem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880861,Annals of operations research,2019 03 18,"In the variant of the well studied nurse rostering problem proposed in the Second International Nurse Rostering Competition, multiple stages have to be solved sequentially which are dependent on each other.

An engine failure results in delays and down-times in the voyage of a vessel, which translates into additional cost and penalties. This paper studies a spare part management problem for maintenance scheduling of a vessel operating on a given route that is defined by a sequence of port visits. When a warning on part failure is received, the problem decides when and to which port each part should be ordered, where the latter is also the location at which the maintenance operation would be performed.

We study this effect in the LOWZ sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using the 'Cosmic Web Reconstruction' filament catalogue. We find that LOWZ galaxies exhibit a small but statistically significant alignment in the direction parallel to the orientation of nearby filaments. This effect is detectable even in the absence of nearby galaxy clusters, which suggests it is an effect from the matter distribution in the filament. A non-parametric regression model suggests that the alignment effect with filaments extends over separations of 30-40 Mpc. We find that galaxies that are bright and early-forming align more strongly with the directions of nearby filaments than those that are faint and late-forming; however, trends with stellar mass are less statistically significant, within the narrow range of stellar mass of this sample.",Orbit determination of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: Status after Seven Years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880841,Planetary and space science,2019 03 29,"The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has been orbiting the Moon since 2009, obtaining unique and foundational datasets important to understanding the evolution of the Moon and the Solar System. The high-resolution data acquired by LRO benefit from precise orbit determination (OD), limiting the need for geolocation and co-registration tasks. The initial position knowledge requirement (50 meters) was met with radio tracking from ground stations, after combination with LOLA altimetric crossovers. LRO-specific gravity field solutions were determined and allowed radio-only OD to perform at the level of 20 meters, although secular inclination changes required frequent updates. The high-accuracy gravity fields from GRAIL, with <10 km spatial resolution, further improved the radio-only orbit reconstruction quality (<10 meters). However, orbit reconstruction is in part limited by the 0.3-0.5 mm/s measurement noise level in S-band tracking. One-way tracking through Laser Ranging can supplement the tracking available for OD with 28-Hz ranges with 20-cm single-shot precision, but is available only on the nearside (the lunar hemisphere facing the Earth due to tidal locking). Here, we report on the status of the OD effort since the beginning of the mission, a period spanning more than seven years. We describe modeling improvements and the use of new measurements. In particular, the LOLA altimetric data give accurate, uniform, and independent information about LRO's orbit, with a different sensitivity and geometry which includes coverage over the lunar farside and is not tied to ground-based assets. With SLDEM2015 (a combination of the LOLA topographic profiles and the Kaguya Terrain Camera stereo images), another use of altimetry is possible for OD. We extend the 'direct altimetry' technique developed for the ICESat mission to perform OD and adjust spacecraft position to minimize discrepancies between LOLA tracks and SLDEM2015. Comparisons with the radio-only orbits are used to evaluate this new tracking type, of interest for the OD of future lunar orbiters carrying a laser altimeter. LROC NAC images also provide independent accuracy estimation, through the repeated views taken of anthropogenic features for instance.",Conflicting intentions: rectifying the consistency requirements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880840,Philosophical studies,2019 03 18,"Many philosophers are convinced that rationality dictates that one's overall set of intentions be consistent. The starting point and inspiration for our study is Bratman's planning theory of intentions. According to this theory, one needs to appeal to the fulfilment of characteristic planning roles to justify norms that apply to our intentions. Our main objective is to demonstrate that one can be rational despite having mutually inconsistent intentions. Conversely, it is also shown that one can be irrational despite having a consistent overall set of intentions. To overcome this paradox, we argue that it is essential for a successful planning system that one's intentions are practically consistent rather than being consistent or applying an aggregation procedure. Our arguments suggest that a new type of norm is needed: whereas the consistency requirement focuses on rendering the contents of one's intentions consistent, our new practical consistency requirement demands that one's intentions be able to simultaneously and unconditionally guide one's action. We observe that for intentions that conform to the 'own-action condition', the practical consistency requirement is equivalent to the traditional consistency requirement. This implies that the consistency requirement only needs to be amended in scenarios of choice under uncertainty.",Model-theoretic semantics and revenge paradoxes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880839,Philosophical studies,2019 03 18,"Revenge arguments purport to show that any proposed solution to the semantic paradoxes generates new paradoxes that prove that solution to be inadequate. In this paper, I focus on revenge arguments that employ the model-theoretic semantics of a target theory and I argue, contra the current revenge-theoretic wisdom, that they can constitute genuine expressive limitations. I consider the anti-revenge strategy elaborated by Field (J Philos Log 32:139-177, 2003; Revenge of the Liar, Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp 53-144, 2007; Saving truth from paradox, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008, §§21-23) and argue that it does not offer a way out of the revenge problem. More generally, I argue that the difference between 'standard' and 'revenge' paradoxes is ill-conceived and should be abandoned. This will contribute to show that the theories that provide a uniform account of truth and other semantic notions are the ones best equipped to avoid the paradoxes altogether-'standard' and 'revenge' alike.","Instability, Rupture and Fluctuations in Thin Liquid Films: Theory and Computations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880838,Journal of statistical physics,2019 05 15,"Thin liquid films are ubiquitous in natural phenomena and technological applications. They have been extensively studied via deterministic hydrodynamic equations, but thermal fluctuations often play a crucial role that needs to be understood. An example of this is dewetting, which involves the rupture of a thin liquid film and the formation of droplets. Such a process is thermally activated and requires fluctuations to be taken into account self-consistently. In this work we present an analytical and numerical study of a stochastic thin-film equation derived from first principles. Following a brief review of the derivation, we scrutinise the behaviour of the equation in the limit of perfectly correlated noise along the wall-normal direction, as opposed to the perfectly uncorrelated limit studied by Grün et al. (J Stat Phys 122(6):1261-1291, 2006). We also present a numerical scheme based on a spectral collocation method, which is then utilised to simulate the stochastic thin-film equation. This scheme seems to be very convenient for numerical studies of the stochastic thin-film equation, since it makes it easier to select the frequency modes of the noise (following the spirit of the long-wave approximation). With our numerical scheme we explore the fluctuating dynamics of the thin film and the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity of rupture. Finally, we study the effect of the noise intensity on the rupture time, using a large number of sample paths as compared to previous studies.","Structural change and economic growth in the British economy before the Industrial Revolution, 1500-1800.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880835,The journal of economic history,2019 03 29,"Structural transformation is a key indicator of economic development. We present the first time series of male labour sectoral shares for England and Wales before 1800, using a large sample of probate and apprenticeship data to produce national and county-level estimates. England experienced a rapid decline in the share of workers in agriculture between the early seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, associated with rising agricultural and especially industrial productivity; Wales saw few changes. Our results show that England experienced unusually early structural change and highlight the mid-seventeenth century as a turning point.",Limited hybridization between introduced and Critically Endangered indigenous tilapia fishes in northern Tanzania.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880834,Hydrobiologia,2019 03 29,"Hybridization between introduced and indigenous species can lead to loss of unique genetic resources and precipitate extinction. In Tanzania, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and blue-spotted tilapia (Oreochromis leucostictus) have been widely introduced to non-native habitats for aquaculture and development of capture fisheries. Here, we aimed to quantify interspecific hybridization between these introduced species and the indigenous species Oreochromis esculentus, Oreochromis jipe and Oreochromis korogwe. In the Pangani basin, several hybrids were observed (O. niloticus × O. jipe, O. leucostictus × O. jipe, O. niloticus × O. korogwe), although hybrids were relatively uncommon within samples relative to purebreds. Hybrids between the native O. jipe × O. korogwe were also observed. In the Lake Victoria basin, no evidence of hybrids was found. Analysis of body shape using geometric morphometrics suggested that although purebreds could be discriminated from one another, hybrids could not be readily identified on body and head shape alone. These results provide the first evidence of hybridization between the introduced species and the Critically Endangered O. jipe in Tanzania. Given uncertainty regarding benefits of introduced species over large-bodied indigenous species in aquaculture and capture fisheries, we suggest that future introductions of hybridization-prone species should be carefully evaluated.",Widespread colonisation of Tanzanian catchments by introduced Oreochromis tilapia fishes: the legacy from decades of deliberate introduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880833,Hydrobiologia,2019 03 29,"From the 1950s onwards, programmes to promote aquaculture and improve capture fisheries in East Africa have relied heavily on the promise held by introduced species. In Tanzania these introductions have been poorly documented. Here we report the findings of surveys of inland water bodies across Tanzania between 2011 and 2017 that clarify distributions of tilapiine cichlids of the genus Oreochromis. We identified Oreochromis from 123 sampling locations, including 14 taxa restricted to their native range and three species that have established populations beyond their native range. Of these three species, the only exotic species found was blue-spotted tilapia (Oreochromis leucostictus), while Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Singida tilapia (Oreochromis esculentus), which are both naturally found within the country of Tanzania, have been translocated beyond their native range. Using our records, we developed models of suitable habitat for the introduced species based on recent (1960-1990) and projected (2050, 2070) East African climate. These models indicated that presence of suitable habitat for these introduced species will persist and potentially expand across the region. The clarification of distributions provided here can help inform the monitoring and management of biodiversity, and inform policy related to the future role of introduced species in fisheries and aquaculture.","An exploration of the links between parasites, trophic ecology, morphology, and immunogenetics in the Lake Tanganyika cichlid radiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880832,Hydrobiologia,2019 03 29,"Differences in habitat and diet between species are often associated with morphological differences. Habitat and trophic adaptation have therefore been proposed as important drivers of speciation and adaptive radiation. Importantly, habitat and diet shifts likely impose changes in exposure to different parasites and infection risk. As strong selective agents influencing survival and mate choice, parasites might play an important role in host diversification. We explore this possibility for the adaptive radiation of Lake Tanganyika (LT) cichlids. We first compare metazoan macroparasites infection levels between cichlid tribes. We then describe the cichlids' genetic diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which plays a key role in vertebrate immunity. Finally, we evaluate to what extent trophic ecology and morphology explain variation in infection levels and MHC, accounting for phylogenetic relationships. We show that different cichlid tribes in LT feature partially non-overlapping parasite communities and partially non-overlapping MHC diversity. While morphology explained 15% of the variation in mean parasite abundance, trophic ecology accounted for 16% and 22% of the MHC variation at the nucleotide and at the amino acid level, respectively. Parasitism and immunogenetic adaptation may thus add additional dimensions to the LT cichlid radiation.",Only true pelagics mix: comparative phylogeography of deepwater bathybatine cichlids from Lake Tanganyika.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880831,Hydrobiologia,2019 03 29,"In the absence of dispersal barriers, species with great dispersal ability are expected to show little, if at all, phylogeographic structure. The East African Great Lakes and their diverse fish faunas provide opportunities to test this hypothesis in pelagic fishes, which are presumed to be highly mobile and unrestricted in their movement by physical barriers. Here, we address the link between panmixis and pelagic habitat use by comparing the phylogeographic structure among four deepwater cichlid species of the tribe Bathybatini from Lake Tanganyika. We show that the mitochondrial genealogies (based on the most variable part or the control region) of the four species are very shallow (0.8-4% intraspecific divergence across entire distribution ranges) and that all species experienced recent population growth. A lack of phylogeographic structure in the two eupelagic species, Bathybates fasciatus and B. leo, was consistent with expectations and with findings in other pelagic cichlid species. Contrary to expectations, a clear phylogeographic structure was detected in the two benthopelagic species, B. graueri and Hemibates stenosoma. Differences in genetic diversity between eupelagic and benthopelagic species may be due to differences in their dispersal propensity, mediated by their respective predatory niches, rather than precipitated by external barriers to dispersal."

An estimated 10.6 million invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs) occur every year, with nearly 1 million deaths in children under 5 years of age. Introduction of vaccines in the childhood immunisation programme in developed world has brought down the incidence of the disease considerably. However, childhood immunocompromising illnesses including HIV have increased the risk of IPD several folds. There is also a growing concern on the increasing antibiotic resistance among these invasive strains to penicillin, other beta-lactams and macrolides, making treatment difficult and expensive. It is estimated that about 62% of IPD worldwide is caused by the 10 most common serotypes. Although the ranking of individual pneumococcal serotypes causing serious disease varies among nations, the 7-13 serotypes included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) may prevent 50%-80% of all paediatric pneumococcal diseases globally. The World Health Organization has recommended the use of PCV-10/13 in the national immunisation programmes (NIPs) of developing countries. Four doses of PCV-13 have been recommended by the US Association of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at intervals of each 2 months for the first 6 months and by the 12th to 15th months after birth. This is expected to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with IPD and simultaneously decrease colonisation with circulating antibiotic-resistant strains in immunized communities. Nevertheless, continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in non-vaccine serotypes is necessary to prevent the resurgence of resistance. Other virulence factors which are not serotype specific also need to be studied to overcome the drawbacks of serotype-specific pneumococcal vaccines.

A total of 48 10-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats, weighing 300-350 g, were randomly divided into the following four groups (n = 12 per group): sham operation (Sham) group, bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) group, losartan-treated BCNI (BCNI + Losartan) group, and bilateral cavernous neurectomy (Neurectomy) group. Losartan was administered once daily by oral gavage at a dose of 30 mg kg-1 day-1 for 4 weeks starting on the day of surgery. The BCNI and the Neurectomy groups exhibited decreases in erectile response and increases in apoptosis and oxidative stress, compared with the Sham group. Treatment with losartan could have a modest effect on erectile function and significantly prevent corporal apoptosis and oxidative stress. The phospho-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated death promoter (p-Bad)/Bad and phospho-the protein kinase B (p-AKT)/AKT ratios were substantially lower, while the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/Bcl-2 ratio, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels, and caspase-3 activity were higher in the BCNI and Neurectomy groups than in the Sham group. After 4 weeks of daily administration with losartan, these expression levels were remarkably attenuated compared with the BCNI group. Taken together, our results suggested that early administration of losartan after CN injury could slightly improve erectile function and significantly reduce corporal apoptosis and oxidative stress by inhibiting the Akt/Bad/Bax/caspase-3 and Nrf2/Keap-1 pathways."

In the year 2017, the Comarca Lagunera registered a dairy cow inventory of 493 144 heads, with 227 142 lactating cows, which produced 2386 million liters of milk per year with an annual average EV of €525.3 million. The EC (€, millions) generated by the GHGE and WFP were €311.8 and €11 980.7, respectively, with a total EC of € 12 292.5 million. When the EV of milk production and the total environmental EC are compared, the contrast demonstrates not only the noteworthy environmental impact but also the significant and senseless biological and EC. In addition, having a large dairy cow concentration creates pollution concerns and the DCPS transfers both nutrients and water resources from an ecologically vulnerable arid region. Therefore, some mitigation strategies such as, better cow genotype, feed and manure management combined with the production of forages and grains in a different geographical region are suggested to promote an optimum use of water in order to uphold the social, economic and biologic sustainability of the Comarca Lagunera, Mexico.",Breastfeeding continuation at 6 weeks postpartum remediates the negative effects of prenatal intimate partner violence on infant temperament.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880656,Development and psychopathology,2019 03 18,"Very little work has examined potential moderating effects in the link between prenatal intimate partner violence (IPV) and infant adjustment, especially in the first critical weeks following delivery. The current study evaluated the protective role of breastfeeding in the relationship between prenatal IPV and infant temperament at 4 months. Pregnant women (n = 82) were interviewed during pregnancy and at 6 weeks and 4 months postpartum. It was hypothesized that (a) prenatal IPV would predict infant temperament outcomes at the 4-month postpartum visit, and (b) breastfeeding continuation at 6 weeks acts as a protective factor such that breastfed infants will be less affected by the risk posed by prenatal IPV. Results indicated direct and negative effects of prenatal IPV on positive affectivity/surgency and orienting/regulatory capacity at 4 months. A significant moderating effect of breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum was identified. Mothers who were not breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum demonstrated the expected negative relationship between prenatal IPV exposure and infant adjustment, but if mothers were breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum, the relationship between IPV exposure and infant positive affectivity/surgency and orienting/regulatory capacity was not significantly different from zero. Results indicate a significant protective effect of breastfeeding in the intergenerational transmission of risk for infants born to mothers exposed to IPV.",Abnormalities of striatal morphology in gambling disorder and at-risk gambling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880655,CNS spectrums,2019 03 18,"The clinical phenotype of gambling disorder (GD) is suggestive of changes in brain regions involved in reward and impulse suppression, notably the striatum.

This situation is aggravated when the main strategy to control worms fails because of the genetic resistance that parasites acquire against anthelmintics. Aiming to anticipate the events involved in anthelmintic resistance, we induced monepantel resistance in H. contortus by in vivo subdosing of sheep hosts. Four successive passages of a monepantel-susceptible H. contortus isolate in Santa Ines or Ile de France sheep hosts resulted in three monepantel-resistant (efficacy varying from 0 to 58.5%) H. contortus isolates. Sheep hosts were treated from 0.075 mg/kg to the therapeutic dose of 2.5 mg/kg of monepantel in 19-26 rounds of selection for 112-133 weeks. Success in inducing H. contortus resistance to monepantel may have been affected by worm burden and by host-parasite interactions, including a possible effect of the breed of sheep hosts. We conclude that subdosing of sheep, although time-consuming, is an efficient in vivo strategy for the induction of monepantel resistance in H. contortus. The resistant parasites can be used in further studies to elucidate the genetic and biochemical events involved in the acquisition of anthelmintic resistance.",Rituximab as a Preemptive Treatment to Prevent Recurrence of Primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis: A Novel Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880653,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2019 05 30,"Primary idiopathic focal segmental glomerulo-sclerosis is a serious disease, frequently progressing to end-stage kidney failure.

Despite empirical evidence addressing the prevalence and impact of WPB, the behavior continues to persist within nursing work environments. Increased conceptual clarity of WPB is needed for interventions to be developed, executed, and evaluated. The purposes of this concept analysis, in which we used Rodgers' evolutionary method, were to obtain a clearer understanding of WPB, to differentiate the concept from other forms of workplace violence, and to describe a definition of WPB consistently used in the literature. Three attributes specific to WPB included negative behaviors directed toward an individual who perceives themselves to be a target, a time frame of experiencing these negative behaviors (e.g., daily or weekly) for a prolonged period (e.g., several weeks), and the inclusion of a power gradient or hierarchy between the bully and target. Antecedents identified for WPB included a scarcity of resources and poor leadership and management. Consequences associated with WPB included adverse nurse, patient, and health care organizational outcomes. WPB was conceptually defined as any negative behavior, exhibited by a nurse of either perceived or actual power, that was repeatedly (i.e., daily or weekly) and persistently directed toward NLRNs who have difficulty defending themselves against the behavior. Implications for researchers, health care organizations, nurse leaders, and nurses are included.","Gender, socioeconomic, medical, and environmental factors related to domestic accidents of the elderly in Spain.

Recent evidence suggests that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) is a potential therapeutic target for treating some highly aggressive solid cancers, including lung, pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancers. Thus, several compounds have been developed for the inhibition of the enzyme activity, but they aren't sufficiently specific and potent. Besides, the crystal structure of this kinase remains unknown. Hence, the functional organization and regulation of eEF-2K remain poorly characterized. For this purpose, we constructed a homology model of eEF-2K and then used docking methodology to better understanding the binding mechanism of eEF-2K with 58 compounds that have been proposed as existing inhibitors. The results of this analysis were compared with the experimental results and the compounds effective against eEF-2K were determined against eEF-2K as a result of both studies. And finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for the stability of eEF-2K with these compounds. According to these study defined that the binding mechanism of eEF-2K with inhibitors at the molecular level and elucidated the residues of eEF-2K that play an important role in enzyme selectivity and ligand affinity. This information may lead to new selective and potential drug molecules to be for inhibition of eEF-2K.",Upper-body repeated-sprint training in hypoxia in international rugby union players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880627,European journal of sport science,2019 03 18,"This study investigated the effects of upper-body repeated-sprint training in hypoxia vs. in normoxia on world-level male rugby union players' repeated-sprint ability (RSA) during an international competition period. Thirty-six players belonging to an international rugby union male national team performed over a 2-week period four sessions of double poling repeated-sprints (consisting of 3 × eight 10-s sprints with 20-s passive recovery) either in normobaric hypoxia (RSH, simulated altitude 3000 m, n = 18) or in normoxia (RSN, 300 m; n = 18). At pre- and post-training intervention, RSA was evaluated using a double-poling repeated-sprint test (6 × 10-s maximal sprint with 20-s passive recovery) performed in normoxia. Significant interaction effects (P < 0.05) between condition and time were found for RSA-related parameters. Compared to Pre-, peak power significantly improved at post- in RSH (423 ± 52 vs. 465 ± 69 W, P = 0.002, η²=0.12) but not in RSN (395 ± 65 vs. 397 ± 57 W). Averaged mean power was also significantly enhanced from pre- to post-intervention in RSH (351 ± 41 vs. 388 ± 53 W, P < 0.001, η²=0.15), while it remained unchanged in RSN (327 ± 49 vs. 327 ± 43 W). No significant change in sprint decrement (P = 0.151, η² = 0.02) was observed in RSH (-17 ± 2% vs. -16 ± 3%) nor RSN (-17 ± 2% vs. -18 ± 4%). This study showed that only four upper-body RSH sessions were beneficial in enhancing repeated power production in international rugby union players. Although the improvement from RSA to game behaviour remains unclear, this finding appears of practical relevance since only a short preparation window is available prior to international games.",Prostaglandin F2-Alpha Eye Drops (Bimatoprost) in Graves' Orbitopathy: A Randomized Controlled Double-Masked Crossover Trial (BIMA Trial).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880626,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,2019 04 09,Previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that prostaglandin F2-alpha (PF2α) reduced proliferation and adipogenesis in a murine cell line and human orbital fibroblasts derived from subjects with inactive Graves' orbitopathy (GO).

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 736 male farmers. Data on the prevalence of chronic diseases and occupational accidents and injuries was collected using an author-developed questionnaire, and the SF-36 questionnaire was used to obtain information on quality of life. Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases was 96.1%. Musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs), eye diseases and neurology diseases were the most prevalent diseases. Almost half of the farmers (42.7%) had experienced an occupational accident during the last 12 months and cuts and fractures accounted for the most frequent injuries. Sick leave was reported by 28.2% of the farmers and from those with history of accidents, 21.4% were hospitalized. A significant association was found between age and education level with quality of life. Most of the chronic diseases showed a significant and inverse association with quality of life, however, the strongest association was found for MSDs and mental disorders. Furthermore, the most important injury associated with quality of life was cuts and fractures. Conclusions: Based on the results, MSDs, mental disorders, and cut and fractures were the main determinants of the farmers' quality of life. Hence, a better quality of life among farmers is especially dependent on eliminating ergonomics risk factors leading to developing musculoskeletal disorders, improving psychosocial work climate, and promoting occupational and personal safety culture.",Transgender and non-binary Australians' experiences with healthcare professionals in relation to fertility preservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880612,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 03 18,"While transitioning gender historically precluded many transgender people from conceiving (more) children, there is now the option to undertake fertility preservation. However, the uptake of this option to date has been low. In order to extend existing limited research on the topic, this paper draws on responses to a questionnaire survey provided by 409 transgender and non-binary adults in Australia, which explored their experiences related to fertility preservation. The paper specifically focuses on the experiences of 295 participants who responded to open-ended questions about their experiences with, and views of, healthcare professionals in regard to fertility preservation. A thematic analysis indicated that healthcare professionals undertake a range of roles with regard to fertility preservation, some viewed positively (e.g. as providers of information), and some viewed negatively (e.g. as potential gatekeepers). The paper concludes by arguing that professionals need to ensure that transgender and non-binary people are provided with enough information, support and opportunity to make an informed decision about fertility preservation. The discussion includes a consideration of interweaving factors, particularly costs, and recommendations for further research that may inform clinical guidelines and training."

The purpose of this study is to contribute to theoretical understandings of men's employment-related mental health experience and raise possibilities for gender-responsive employer supports for men's mental health. Specifically, this study is a secondary analysis of narrative accounts from 18 men employed in male-dominated occupations about their employment-related mental health. Results of this study present evidence of processes by which theoretical concepts of masculine role norms influence work-related stress and mental health including: (a) injunctive norms, which operate through an internal sense of the cultural ""shoulds"" and ""should nots""; (b) descriptive norms, which are communicated through the behaviors that a man sees other men enacting in his immediate environment; and (c) cohesive norms, which exert influence through observations of how men who are leaders, behave. Men's insights into the complexity of employment-related stress and mental health according to masculine role norms related to work demands and leadership modeling and messaging are discussed.

A new epistemic practice of microeconomic forecasting undergirded this attempt to make the distant future part of the political present. Taking the construction of the economic growth potential of performance pay as a starting point, this article analyzes how microeconomic forecasting emerged in one of the world's oldest forecasting bureaus - and to what consequences. First, it highlights the institutional preconditions for this 'turn to micro' in an institution that had pioneered in the field of macroeconomic forecasting. Second, the article analyzes microeconomic forecasting as a distinct epistemic practice that brings different forms of economic expertise together to make the future of educational reforms commensurable. Finally, it analyzes the political consequences of this new epistemic practice in the sense that it not only enables but simultaneously limits the provision of policy-relevant evidence. Beyond the specificities of the case, the article contributes to the sociological study of economic policy devices against the background of a predominant market bias in the STS research on economics.","Generation of Anterior Hindbrain-Specific, Glial-Restricted Progenitor-Like Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880587,Stem cells and development,2019 05 15,"Engraftment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which form myelinating oligodendrocytes, has the potential to treat demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. However, conventional strategies for generating oligodendrocytes have mainly focused on direct differentiation into forebrain- or spinal cord-restricted oligodendrocytes without establishing or amplifying stem/progenitor cells. Taking advantage of a recently established culture system, we generated expandable EN1- and GBX2-positive glial-restricted progenitor-like cells (GPLCs) near the anterior hindbrain. These cells expressed PDGFRα, CD9, S100β, and SOX10 and mostly differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes and MBP-positive oligodendrocytes. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the transcriptome of GPLCs was similar to that of O4-positive OPCs, but distinct from that of rosette-type neural stem cells. Notably, engrafted GPLCs not only differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes but also myelinated the brains of adult shiverer mice 8 weeks after transplantation. Our strategy for establishing anterior hindbrain-specific GPLCs with gliogenic potency will facilitate their use in the treatment of demyelinating diseases and studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying glial development in the hindbrain.",Exploring Genetic Diversity and Signatures of Horizontal Gene Transfer in Nodule Bacteria Associated with Lotus japonicus in Natural Environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880586,Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,2019 03 18,"To investigate the genetic diversity and understand the process of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in nodule bacteria associated with Lotus japonicus, we analyzed sequences of three housekeeping and five symbiotic genes using samples from a geographically wide range in Japan. A phylogenetic analysis of the housekeeping genes indicated that L. japonicus in natural environments was associated with diverse lineages of Mesorhizobium species, whereas the sequences of symbiotic genes were highly similar between strains, resulting in remarkably low nucleotide diversity at both synonymous and non-synonymous sites. Guanine-cytosine content values were lower in symbiotic genes, and relative frequencies of recombination between symbiotic genes were also lower than those between housekeeping genes. An analysis of molecular variance showed significant genetic differentiation among populations in both symbiotic and housekeeping genes. These results confirm that the Mesorhizobium genes required for symbiosis with L. japonicus behave as a genomic island (i. e. a symbiosis island) and suggest that this island has spread into diverse genomic backgrounds of Mesorhizobium via HGT events in natural environments. Furthermore, our data compilation revealed that the genetic diversity of symbiotic genes in L. japonicus-associated symbionts was among the lowest compared with reports of other species, which may be related to the recent population expansion proposed in Japanese populations of L. japonicus.",Association between HIV/AIDS knowledge and stigma towards people living with HIV/AIDS in Botswana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880585,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2019 05 01,"In Botswana, an estimated 350 000 people live with HIV/AIDS.

These findings imply that programmes and interventions that increase HIV/AIDS knowledge may reduce the pervasive apprehension, blame, and stigmatising attitude held towards PLWHA in Botswana.",Factors associated with adherence to ARV treatment in people living with HIV/AIDS in a rural area (Koula-Moutou) in East Gabon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880584,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2019 05 01,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of socio-clinical factors on adherence to antiretroviral treatment in people living with HIV/AIDS in Koula-Moutou (a rural area of Gabon). Two adherence assessment methods based on patient declaration and compliance with pharmacy visits were used to determine qualitative and quantitative aspects of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The quantitative (82.2%) and qualitative (79.5%) adherences to ART declared by patients were higher than those obtained through pharmacy visit assessment methods (15.8% and 45.2%, respectively). Moreover, the declarative and pharmacy visit compliance methods showed fair agreement (quantitative Kappa = 0.317; qualitative Kappa = 0.311). A better quantitative or qualitative declarative adherence was associated with a lower level of education (P = 0.05 and P = 0.025 respectively). This study reported for the first time the factors influencing adherence to ART in a rural area of East Gabon. We recommend further investigations in a large cohort to better assess the impact of socio-clinical factors on ART adherence in a vulnerable group of patients.","Informal transit, socio-spatial exclusion, and changing geographies of HIV/AIDS in urban Malawi.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880583,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2019 05 01,"The role played by the transport sector in the regional spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is well known, yet attention has remained confined to entertainment hotspots and stopping places along long-distance highways and cross-border transport corridors. This paper draws attention to informal modes of transit prevalent in sub-Saharan African cities, by linking the rise of two-wheeled, manually operated bicycles, known as ""Sacramento"", to the potential spread of HIV and AIDS in Malawi. The findings of a qualitative study from Mzuzu city show that Sacramento operators are prone to demanding or accepting sexual favours from female commuters as payment for a ride. We draw on complementary theories of the political ecology of health (PEH) and feminist political ecology to show how a popular belief that Sacramento is an inferior mode of urban transit underpins risky sexual behaviour among men hired to operate this informal mode transport. The findings further show that operators' responses to this perceived inferiority are themselves also driven by gender discourses that seek to validate their identities as powerful go-getters. These scripts also create an environment that fosters multiple sexual partners and venerates unprotected sex. Because Sacramento is both a source of livelihood and an HIV risk milieu, it epitomises the contraction inherent in HIV and AIDS vulnerability in sub-Saharan Africa.","Determinants of risky sexual behaviours among adolescents in Central African Republic, Eswatini and Ghana: evidence from multi-indicator cluster surveys.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880582,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2019 05 01,"Despite the declining HIV/AIDS prevalence globally, nearly half of all new HIV infections still occur among youth, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. While determinants of risky sexual behaviour have received copious attention in the literature, we still lack multi-country studies that track regional changes in sexual risk among youth in sub-Saharan Africa. This study seeks to fill part of this gap by identifying the determinants of risky sexual behaviours among adolescents in Ghana, Central African Republic (CAR) and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). We used nationally representative sample data from the Multi Indicator Cluster survey, round four (MICS4). Results of the descriptive analysis show that overall consistent condom use is still extremely low in sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana, only 8.5% of male youth and 7% of female youth consistently use condoms. In CAR this figure is 8% and 4% in male youth and female youth respectively. In Eswatini, with one of highest HIV prevalence in the world, the prevalence of consistent condom use is at 29% in males and 20% in females, higher than both in Ghana and CAR. Results of hierarchical models show that age at first sex does not predict risky sexual behaviour in Ghana, but it does predict risky sexual behaviour in CAR although only among young males. In Swaziland, age at first sex predicts risky sexual behaviour in both male and female youth but the relationship is not in the expected direction. Low socio-economic status predicts inconsistent condom use in all the three countries, but only among young females. This paper provides relevant policy lessons and recommendations.","The influence of marital status on HIV infection in an HIV hyperendemic area of rural South Africa, 2000-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880581,African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2019 05 01,"Marital status is one of the factors whose impact on HIV infection has always been studied but contradictory findings have been reported. The drastic changes in marriage patterns in South Africa influences the role of marital status on HIV infection. This study aims to give evidence-based information on the association between marital status and HIV infection in a hyperendemic HIV area in rural South Africa. This study was conducted on longitudinal data collected from the African Health Research Institute (AHRI) based in northern rural KwaZulu-Natal from 2000 to 2017 using multivariable Cox regression. The multivariable Cox regression results found marital status to be a significant factor of HIV infection. Compared to those who were married, the risk of HIV infection was approximately two times in those who were never married while those who were widowed presented as much as twice the risk of HIV infection. In addition, less educated participants were at more risk of HIV infection than those with tertiary education. Furthermore, as expected, the risk of HIV infection increased with age (20-24 HR: 3.05 (2.32-4.02); 25-34 HR: 3.98 (3.12-5.07) and 35-49 HR: 4.36 (3.36-5.67). Women were more susceptible to HIV infection than men were. This study found marital status to be an influential factor of HIV infection together with other socio-economic and demographic factors. This finding will help guide policy makers on empowerment programmes and policies targeting HIV and other health related issues in rural South Africa."

Among the plenty of uncovered MSCs sources, desquamated endometrium collected from the menstrual blood probably remains the most accessible. Though numerous studies have been published on human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMESCs) properties in the past years, there are only a few data regarding their genetic modulation. Moreover, there is a lack of information about the fate of the transduced hMESCs. The present study aimed to optimize hMESCs transduction parameters and apply Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology for genome and secretome modification. The fate of hMESCs transduced either in presence of polybrene (Pb) or protamine sulfate (Ps) was assessed by alterations in CD expression profile, growth rate, cell size, migration capability, osteogenic, adipogenic, and decidual differential potentials. Here, we postulated that the use of Ps for hMESCs genetic manipulations is preferable, as it has no impact on the stem-cell properties, whereas Pb application is undesirable, as it induces cellular senescence. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was selected for further targeted hMESCs genome and secretome modification using CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The obtained data provide optimized transduction scheme for hMESCs and verification of its effectiveness by successful hMESCs genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.",Doxorubicin-loaded Fe3O4-ZIF-8 nano-composites for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880566,Journal of biomaterials applications,2019 05 15,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and malignant cancers and has no effective therapeutic approaches. Chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used for HCC therapy, but its application is limited by the clinical toxicity. In the present study, an Fe3O4-ZIF-8 magnetic nano-composite was fabricated and used for DOX delivery for HCC therapy. The morphology, structure and property of Fe3O4-ZIF-8 nano-composites were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms studies. The drug release from DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 was measured in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline. The cellular uptake ability of DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 into hepatocarcinoma cell line (MHCC97H) was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The effects of Fe3O4-ZIF-8, DOX and DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 against MHCC97H cells were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry assay. Fe3O4-ZIF-8 nano-composites were synthesized and used as a nano-carrier for the delivery of DOX. Because of high drug loading property of ZIF-8, 1 mg Fe3O4-ZIF-8 nano-composites loaded 120 μg DOX when DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 was synthesized in 30 mg/mL DOX solution. The cumulative DOX release curve showed a slow and sustained release pattern over time. The results of CCK-8 assay showed that Fe3O4-ZIF-8 was nontoxic to MHCC97H cells, and DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 presented effective inhibiting effect on cell viability of MHCC97H cells. Cellular uptake assay showed that DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 accumulated in both cytoplasm and nuclei. Moreover, because of valid drug accumulation, DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 exhibited a good inducing effect on cell apoptosis of MHCC97H cells. In conclusion, based on the nontoxic and high drug loading capability of Fe3O4-ZIF-8, DOX@Fe3O4-ZIF-8 presented enhanced effects on HCC cells compared to free DOX, indicating its potential for the chemotherapy of HCC.",Biodegradable hybrid mesoporous silica nanoparticles for gene/chemo-synergetic therapy of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880565,Journal of biomaterials applications,2019 05 15,"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have been extensively explored in anticancer nanomedicine due to their excellent biodegradability, which is one important focus in their further clinical translations. However, the traditional design concepts based on the functional modification with active groups cannot significantly improve the controlled drug release efficiency and anticancer effect. Herein, a molecularly organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silica nanoparticle (HMSN) nanocarrier coated with hyaluronic acid (HA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) was constructed for the gene/chemo-synergetic therapy of breast cancer. Notably, HMSN with tumor-sensitive disulfide bond and targeting ligand HA can be decomposed when it encounters high concentration of glutathione (GSH) and hyaluronidase (HAase). The biodegradability of host molecules and the fast disintegration of the framework in tumor microenvironment can also accelerate the stimuli responsive release of cargos inside the pore space. Furthermore, the grafting of polyethyleneimine (PEI) could increase gene loading efficiency. From the above, the smart approach involves a combination of biodegradability and biological effect and results in synergetic antitumor effect of gene and chemical drug on breast cancer. All these findings demonstrated that HMSN/HA/PEI nanocarriers can be suitable for biomedical application, paving the way to fast development of multi-functional nano-biomedicine.",Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity of bioactive hydroxyapatite/silver nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880564,Journal of biomaterials applications,2019 05 15,"Biomaterials are often used in orthopedic surgery like cavity fillings. However, related complications often require long-term systemic antibiotics, device removal, and extended rehabilitation. Hydroxyapatite/silver (HA/Ag) composites have been proposed as implantation biomaterials owing to the osteogenic properties of hydroxyapatite and to the antimicrobial efficiency of silver. Nevertheless, higher silver concentrations induce cytotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to synthesize and characterize HA/Ag nanocomposites that will allow us to use lower concentrations of silver nanoparticles with better antimicrobial efficiency and anti-inflammatory properties. The characterization of HA/Ag was performed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser diffraction. Bioactivity was evaluated under a simulated body fluid. The viability of osteoblast like-cells (MG-63) was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the standard McFarland method. The detection of nitric oxide was measured by a colorimetric assay and the inflammatory cytokines by flow cytometry. We obtained particulate composites of calcium phosphates identified as hydroxyapatite and silver nanoparticles. The bioactivity of the HA/Ag nanocomposites on SFB was confirmed by apatite formations. The viability of MG-63 cells was not affected. We also found antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans owing to the presence of silver nanoparticles at non-cytotoxic concentrations. HA/Ag reduced the release of nitric oxide and decreased the secretion of IL-1 and TNF-α in cells stimulated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In conclusion, the inflammatory and antimicrobial capacity of the HA/Ag nanocomposites, as well as its bioactivity and low cytotoxicity make it a candidate as an implantation biomaterial for bone tissues engineering and clinical practices in orthopedic, oral and maxillofacial surgery.",What is the impact of introducing inpatient electronic prescribing on prescribing errors? A naturalistic stepped wedge study in an English teaching hospital.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880563,Health informatics journal,2019 03 18,"Most studies evaluating the impact of electronic prescribing on prescribing safety have used comparatively weak study designs such as uncontrolled before-and-after studies. This study aimed to apply a more robust naturalistic stepped wedge study design to compare the prevalence and types of prescribing errors for electronic prescribing and paper prescribing. Data were collected weekly during a phased electronic prescribing implementation across 20 wards in a large English hospital. We identified 511 (7.8%) erroneous orders in 6523 paper medication orders, and 312 (6.0%) in 5237 electronic prescribing orders. Logistic regression suggested no statistically significant effect of electronic prescribing use or of study week; patient and ward had significant effects. Errors involving incorrect doses and illegible or incomplete orders were less common with electronic prescribing; those involving duplication, omission, incorrect drug and incorrect formulation were more common. Actions are needed to mitigate these error types; future studies should give more consideration to the effects of patient and ward.","Searching for the ""Active Ingredients"" in Physical Rehabilitation Programs Across Europe, Necessary to Improve Mobility in People With Multiple Sclerosis: A Multicenter Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880560,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,2019 05 23,Physical rehabilitation programs can lead to improvements in mobility in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).,Is there a role for mindfulness-based interventions (here defined as MBCT and MBSR) in facilitating optimal psychological adjustment in the menopause?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880559,Post reproductive health,2019 03 18,"The menopause presents many challenges for middle-aged women worldwide, often highly productive women who are in the prime of their lives juggling busy careers and family responsibilities, when good quality of life and functional ability is an imperative. Some women cope well with their menopausal symptoms and seem to embrace this time of change, while others struggle psychologically to adjust to the changes. Mindfulness-based interventions have a robust evidence base in relation to their efficacy in both physical and psychological conditions. Both programs have been adapted for conditions where difficulties in psychological adjustment to change and/or loss are amongst the core mechanisms that maintain distress. I explored the potential aetiology of distress in the menopause and evaluated existing empirical literature to ascertain whether there is a role for mindfulness-based interventions to facilitate optimal psychological adjustment to changes in the menopause, paying particular attention to the mechanisms that lend themselves to mindfulness training being efficacious. Current available evidence is promising and supports the hypothesis that mindfulness-based interventions may have a role in facilitating psychological adjustment during the menopause transition. The dearth of literature specific to mindfulness-based interventions and the menopause was noted.",Diet-regulated behavior: FVB/N mice fed a lean diet exhibit increased nocturnal bouts of aggression between littermates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880558,Laboratory animals,2019 03 18,"The hyperactive FVB/N inbred mouse strain is widely used for transgenic research applications, although rarely for behavioral studies. These mice have visual impairments via retinal degeneration, but are considered highly intelligent and rely largely on olfaction. While investigating diet-induced obesity in autotaxin transgenic FVB/N mice, we observed an increase in the necessity for male, but not female, cage separations. Based on the observations, we hypothesized that feeding FVB/N mice a lean diet increases nocturnal bouts of aggression between male littermates. The diets of adult littermates were switched from normal chow to either ad libitum high-fat (45% fat) or lean (10% fat) matched diets for 27 weeks, whereby the mice reached an average of 43 g versus 35 g, respectively. Then, cage separations due to nocturnal bouts of aggression became mandatory, even though littermates peacefully cohabitated for 10-16 weeks previously. Since the data was of an unusual nature, it required uncommon statistical methods to be engendered to evaluate whether and where significance existed. Therefore, utilizing the randomization and population models, we established a methodology and postulated that either testosterone, the autotaxin transgene or diet alteration was the causal factor. Statistical evaluation demonstrated a significant correlation between cage separations and aggressive behavior associated with the lean-diet-fed mice, not autotaxin. Biochemical data did not appear to explain the behavior. In contrast, energy metabolism highlighted differences between the groups of normally hyperactive mice by diet. This characteristic makes FVB/N male mice unsuitable subjects for long-term studies with lean-diet modifications.",Activity of Demethylation Inhibitor Fungicide Metconazole on Chinese Fusarium graminearum Species Complex and Its Application in Carbendazim-Resistance Management of Fusarium Head Blight in Wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880557,Plant disease,2019 05 08,"Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, has species-specific geographical distributions in wheat-growing regions. In recent years, benzimidazole resistance of FHB pathogens has been largely widespread in China. Although the demethylation inhibitor fungicide metconazole has been used for FHB control in some countries, no information about metconazole sensitivity of Chinese FHB pathogen populations and efficacy of metconazole in FHB control in China is available. In this study, the sensitivity of FGSC to metconazole was measured with 32 carbendazim-sensitive strains and 35 carbendazim-resistant strains based on mycelial growth. The 50% effective concentration values of 67 strains were normally distributed and ranged from 0.0209 to 0.0838 μg ml-1, with a mean of 0.0481 ± 0.0134 μg ml-1. No significant difference in metconazole sensitivity was observed between carbendazim-sensitive and -resistant populations. An interactive effect of metconazole and phenamacril, a novel cyanoacrilate fungicide approved in China against Fusarium spp., in inhibiting mycelial growth showed an additive interaction at different ratios. Furthermore, field trials to evaluate the effect of metconazole and metconazole + phenamacril treatments in FHB control, deoxynivalenol (DON) production, and grain yields were performed. Compared with the fungicides carbendazim and phenamacril currently used in China, metconazole exhibits a better efficacy for FHB control, DON production, and grain yields, and dramatically reduces use dosages of chemical compounds in the field. The mixture of metconazole and phenamacril at ratios of 2:3 and 1:2 showed the greatest efficacy for FHB control, DON production, and grain yields among all the fungicide treatments but its use dosages were higher in comparison with metconazole alone. In addition, FHB control, grain yields, and DON levels were significantly correlated with each other, showing that visual disease indices can be used as an indicator of grain yields and DON contamination. Meanwhile, the frequency of carbendazim-resistant alleles in F. graminearum populations was dramatically reduced after metconazole and phenamacril alone and the mixture of metconazole and phenamacril applications, indicating that metconazole and a mixture of metconazole and phenamacril can be used for carbendazim resistance management of FHB in wheat. Overall, the findings of this study provide important data for resistance management of FHB and reducing DON contamination in wheat grains.",Determining the Sources of Primary and Secondary Inoculum and Seasonal Inoculum Dynamics of Fungal Pathogens Causing Fruit Rot of Deciduous Holly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880556,Plant disease,2019 05 08,"Fruit rot of deciduous holly, caused by species of the genera Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, and Epicoccum, is affecting plant production in Midwestern and Eastern U.S. nurseries. To determine the sources of inoculum, dormant twigs and mummified fruit were collected, and leaf spot development was monitored throughout the season from three Ohio nurseries over two consecutive years. Mummified fruit was the main source of primary inoculum for species of Alternaria and Epicoccum, whereas mummified fruit and bark were equally important for species of Colletotrichum and Diaporthe. Brown, irregular leaf spots developed in the summer, and disease incidence and severity increased along with leaf and fruit development. Coalesced leaf spots eventually resulted in early plant defoliation. When tested for their pathogenicity on fruit, leaf spot isolates were able to infect wounded mature fruit and induce rot symptoms, which indicated that leaf spots could serve as a source of secondary inoculum for fruit infections. In addition, spore traps were used to monitor seasonal inoculum abundance in the nurseries. Fruit rot pathogens were captured by the spore traps throughout the season, with peak dissemination occurring during flowering. In this study, we also attempted to understand the role of environmental factors on leaf spot development. Although leaf spot incidence and severity were negatively correlated to mean maximum, minimum and average temperature, a decrease in temperature also coincided with leaf senescence. The role of temperature on leaf spot development should be further studied to fully interpret these results."

Materials and methods: Data were prospectively collected at the national UroLap database. The database was established in 2003 in Denmark to register all laparoscopic urological procedures as well as their peri- and post-operative outcomes. In the period from 2009-2014, 10,843 patients were registered with the database, of which 10,546 (97%) had a complete Clavien-Dindo score within the first 30 postoperative days. Results: The mean age of patients was 60.5 years (S.D. = 16.2), and 415 patients (4%) were under the age of 17 years. The male-to-female ratio was 4:1.

The several studies performed on these lizard groups are based on taxonomy and systematics. Although there were several taxonomic or systematic researches on some species of this group, the phylogeographical pattern and species disturbing boundaries of this group is still not clear. In the present study, we aimed to resolve the taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships of the red-bellied lizards in Turkey, based on two combined mitochondrial gene fragments and one protein-coding nuclear gene (rag1). Also, we evaluated ecological niches differentiations among red-bellied lizard groups. The mitochondrial DNA genes were found to be highly polymorphic in this group. One hundred and one variable nucleotide sites were detected on the combined gene sequences. According to phylogenetic trees based on the maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI), the red-bellied lizards group have three species groups; Darevskia parvula, D. adjarica and unnamed Darevskia sp. (candidate species for Darevskia genus). This situation was supported by high bootstrap and posterior probability values in the trees of mitochondrial DNA gene fragments. However, no genetic variation was detected according to nuclear DNA (rag1) sequence. Because the species groups have no overlaps in terms of their ecological niches, ecological niche modelling (ENM) results revealed differences among the groups of D. parvula, D. adjarica, and unnamed Darevskia sp. Besides, we detected no geographical overlaps among three species groups, since there were geographical isolation zones among the species groups of red-bellied lizard.",A case-control study of paternal and maternal age as risk factors in mood disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880518,International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,2019 06 03,"Objective: Advanced parental age might constitute a risk factor for various disorders. We tested whether this concerns also mood disorder patients. Methods: The study included 314 subjects (42 bipolar-BD patients; 21 manics and 21 depressives, 68 unipolar-UD, and 204 normal controls-NC). Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and the calculation of the Relative Risk (RR) and the Odds Ratio (OR) were used for the analysis. Results: Paternal age differed between NC and UD patients (29.42 ± 6.07 vs. 32.12 ± 5.54; p = .01) and manics (29.42 ± 6.07 vs. 35.00 ± 5.75; p = .001) and maternal age between NC and manics (25.46 ± 4.52 vs. 31.43 ± 4.75; p < .001) and manic and UD (31.43 ± 4.75 vs. 26.75 ± 6.03; p = .002). The RR and OR values suggested that advanced parental age constitutes a risk factor for the development of mood disorders. Conclusions: In a non-dose dependent and gender-independent, advanced parental age constitutes a risk factor for the development of BD with index episode of mania (probably manic predominant polarity); only advanced paternal age constitutes a risk factor for the development of UD and BD with index episode of depression (probably depressive predominant polarity). This is the first study suggesting differential effect of advanced parental age depending on predominant polarity of BD.",Firework Injuries of the Hand: An Analysis of Treatment and Health Care Utilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880517,"Hand (New York, N.Y.)",2019 03 18,Firework injuries to the hand can be devastating due to the explosive and ballistic nature of these devices.

It is more prevalent in the elderly population. Recently updated American and European guidelines recommend treating every elderly patient with hypertension independent of age, starting with a low dose of antihypertensive drugs. However, little information is available on the optimal dosages of antihypertensive drugs to treat the elderly safely. Areas covered: Comorbidities, co-medication and frailty status can alter the clinical outcome of drug treatment and can cause adverse events in the elderly. Also, due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes the interpatient variability when using antihypertensive drugs is considerable. In this review, an overview is given on the extent to which the previously mentioned parameters are changed in elderly patients and what this means for the exposure to antihypertensive medication. Also, recommendations on the starting dose of the most frequently used antihypertensive drugs are given based on literature data. Expert opinion: We believe that recommendations on starting dosages followed by a stepwise increase of dosages will lead to improved blood pressure control and less adverse drug reactions in the elderly patient.

Because IP rights impose social costs on the public by limiting access to protected work, the law can be justified only to the extent that, on balance, it encourages enough creation and dissemination of new works to offset those costs. The scale is thus a potent rhetorical trope of fairness and objectivity, but also an instrument the law thinks with - one that is constantly invoked to justify or to question the extent of available IP protection. The balancing act that underlies the legitimacy of IP is, however, literally impossible to perform. Because we are unable to measure the benefits that IP has for inventors or the costs it has for the public, the scale has nothing to weigh. It conveys a clear sense that IP law can be balanced, but in fact propagates only a visible simulacrum of balance - one that is as empty as it is powerful.",Exploitation of enrofloxacin-loaded docosanoic acid solid lipid nanoparticle suspension as oral and intramuscular sustained release formulations for pig.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880494,Drug delivery,2019 03 29,"In our previous study, enrofloxacin-loaded docosanoic acid solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) could be effectively delivered to cells in vitro.

Results: The LH-SLNs had PS of 139.8 ± 5.5 nm, EE of 79.10 ± 2.50% and zeta potential of -30.8 ± 3.5 mV. TEM images showed that LH-SLNs had a uniform size distribution and spherical shape. The in vitro release from LH-SLNs followed the Higuchi model. The ex vivo permeability study demonstrated enhanced drug permeation from LH-SLNs (>90%) through rat intestine as compared to LH-suspension. The SLNs were found to be taken up by energy dependent, endocytic mechanism which was mediated by clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis across Caco-2 cell line. The pharmacokinetic results showed that oral bioavailability of LH was improved over 5.16-fold after incorporation into SLNs as compared to LH-suspension.

Between October 2012 and February 2015, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a German chemical company. Using the ""Munich ChronoType Questionnaire"" (MCTQ), data about sleep onset and sleep offset during workdays and work-free days were retrieved and the chronotype was computed during regular voluntary occupational health check-ups. Associations between age and chronotype, as well as sleep duration, were assessed using linear regression analyses. Potential effect modification by the working time system was examined. Within the study period, 4,040 employees (82.3% and 17.7% were engaged in day work and rotating shift work, respectively) completed the questionnaire. Study participants were on average 41.8 years old (Min = 18.0, Max = 65.0, SD = 10.2) and predominantly male (75.4%). Mean chronotype and overall sleep duration was 03:22 (SD = 54 min) and 7.2 h (SD = 1.0 h) respectively. Older age was associated with earlier chronotype and reduced overall sleep duration in both day workers and rotating shift workers (p < 0.001 for all models). Compared to day workers, employees whom engaged in rotating shift work were later chronotypes and had overall a longer sleep duration. With older age, the difference between day and rotating shift workers regarding chronotype increased, while the difference regarding overall sleep duration decreased (pinteraction<0.005 for both models). This finding could indicate that both changes in circadian physiology and exposure to certain work schedules contribute to the age-related changes. Older rotating shift workers, with early chronotypes may have issues with night shifts, while day work and morning shifts may be best compatible to earlier chronotypes. Differences in sleep timing across age groups, might indicate that the same work hours will affect shift workers differently, dependent on their age, suggesting that more flexible and chronotype-adapted work hours could provide useful; especially for older employees. Sleep education in the form of courses and health campaigns could be a way to raise awareness of the importance of a healthy sleep pattern. This could be achieved by learning strategies to better adjust individual sleep patterns to work hours.",Th.

In this study 370 participants from Australia and Canada completed a survey that included a 'willingness to communicate with health professionals' scale. They also commented on their use and trust of Internet health information. Thematic analysis suggests that patients' use of Internet health information serves as a broker between patients and their health provider in health consultations. We discuss the implications of these findings for health practitioners as they address how easier Internet access influences patient interactions with health professionals.

Tumour microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in tumour development and drug resistance. To address this problem, we constructed a novel anti-tumour nanoparticle platform RBC@BPQDs-DOX/KIR, black phosphorus nanoparticle quantum dots (BPQDs) with one of the chemotherapeutics (doxorubicin, DOX) and an anti-inflammatory traditional Chinese medicine active component (Kirenol, KIR). Red blood cell membrane (RBCm) vesicles were used as the shell to envelop several nanocores. The combination of DOX and KIR may promote therapeutic efficacy, at which the anti-apoptotic effect of the tumour cells was inhibited (by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax) and the tumour progression-related inflammatory factors, such as tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were downregulated. Furthermore, TME was remodelled and the anti-tumour effect of DOX was magnified. RBCm imparts high biocompatibility and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects to RBC@BPQDs-DOX/KIR, thus enhancing its tumour passively targetability.

However, the best parameter for expressing the 13C-KICA BT result is uncertain which hinders use of the BT in routine clinical practice. We have investigated the repeatability of different parameters of 13C-KICA BT. Thirteen healthy adult subjects (5 men and 8 women) underwent a 13C-KICA BT on two occasions separated by a gap of approximately 30 days. There were no significant differences between the repeated measurements for all the test parameters over 30 days. Furthermore, the Bland Altman statistics showed no fixed or proportional bias for any of the test parameters. The cumulative 13C-dose enrichment over 60 min had the lowest within-subject variability of 12% compared to all other test parameters.

In the past years, this technique has been mainly used to confirm the malignant nature of undetermined pulmonary lesions; however, today its role has been completely renewed. With the advent of target therapy and immunotherapy, it has arisen for lung cancer, in inoperable patients, the necessity to obtain adequate bioptical material to perform a correct molecular characterization of the lesion. Moreover, the possibility of acquired drug-resistance mechanisms makes it necessary in some cases to rebiopsy these lesions over time. For these reasons, it is likely that the request of computed tomography-guided lung biopsy will increase in the future, therefore every radiologist should be confident with its most important aspects."

Introduction:
 Public awareness regarding the influence of diet on kidney stones is unknown. We sought to evaluate such perceptions among an unselected community cohort. 
Materials and Methods:
 A survey was created to assess perception of beverages/foods on risk of kidney stone formation. Surveys were distributed to attendees of a State Fair. Participants were categorized to determine the effect of stone history on prevention knowledge (no prior stone vs prior stone). 
Results:
 Seven hundred fifty-three participants completed the survey, including 264 (35%) with a prior stone. Participants with prior stones were less likely to believe stones were preventable compared to those without (56% vs 65%, p = 0.01). Appropriate perceptions regarding influence of diet on stones were highest for water (>90% of participants) and cola/salt/red meat (>50%). Fewer than half of respondents correctly identified the influence of the remaining 14 substances. On multivariable analysis, stone formers were more likely to correctly identify the influence of lemonade (odds ratio [OR] 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-3.31), nuts (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.60-4.23), and spinach (OR 5.06; 95% CI 2.89-8.86), but less likely to identify the influence of coffee (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.82) and red meat (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.23-0.59). 
Conclusion:
 Patients with prior stones hold different attitudes regarding the influence of certain foods and drinks on stone formation relative to the public. Such attitudes are not always correct, and as a group they are less likely to believe in dietary stone prevention. Such findings may indicate confusion among stone formers and highlight an opportunity for improved dietary counseling.",Themes Depicted in Running-Related Films: An Opportunity for Co-Viewing and Active Mediation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880444,Clinical pediatrics,2019 05 08,"Sport participation is an important part of the development of children and adolescents. The objective of this study was to identify and quantify themes depicted in a select number of running-related films.

However, the vapor phase and volatile components present in EOs have not been thoroughly investigated; there are a small number of published reports on the antimicrobial activity of some EOs and a few of their components against selected microorganisms. It is well known that the antimicrobial activity of EOs depends mainly on their chemical composition. It is also important; however, to understand the volatility of these compounds as well as the methodologies used to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of their vapor phase. This review focuses on recent research regarding the chemical composition of EOs, their biological activity and mechanisms of action, the antimicrobial activity of EOs in the vapor phase, the different techniques that have been proposed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of EOs in the vapor phase, and actual and potential applications of EOs in the vapor phase.

The results showed that the five-factor structure with 20 facets replicated well across cultures with a total congruence coefficient of .97. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) resulted in adequate fit indices for the five factors based on the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; >.90), and RMSEA (.031-.081). A series of CFA to assess measurement invariance across cultures resulted in adequate CFIs and TLIs for configural and metric invariance. However, factors did not show scalar invariance. Alpha internal consistencies of five factors ranged between .77 (Sensation Seeking) and .86 (Neuroticism). The average alpha of the 20 facets was .64 with a range from .43 (SS4) to .75 (AG1). Nevertheless, alpha reliabilities were lower in some facets and cultures, especially for Senegal and Togo. The average percentage of the variance explained based on the adjusted R2 was 2.9%, 1.7%, and 5.1% for age, sex, and, cultures, respectively. Finally, multidimensional scaling suggested that geographically or culturally close cultures share mean profile similarities.",Association Between Fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Spontaneous Fluctuation and Degree Centrality in Children and Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880423,Brain connectivity,2019 06 10,"The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) of the BOLD signal have been successfully applied as exploratory tools in neuroimaging. This metric has been useful in mapping brain functional changes in many clinical populations. However, little is known about the neurophysiological correlates of fALFF. This study aimed at demonstrating that fALFF is related to local network centrality during childhood and adolescence. The establishment of this relationship is fundamental to provide a more meaningful explanation to previous clinical and neurodevelopmental studies based on fALFF. Our findings show a correlation of ∼0.5 between these two metrics at a group level, which is a finding replicated in four large independent samples. However, when considering the across-subject and intra-subject correlations between the two metrics, the correlation is much lower, probably due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, we found that regions with high fALFF and degree centrality overlapped modestly, particularly the posterior cingulate/precuneus and lateral parietal cortices.",The Secret Life of Secrets: Deleterious Psychosomatic Effects on Patient and Analyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880422,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,2019 03 18,"The impact and complex nature of keeping secrets deserves greater scrutiny within psychoanalysis. While the capacity to keep a secret is a developmental achievement that furthers conscious choice and healthy boundary setting between self and others, an individual's need for privacy must be distinguished from untoward costs of collusion and concealment. Clinical case material shows that not all secrets are unconscious or multilayered, as assumed in most of the psychoanalytic literature. Nonetheless, in these cases deleterious effects to psyche and soma took root. These patients assumed that their secret was irreparably destructive to an essential object relationship; shame, guilt, narcissistic vulnerability, unconscious identification with an injured party, and developmental deficit were other factors found to undergird this mode of pathogenic dissembling. Two clinical examples also demonstrate that embodied countertransference reactions may herald the revelation of a secret in treatment that had been hidden, but in plain view. Secrets appear to exert their profound psychological and physical effects on patient and analyst by biological mechanisms that are as yet poorly understood but are readily observed in clinical practice. Psychoanalysts who keep in conscious awareness both the adaptive value and the potential costs of maintaining the confidences of others over the course of a career are better positioned to assist their patients and themselves in rendering essential self-care.",Writing Gender with Sexuality: Reflections on the Diaries of Lou Sullivan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880421,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,2019 03 18,"In contemporary psychoanalytic writing, gender tends to be disarticulated from sexuality. While this has been a theoretically useful approach, especially as regards the critical appraisal of early traditional literature (which often assumed a facile coherence between sex, sexuality, and gender), this position too often leaves gender stripped of one of the most compelling forces in psychoanalytic theorizing, namely, its relation to the sexual. Here the diaries of Lou Sullivan (1951-1991)-a transsexual man who began writing long before considering sexual transitioning-are used to present an extended example of the intimate linkage between gender and sexuality. The diaries stand as a unique historical archive: a fairly comprehensive, prospective, first-person account of transsexuality, begun before the subject self-identified as transsexual, which documents a complex and candid subjective evolution. Situated historically during a time of enormous upheaval in both psychoanalysis and the culture at large on questions of gender and sexuality, the diaries offer an additional opportunity to consider the nexus of individual psyche and social forms.","""The Skin is the Cradle of the Soul"": Didier Anzieu on the Skin-Ego, Boundaries, and Boundlessness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880417,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,2019 03 18,"Didier Anzieu's notion of the skin-ego builds on a long psychoanalytic tradition that began with Freud's idea that the ego is first and foremost a body ego, a projection in the psyche of the surface of the body, or, in other words, the idea that psychic phenomena are always embodied. An interface, a container for the ego, but also its origin: thus did Anzieu conceptualize the skin's psychic function. The baby's fantasy of having a common skin with the mother is the concrete starting point for a development that, through the prohibition on touching, leads to the experience of being a separate and individual person. Psychoanalytic work with severe mental disorders makes it necessary to investigate deficiencies in the skin-ego's containing function before the patient's psychic contents can be explored. In the psychoanalytic situation, the analyst's words replace tactile contact and thereby contribute to healing injuries to the skin-ego. The clinical implications of Anzieu's theoretical model are illustrated by examples from psychoanalyses of children and adults. The close connection between touch, psychic envelopes, and thinking opens a wider perspective on the necessity of setting limits to violence, against both nature and human beings.",On the Natal Body and Its Confusing Place in Mental Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880415,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,2019 03 18,"These reflections concern ongoing confusions in holding together the gestalt of the natal body, sex, gender, and procreation. Highlighting theoretical confusions is the shifting history of relations among the material body, the ""psychoanalytic body,"":sex, and gender. Studying these confusions and collecting more data may help the field advance where a rush to theoretical foreclosure will not. Observe, for example, how commonly foreclosing are the terms ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" when automatically applied to the merely biological attributes of a sexed body. More confusions arise from theorizing gender identity using split-off images of body parts divorced from any natal referent. In a published clinical case, for instance, the role of the procreative body is characteristically ignored in gender theorizing. Apparently unspeakable horrors of the female body come with its birthing potential and may be a motive for erasure. Julia Kristeva, an exemplary writer, accepts simultaneously a sexed, procreative, and gendered layering in the mind. Her account of the ""abject"" can shed light on the suppressive horror in our field, which remains almost silent on the body's procreative potential in everyday life. By contrast, even Ice Age sculptors were engaged with procreative female bodies.",The Half Embrace of Psychic Bisexuality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880410,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,2019 03 18,"The discourse on psychic bisexuality is explored as it unfolds in Freud's writings, in contemporary papers by LGBTQ psychoanalysts, and in a volume of essays, Psychic Bisexuality, published in 2018 by a group of prominent French and British analysts (Perelberg 2018). The greater acceptance of nonnormative sexualities and genders is reshaping the discourse on bisexuality and gender in many corners of our profession, yet, as the Perelberg volume attests, that evolution is far from universal. A strain of unquestioned heteronormativity and cisgenderism is evident in Perelberg et al.'s description of the fundamentals of psychic life, a strain that has roots (via a certain one-sided reading of Lacan) in Freud's unresolved mourning of his inchoate homosexual self. A more embracing vision of bisexuality would seek to ""hold,"" rather than enact, the grief and anxiety associated with the development of myriad diverse personal patterns.","The effects of psyllium supplementation on body weight, body mass index and waist circumference in adults: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880409,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 03 18,"Previous studies reported inconsistent findings regarding the effects of psyllium supplementation on obesity measures.

In the absence of halide anions, the free cage assumes a flattened conformation: the cavity is compressed along the C3 axis passing through the tertiary amines, and the two tribenzylamine platforms are eclipsed. Halide encapsulation promotes a large conformational rearrangement of the cage, involving an extension of the cavity along the C3 axis and shrinkage along the equatorial plane. Interestingly, the rearrangement is accompanied by the pyramidal inversion of the tertiary amines and by the rotation of the tribenzylamine-based platforms, which become staggered. The imidazolium-containing arms wrap around the spherical anion, leading to a racemic mixture of the M and P helical complexes. As expected from the flexible structure of the cage, the switch between the two limit conformations can be repeated for several cycles under alternating chemical stimuli (AgNO3/TBACl). This result is consistent with the low activation barriers determined by computational investigations. These also allowed us to quantify the energy difference between the shrunk and expanded cage conformations and to hypothesize an energetic pathway along which the conformational rearrangement can occur.",Efficient Conversion of CO2 via Grafting Urea Group into a [Cu2(COO)4]-Based Metal-Organic Framework with Hierarchical Porosity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880391,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 01,"The assembly of mixed [1,1';3',1'']terphenyl-4,5',4''-tricarboxylic acid (H3TPTC) and [1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC), 2,2'-diamino-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC-NH2), or 6-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[ d, f][1,3]diazepine-3,9-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC-Urea) with Cu2+ ion generated the corresponding copper-paddlewheel-based metal-organic framework (MOF) [Cu5(TPTC)3(BPDC)0.5(H2O)5] (1), [Cu5(TPTC)3(BPDC-NH2)0.5(H2O)5] (1-NH2), or [Cu5(TPTC)3(BPDC-Urea)0.5(H2O)5] (1-Urea).

Taking advantages of biocompatible, transparent, compact properties of PS shell, the coated tags showed satisfactory sensitivity, biocompatibility, and superior structural stability in cell and in vivo imaging applications. More importantly, the PS coating strategy allowed for the encapsulation of SERS tags encoded with not only thiolated but also nonthiolated Raman reporters without loss of sensitivity, as exemplified in the synthesis of 9 different resonant dye-encoded tags. Moreover, the coating of SERS tags with various kinds of substrates was achieved via the same standard protocol. Comparing with widespread silica coated tags, the PS coated ones were more stable in harsh conditions and had an easily expanded ultrasensitive (resonant) tags library with much lower cost (no need of expensive sulfhydryl/isothiocyano reporters with limited types), illustrating great promise as standard analytical tools of commercialized value for bioanalysis, medical diagnostics, and environmental science studies.",Extremely Low-Cost and Green Cellulose Passivating Perovskites for Stable and High-Performance Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880387,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"The fast evolution of metal halide perovskite solar cells has opened a new chapter in the field of renewable energy. High-quality perovskite films as the active layers are essential for both high efficiency and long-term stability. Here, the perovskite films with enlarged crystal grain size and decreased defect density are fabricated by introducing the extremely low-cost and green polymer, ethyl cellulose (EC), into the perovskite layer. The addition of EC triggers hydrogen bonding interactions between EC and the perovskite, passivating the charge defect traps at the grain boundaries. The long chain of EC further acts as a scaffold for the perovskite structure, eliminating the annealing-induced lattice strain during the film fabrication process. The resulting devices with the EC additive exhibit a remarkably enhanced average power conversion efficiency from 17.11 to 19.27% and an improvement of all device parameters. The hysteresis index is found to decrease by three times from 0.081 to 0.027, which is attributed to suppressed ion migration and surface charge trapping. In addition, the defect passivation by EC significantly improves the environmental stability of the perovskite films, yielding devices that retain 80% of their initial efficiency after 30 days in ambient air at 45% relative humidity, whereas the pristine devices without EC fully degrade. This work provides a low-cost and green avenue for passivating defects that improves both the efficiency and operational stability of perovskite solar cells.","Rapid Fabrication of Noniridescent Structural Color Coatings with High Color Visibility, Good Structural Stability, and Self-Healing Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880386,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 05,"Artificial construction of amorphous photonic structures (APSs) is an important approach for obtaining noniridescent structural colors and shows a great potential for practical applications in paints, textile coloring, display, or other color-related fields. However, the structural colors are usually dim because of the influence of incoherent scattering, and the point contact among the microspheres leads to poor structural stability. This paper presents an innovative strategy for constructing noniridescent structural color coatings with high color visibility, good structural stability, and self-healing properties by combining APSs with polymers. Color visibility is significantly improved without the addition of black light-absorbing substances because of the inherent properties of polysulfide microspheres. At the same time, the introduction of waterborne polyurea in the system enhanced the structural stability and imparted the self-healing properties. The prepared coatings can be applied to various substrates and even to the coloration of soft fabrics, which not only achieves excellent performance but can also be easily patterned on the bulk scale.",Cerium-Oxide-Modified Anodes for Efficient and UV-Stable ZnO-Based Perovskite Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880385,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"CeO x has been widely used in optoelectronic devices due to its special electronic and optical structure.

The incorporation of CeO x can regulate the chemical compatibility between ZnO and perovskite, unmatched energy levels, and poor UV stability, further enhancing the cell performance and stability of PSCs. As expected, the best efficiency of fabricated CH3NH3PbI3-PSCs based on ZnO/CeO x as the ETM was up to 19.5%. In contrast, the efficiency of PSCs with pure ZnO was 16.0%. Moreover, compared with PSCs based on ZnO, ZnO/CeO x-based PSCs exhibited significantly enhanced moisture, and thermal and UV stability.

The turn on voltage and EL intensity are strongly dependent on the concentration of metal clusters. It is shown that the key to optimize this technology is improving the zeolite anode contact. Such an optimized device based on cheap abundant materials could provide an alternative for the commercial phosphor converted LEDs. A ZEOLED with a voltage polarity dependent color is demonstrated."

Measurement of electromotive force between sensing and reference electrodes provided various electrochemical properties of pH sensors. The pH sensor show excellent sensor performances of sensitivity of 62.4 mV/pH, repeatability of 97.9% retention, response time of 12.8 s, and durability of 3.0 mV/h. The pH sensor could also measure pH changes as the milk is spoiled, which is similar to those of a commercial pH meter. The pH sensors were highly flexible, and thus can measure the fruit decay on the curved surface of an apple.

In a great majority of cases, indeed, migraine symptoms spontaneously improve throughout pregnancy. Generally, migraine without aura (MO) improves better than migraine with aura (MA), which can occur ex novo in pregnancy more frequently than MO. After childbirth, the recurrence rate of migraine attacks increases, especially during the first month; breastfeeding exerts a protective effect against the reappearance of attacks. Migraine and pregnancy share a condition of hypercoagulability; therefore, attention must be paid to the risk of cardiovascular disorders, like venous thromboembolism and ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Some of these diseases can be linked to preeclampsia (PE), a serious complication of pregnancy, characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, or other findings of organ failure. This condition is more common in migraineurs compared with non-migraineurs; furthermore, women whose migraines worsen during pregnancy had a 13-fold higher risk of hypertensive disorders than those in which migraine remitted or improved. Pregnancy is generally recognized to exert a beneficial effect on migraine; nonetheless, clinicians should be on the alert for possible cardiovascular complications that appear to be more frequent in this patient population."

For the particular CE-SDS application, this phenomenon was manifested through peak migration time shifts and sliding of the superimposed baseline profile. These dual phenomena are closely associated so that experimental assessment alone may not shed enough light to the underlying drivers. In the current study, both experimental and simulation approaches were employed to assess the systematic drifts. Computer simulation was used to decipher the two underlying factors and test their contributions toward purity and impurity peak determination inaccuracies. The data generated in this study demonstrated that the electrophoretic baseline disturbance had more pronounced impact on the purity data than the migration time shift. In addition, the potential contributing factors to the baseline disturbances were assessed experimentally which indicated that the source is related to thermal disruption during a sample run and the unique baseline patterns came from the background electrolytes. To improve data reproducibility for drug purity testing in the industrial setting and quality control (QC) environment, it is recommended to run shorter injection sequences including fewer samples and closely monitor the baseline drift for accurate integration. Those methods would help reduce the impact of systematic drift and disturbances.

This biosensor is also suitable for use in the routine pharmaceutical practice. To prove this statement, two different commercially available pharmaceutical formulations were analyzed. This nano-(bio)electroanalytical device was made from a commercially available screen-printed carbon electrode covered by a thin layer of non-functionalized graphene (NFG) as amperometric transducer. A biorecognition layer was prepared from mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) cross-linked using glutaraldehyde, where resulting aggregates were covered by Nafion®, a known ion exchange membrane. Owing to the use of tyrosinase and presence of NFG, the developed analytical instrument is able to measure even at potentials of 0 V. Linear ranges differ according to choice of detection potential, namely up to 130 μmol L-1 at 0 V, up to 90 μmol L-1 at -0.1 V, and up to 70 μmol L-1 at -0.15 V. The first mentioned linear range is described by the equation Ip [μA] = 0.236 - 0.1984c [μmol L-1] and correlation coefficient r = 0.9987; this equation was used to quantify the content of APAP in each sample. The limit of detection of APAP was estimated to be 1.1 μmol L-1. A recovery of 96.8% (c = 25 μmol L-1, n = 5 measurements) was calculated. The obtained results show that FIA is a very selective method for APAP determination, being comparable to the chosen reference method of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.",Fuelling on the wing: sensory ecology of hawkmoth foraging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880349,"Journal of comparative physiology. A, Neuroethology, sensory, neural, and behavioral physiology",2019 03 18,"Hawkmoths (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) comprise around 1500 species, most of which forage on nectar from flowers in their adult stage, usually while hovering in front of the flower. The majority of species have a nocturnal lifestyle and are important nocturnal pollinators, but some species have turned to a diurnal lifestyle. Hawkmoths use visual and olfactory cues including CO2 and humidity to detect and recognise rewarding flowers; they find the nectary in the flowers by means of mechanoreceptors on the proboscis and vision, evaluate it with gustatory receptors on the proboscis, and control their hovering flight position using antennal mechanoreception and vision. Here, we review what is presently known about the sensory organs and sensory-guided behaviour that control feeding behaviour of this fascinating pollinator taxon. We also suggest that more experiments on hawkmoth behaviour in natural settings are needed to fully appreciate their sensory capabilities.",Restoration of periventricular vasculature after direct bypass for moyamoya disease: intra-individual comparison.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880348,Acta neurochirurgica,2019 04 26,"While periventricular anastomosis, a unique abnormal vasculature in moyamoya disease, has been studied in relation to intracranial hemorrhage, no study has addressed its change after bypass surgery.

The phages Dev-CD-23823 and Dev-CT57 possessed broad host specificity, as they infected 88% and 80% of the Cronobacter strains tested. Genome sequence comparisons of phages Dev-CD-23823 and Dev-CT57 showed different levels of similarity to the prototype GAP227 phage. The Dev-CT57 phage was highly similar, whereas the Dev-CD-23823 phage showed only 75% sequence identity. A phylogenic tree based on the RNA polymerase (RNAP) gene from selected representatives of the subfamily Autographivirinae confirmed the grouping of Dev-CD-23823, Dev-CT57 and GAP227 in one cluster together with phages PP2, Phi80-18 and PhiR8-01. A common conserved motif was also detected in the RNAP promoters of these phages. The functional activity of these RNAP promoters was confirmed experimentally using a promoter probe vector, and a phage-specific signal was observed; however, some cross-specificity of Dev-CD-23823 and Dev-CT57 promoters was also detected.

One hundred fifty-three nursing homes performed the conferences. The outcome was the amount of EOL care provided in nursing homes after adjusting for the facility beds in 2014. We investigated the factors of staff experience with EOL care, frequency of the conferences, years the conferences were conducted, review conferences after EOL care, and professional participants in the conferences. The multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between EOL care in nursing homes and nurses' experience with EOL care (adjusted β coefficient 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 ~ 5.22, p = 0.017), more than 5 years of continuous conferences (adjusted β coefficient 3.8, 95% CI 0.46 ~ 7.05, p = 0.026), and family participation (adjusted βcoefficient ‒4.0, 95% CI ‒7.5 ~ ‒0.48, p = 0.026). In conclusion, the continuation of conferences and enrollment of the nurse with experience in EOL care may promote EOL care in nursing homes, while family enrollment in conferences may decrease EOL care in nursing homes.

The patients received either CoQ10 100 mg three times a day or no CoQ10 in addition to routine treatment for 30 days. Echocardiographic study was performed at baseline and follow-up. LV diastolic function was evaluated by two dimensional and Doppler echocardiography as follows; average E/e׳, septal and lateral e׳velocity, and left atrium volume index (LAVI). A total of 28 patients completed the study. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the CoQ10 treatment group in terms between groups (∆E/e׳ ‒ 3.6 vs. ‒ 2.4; p = 0.28) and (∆LAVI ‒ 5.4 vs. ‒ 4.4; p = 0.83). Short term CoQ10 supplementation provided no additional benefits in improving LV diastolic function in patients with HFpEF.",Raised neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and serum beta hCG level in early second trimester of pregnancy as predictors for development and severity of preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880320,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,2019 03 18,"Early detection and prediction of preeclampsia (PE) may avert serious materno-fetal complications. This prospective nested study was conducted to evaluate the role of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting the development and severity of PE. Four hundred and forty primigravidas, between 16 to 18 weeks of gestation, were recruited in the study. Serum beta-hCG and NLR were measured at the time of recruitment and they were followed and monitored for the development of PE and severe PE. Out of these 440 women, 64 (14%) developed PE; of which 25 (39%) developed severe PE. The mean values of NLR and serum beta hCG were significantly higher in patients developing PE and severe PE. NLR, with a cutoff value of 5.6, predicted the development of PE with 73.4% sensitivity and 88.6% specificity and severe PE with sensitivity 93.3% and specificity 86.6% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of serum beta hCG in predicting the development of PE was 75% each for a cutoff value of 25,415 IU/mL whereas these values were 86.7%, and 79.1% respectively, for a cut-off value of 29,654 IU/mL for predicting the development of severe PE. These findings suggest that NLR and serum beta hCG can be used as excellent biomarkers in predicting both the development of PE and its severity. Multicentric studies involving subjects of multiple ethnicities should be done for establishing its utility as a routine screening test.",Synergistic anti-candida activities of lactoferrin and the lactoperoxidase system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880319,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,2019 03 18,"Candida albicans is a commensal fungus in human mucosal surfaces, including the oral cavity. Lactoferrin (LF) and the lactoperoxidase (LPO) system, which are host protection components in exocrine secretions, each exhibit weak anti-candida activity. We herein examined the effects of the combination of LF and the LPO system on C. albicans. Morphological observations indicated that the combination of LF and the LPO system reduced the mycelial volume of C. albicans and changed the size and shape of cells more than each agent alone. The combination of LF and the LPO system also exerted strong inhibitory effects on the cellular metabolic activity and adhesive hyphal form of C. albicans. A checkerboard analysis revealed that the anti-candida activity of LF and the LPO system was synergistic. These results suggest that the combination of LF and the LPO system is useful for preventing candidiasis.",Study of correlation of level of expression of Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors sclerostin and dickkopf-1 with disease activity and severity in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880318,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,2019 03 18,"This study was done with aim to assess the serum sclerostin and dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) level in patients of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to correlate their level with disease activity and bone mineral density. Fifty patients of RA and equal age and sex matched healthy controls were included in the study. Patients were evaluated clinically and investigated with routine blood tests along with rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibody (anti-CCP2), radiographs and bone mineral density (BMD). Serum sclerostin and DKK-1 levels of both cases and controls was assayed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay [RayBio®, Georgia, USA with coefficient of variation percent (CV %), < 10%] and compared with disease activity and bone mineral density. Disease activity was measured by Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) along with Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) score. Mean serum sclerostin and DKK-1 was significantly higher in study group as compared to control group. Serum sclerostin showed significant correlation with disease activity scores (DAS score and MHAQ score), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Serum sclerostin at level of 394 pg/mL was found to have diagnostic significance with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%. DKK-1 level shows significantly positive correlation with larson score which denotes radiological progression (r value 0.468; p value 0.001). More studies with larger sample size of RA patients are needed for better determination of the role of sclerostin and DKK-1 in RA. Also, the correlation of these and other bone turn over markers will help decipher their role with disease progression in RA patients.",A new method to evaluate the enzyme-suppressing activity of a leucine aminopeptidase 3 inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880317,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,2019 03 18,"The expression of leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP3) is associated with the prognosis for and malignant transformation of many types of tumors. Therefore, a LAP3 inhibitor may represent a new strategy for cancer therapy. Evaluating the suppression of enzyme activity by an LAP3 inhibitor is essential. Right now, leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) purified from the porcine kidneys are the only enzymes that can be used to evaluate the suppression of enzyme activity by an LAP3 inhibitor. This approach cannot accurately reflect the suppression of human LAP3 by an inhibitor. The current study developed a new method with which to evaluate the suppression of enzyme activity by an LAP3 inhibitor. Total protein from K562 cells seldom catalyzed the LAP3 substrate. A lentivirus was used to induce K562 cells to overexpress LAP3 (K562-LAP3). After puromycin screening, flow cytometry data indicated that 98.8% of cells expressed green fluorescent protein. The expression of LAP3 in K562-LAP3 cells was also assessed using Western blotting. K562-LAP3 cells were lysed with ultrasonication. Total protein was used as an enzyme source and L-leucine p-nitroaniline hydrochloride was used as a substrate to measure enzyme activity. Total protein from K562-LAP3 cells catalyzed the substrate more than that from K562 cells did. The LAP3 inhibitor ubenimex was used as a positive control to evaluate the suppression of LAP3 enzyme activity. Results indicated that ubenimex significantly inhibited the enzyme activity of LAP3. This approach provides a convenient and accurate way to evaluate the suppression of enzyme activity by an LAP3 inhibitor.",Low-concentration Sorbic Acid Promotes the Induction of Escherichia coli into a Viable but Nonculturable State.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880315,Biocontrol science,2019 03 18,"　The effect of food preservatives and sanitizers at low concentrations on the induction of Escherichia coli into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state was investigated. When E. coli was incubated in physiological saline at 37℃, the viable cell count measured by plate counting was approximately 3-logs lower than that measured by flow cytometry after 30 days. This difference, and morphological changes in cells, confirmed the transition of E. coli into a VBNC state. Adding 10 μg/l of sorbic acid significantly promoted the induction of E. coli into a VBNC state. This effect was not seen with benzoic acid or sodium hypochlorite at the same concentration. Resuscitation of E. coli VBNC cells was successful when they were grown in nutrient broth containing sodium pyruvate. These results suggest that the presence of low concentrations of food additives in a food manufacturing environment may act as potential triggers for bacterial VBNC induction.",Construction of Its Evaluation System in Originally Designed Test-Chamber System and Sporicidal Activity of Aerosolized Hypochlorite Solution to Bacillus subtilis Spores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880314,Biocontrol science,2019 03 18,"　Effective spatial disinfection systems are required for human health care, public hygiene, and food and medicine manufacturing. Although some aerosolized disinfectants were already applied to its purpose, accurate evaluation systems were under constructed. In this study, the spatial sporicidal activity of aerosolized hypochlorite solution (AHS) to dormant cells, Bacillus subtilis spores, was evaluated by an originally designed chamber system. In the test-chamber, AHS was supplied and existed as micro-droplets, and environmental relative humidity (RH) could be controlled. Available chlorine (AC) exposure was also controlled with appropriate AC loading but was influenced by the acidity of AHS. Our results indicated that inactivation of spore was depend on AC exposure amount and time. On the other hand, unsaturated environmental RH markedly decreased spore inactivation. This study indicated that our test-chamber system can provide reproducible test data under a homogeneous air condition, and, thereby, that the data obtained by the chamber system should contribute to predicting the AC-required dose to disinfect a whole building.",Solid-liquid Interface Screening SystemーApplication to the Screening of Antibiotic and Cytotoxic Substance-producing Fungi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880313,Biocontrol science,2019 03 18,"　A useful tool for the screening of fungi producing biologically active secondary metabolites such as antibiotics and cytotoxic substances has been developed. An agar plate-organic solvent interface cultivation (A/S-IFC) system, which comprised a hydrophobic organic solvent (upper phase) , a fungal mat (middle phase) and an agar plate (lower phase) , was constructed. The metabolite profiles were compared among the A/S-IFC, a traditional submerged cultivation (SmC) and an extractive liquid surface immobilization (Ext-LSI) system consisted of a hydrophobic solvent (upper phase) , a fungal cells-ballooned microspheres (middle phase) and a liquid medium (lower phase) , with high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) . In the A/S-IFC, many hydrophobic metabolites vastly different from those in the SmC were accumulated in the organic phase as with the Ext-LSI. For example, a valuable azaphilone, sclerotiorin, was remarkably produced into the organic phase in the A/S-IFC. The A/S-IFC was applied to the screening of antibiotic-producing fungi. As a result of paper disk method, it was found that 321 isolated among 811 strains produced antifungal metabolites (hit rate, 39.6%) . Furthermore, 8, 23, and 30 strains also produced cytotoxic metabolites against SKOV-3 (human ovary adenocarcinoma) , MESO-1 (human malignant pleural mesothelioma) , and Jurkat cells (immortalized human T lymphocyte) ."

The patient was a 53-year-old woman who presented with the chief complaint of gingival swelling and tooth mobility in the right maxillary molar region. An initial examination revealed 36% of sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm and 15.5% with bleeding on probing. Radiographic examination revealed vertical bone resorption in #15, 24, 27, 34, 37, 45, and 47. Horizontal resorption was noted in other regions. The clinical diagnosis was moderate chronic periodontitis. Initial periodontal therapy consisted of plaque control, scaling, and root planing together with treatment for caries. Occlusal adjustment of premature contact sites was performed after suppression of inflammation. Periodontal regenerative therapy using enamel matrix derivative was performed on #15, 24, 34, 45, and 47. Other sites with residual periodontal pockets were treated by open flap debridement. Tooth #27 was extracted due to a bone defect exceeding the root apex; #37 was extracted due to frequent acute symptoms following periodontal surgery. Following re-evaluation, the patient was placed on supportive periodontal therapy. Periodontal regenerative therapy improved vertical bone resorption. This improvement has been adequately maintained over a 3 years 6 months period. Additional care is necessary, however, to further improve the patient's oral health-related quality of life during supportive periodontal therapy.",Intra- and Inter-Investigator Reliability of Measurement of Lip-Seal Strength in Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880298,The Bulletin of Tokyo Dental College,2019 03 18,"The purpose of this methodological study was to clarify intra- and inter-investigator reliability of lip-seal strength measurement in adults. Lip-seal strength was measured with a digital medical strain gauge using the button-pull method. The coefficient of variation (CV) of intra-investigator reliability of measurement in 24 healthy adult volunteers (16 men, 8 women; mean age, 26±3 years) ranged from 0.088 to 0.103 (mean for 3 investigators, 0.098). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC [1,1]) of intra-investigator reliability of this method of lip-seal strength measurement ranged from 0.759 to 0.832 (mean, 0.804). The ICC (2,1) of inter-investigator reliability of the measured values was 0.737. The CV of intra-investigator reliability of lip-seal strength measurement by a single investigator in 54 adult patients (14 men, 40 women; mean age, 49±16 years) was 0.072. The ICC (1,1) of intra-investigator reliability of this measurement method of lip-seal strength was 0.863. A CV of approximately 0.2 or lower is considered to indicate excellent agreement; an ICC of approximately 0.75 or higher is considered indicative of good reliability. These results demonstrate that measurement of lip-seal strength in adults with this device offers sufficient intra- and inter-investigator reliability.",Periodontal Regenerative Therapy Using Enamel Matrix Derivative for Treatment of Generalized Severe Chronic Periodontitis: A 2-year Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880297,The Bulletin of Tokyo Dental College,2019 03 18,"Here, we describe the treatment course and 2-year follow-up in a case of multiple deep intrabony defects treated with periodontal regenerative therapy.

Although blunt cerebrovascular injury is a common cause of cerebral ischemia, its management is still controversial. We describe a 23-year-old man in previously good health who developed three-vessel cervical arterial dissections due to blunt trauma. He was admitted to our emergency and critical care center after a motor vehicle crash. Computed tomography showed a thin, acute subdural hematoma in the right hemisphere and fractures of the odontoid process (Anderson type III), pelvis, and extremities. He was treated conservatively, and about 1 month later, he developed bleariness. Computed tomography angiography showed bilateral internal carotid and left vertebral artery dissection. Aspirin therapy was started immediately, and then clopidogrel was added to the regimen. Two weeks later, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed improved blood flow of the vessels. Only aspirin therapy was continued. About 3 months after discharge, MRA demonstrated further improvement of the blood flow of both internal carotid arteries, but the dissection flap on the right side remained. Therefore, we extended the duration of antiplatelet therapy. On the basis of our experience with this case, we think that antithrombotic therapy is crucial for the management of multi-vessel cervical arterial injury, and agents should be used properly according to the injury grade and phase; however, further study is needed to confirm this recommendation.",Reducing the gender gap in academic activities: a 10-year progress report by the Japan Endocrine Society Women Endocrinologists Association (JES-We-Can).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880294,Endocrine journal,2019 04 25,"The Japan Endocrine Society (JES) has the largest ratio of female membership among societies associated with Internal Medicine in Japan; half of female members are in their 20s or 30s at present. In 2009, JES organized the ""JES-We-Can"" committee to promote women's career development. To evaluate the effectiveness of JES-We-Can, we investigated the gender balance of various activities at JES in fiscal 2009 and 2017. Significant gender-differences were not observed in the acquisition rate of board-certified endocrinologists (BCEs) aged <40 y in 2009 and 2017. However, the acquisition rate of BCEs among women aged ≥40 y was significantly lower than men in 2009. In 2017, the gender-difference among BCEs in this group (currently aged ≥50 y) has considerably improved, but is not resolved. The acquisition rate of certificated endocrine educators (CEEs) among women was still significantly lower than men at all ages in 2017. Since the ratio of women oral speakers or poster presenters at annual academic meetings have grown to equal or surpass the membership ratio, female members make efficient contributions to JES. The numbers of women chairpersons, symposiasts, lecturers and invited speakers have increased, but remain limited. JES-We-Can was found to be effective in reducing the gender gap in academic activities at JES, but JES-We-Can should support women more intensely to raise the rate of CEEs among all ages and BCEs currently over 50 y, and to promote more women into higher positions in JES in the future. These actions are expected to introduce new and diverse perspectives into academia.",Lapatinib decreases the ACTH production and proliferation of corticotroph tumor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880293,Endocrine journal,2019 03 18,"Cushing's disease is almost always caused by hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from a pituitary adenoma. A mutation in the deubiquitinase gene USP8 has been found in human ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma cells. This mutational hotspot hyperactivates USP8, rescuing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from lysosomal degradation and ensuring its sustained signaling in Cushing's disease. An EGFR inhibitor would be an effective anti-tumor agent in EGFR-related tumors. We investigated the effect of a potent dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, on ACTH production and cell proliferation in AtT-20 mouse corticotroph tumor cells. Lapatinib decreased proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) mRNA levels and ACTH levels in AtT-20 cells and also inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (Pttg1), a hallmark of pituitary tumors, mRNA levels. KSN/Slc nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with AtT-20 cells. After 1 week, the mice were randomized either to control or lapatinib groups. The inhibitor decreased the tumor weight of AtT-20 allografts in vivo versus control mice. Lapatinib also significantly decreased Pomc and Pttg1 mRNA levels in the tumor and plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels in vivo. Thus, lapatinib decreases the ACTH production and proliferation of corticotroph tumor cells.

In further support of the concept, that pretransplant therapy may favor the selection of resistant clones, patients in the upfront group had a higher likelihood to respond to HMAs as salvage therapy for relapse in comparison with pretreated patients (complete remission, 58% versus 10%; P = .0005) and a higher 2-year OS rate after relapse (59% versus 19%, P = .0001). These data suggest that an upfront transplant strategy is at least not inferior to pretransplant cytoreduction and may be augmented by HMAs + donor lymphocyte infusion salvage therapy in case of relapse after allo-HSCT.",Seasonality and community interventions in a mathematical model of Clostridium difficile transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880267,The Journal of hospital infection,2019 05 25,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea with peak incidence in late winter or early autumn.

While physiological inflammation is essential to counter a wide variety of damaging stimuli and to improve wound healing, dysregulated inflammation such as in the myocardium and vasculature can promote cardiovascular diseases. Given the high severity, prevalence, and economic burden of these diseases, understanding the factors involved in the regulation of physiological inflammation is essential. Like other complex biological phenomena, RNA-based processes are emerging as major regulators of inflammatory responses. Among such processes are cis-regulatory elements in the mRNA of inflammatory genes, noncoding RNAs directing the production or localization of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, or pathogenic RNA driving inflammatory responses. In this review, we describe several specific RNA-based molecular mechanisms by which physiological inflammation pertaining to cardiovascular diseases is regulated. These include the role of AU-rich element-containing mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, and viral RNAs.",HDAC inhibition induces autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880250,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 06 10,"The FDA-approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat) has been shown to induce cardiomyocyte autophagy and blunt ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury when administered at the time of reperfusion.

This is largely due to the lack of efficacious medicines for tumors, and thus development of potent anticancer agents is urgently needed. The thioredoxin (Trx) system is crucial to the survival ability of cells and its expression is up-regulated in many human tumors. Recently, increasing evidence has been established that mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a selenocysteine-containing protein and the core component of the thioredoxin system, is a promising therapeutic target. The sesquiterpene lactone compound cynaropicrin (CYN), a major component of Cynara scolymus L., has shown multiple pharmacological functions, especially the anticancer effect, in many experimental models. Most of these functions are concomitant with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nevertheless, the target of this promising natural anticancer product in redox control has rarely been explored. In this study, we showed that CYN induces apoptosis of Hela cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that CYN impinges on the thioredoxin system via inhibition of TrxR, which leads to Trx oxidation and ROS accumulation in HeLa cells. Particularly, the cytotoxicity of CYN is enhanced through the genetic knockdown of TrxR, supporting the pharmacological effect of CYN is relevant to its inhibition of TrxR. Together, our studies reveal an unprecedented mechanism accounting for the anticancer effect of CYN and identify a promising therapeutic agent worthy of further development for cancer therapy.",Cisplatin resistance involves a metabolic reprogramming through ROS and PGC-1α in NSCLC which can be overcome by OXPHOS inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880247,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 29,"Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for most lung cancer cases.

Imaging allows most often a rapid diagnosis, by ultrasound or CT, the latter being irradiant but also allowing to consider the differential diagnoses (digestive or urinary diseases) in case of pelvic pain. MRI, non-irradiating examination, whenever it is feasible, provides relevant information, more efficient, guiding quickly the diagnosis. The diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess should lead to the hospitalization of the patient, the collection of bacteriological samples, the initiation of a probabilistic antibiotherapy associated with drainage of the purulent collection. In severe septic forms (generalized peritonitis, septic shock), surgery (laparoscopy or laparotomy) keeps its place. In other situations, ultrasound-guided trans-vaginal puncture in the absence of major hemostasis disorders or severe sepsis is a less morbid alternative to surgery and provides high rates of cure. Today, ultrasound-guided trans-vaginal puncture has been satisfactory evaluated in the literature and is part of a logic of therapeutic de-escalation.

Ferroptosis was originally defined in 2012 as an iron-dependent form of cancer cell death different from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. However, this latter assumption came into question because, in response to ferroptosis activators (e.g., erastin and RSL3), autophagosomes accumulate, and because components of the autophagy machinery (e.g., ATG3, ATG5, ATG4B, ATG7, ATG13, and BECN1) contribute to ferroptotic cell death. In particular, NCOA4-facilitated ferritinophagy, RAB7A-dependent lipophagy, BECN1-mediated system xc- inhibition, STAT3-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and HSP90-associated chaperone-mediated autophagy can promote ferroptosis.

In order to define the physiological and regulatory networks controlling the oxidative stress response in the free-living bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, a whole transcriptome analysis of wild type and ΔoxyR strains in the presence of hydrogen peroxide for two different exposure times was carried out. The C. crescentus response to H2O2 includes a decrease of the assimilative sulfate reduction and a shift in the amino acid synthesis pathways into favoring the synthesis of histidine. Moreover, the expression of genes encoding enzymes for the depolymerization of polyhydroxybutyrate was increased, and the RpoH-dependent genes were severely repressed. Based on the expression pattern and sequence analysis, we postulate that OxyR is probably directly required for the induction of three genes (katG, ahpCF). The putative binding of OxyR to the ahpC regulatory region could be responsible for the use of one of two alternative promoters in response to oxidative stress. Nevertheless, OxyR is required for the expression of 103 genes in response to H2O2. Fur and part of its regulon were differentially expressed in response to hydrogen peroxide independently of OxyR. The non-coding RNA OsrA was upregulated in both strains, and an in silico analysis indicated that it may have a regulatory role. This work characterizes the physiological response to H2O2 in C. crescentus, the regulatory networks and differentially regulated genes in oxidative stress and the participation of OxyR in this process. It is proposed that besides OxyR, a second layer of regulation may be achieved by a small regulatory RNA and other transcriptional regulators."

The primary objective of this study was to identify predictors for the isolation of polymyxin-resistant (PR) carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) among hospitalized patients. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes of patients with PR-CRE infections. A retrospective case-control study including patients admitted to Singapore General Hospital between June 2012 and June 2016 was conducted. Cases were defined as patients who had clinical cultures from which a PR-CRE was isolated. Controls were randomly selected from patients with polymyxin-susceptible (PS) CRE admitted during the same period, and frequency-matched to site of isolation. We included 37 PR cases and 111 PS controls. Polymyxin resistance was detected predominantly in Enterobacter spp. (54.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (43.2%). Multilocus sequence typing showed little clonal relatedness among the isolates. mcr-1 was detected in two PR-CRE isolates. Multivariable analyses showed that PR-CRE isolation was associated with prior polymyxins (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 21.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.04-150.96) and carbapenem exposures (OR 3.74; CI 1.13-12.44), when adjusted for time at risk and bacteria species.

Most recently, it has been proposed as a novel X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) gene, where loss-of-function mutations have been identified in human patients. The precise molecular mechanisms that regulate PCTAIRE-1 remained largely obscure, and only a few cellular targets/substrates have been proposed with no clear functional significance. We and others recently showed that cyclin Y binds and activates PCTAIRE-1 via phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. In order to understand the physiological role that PCTAIRE-1 plays in brain, we have performed a chemical genetic screen in vitro using an engineered PCTAIRE-1/cyclin Y complex and mouse brain extracts. Our screen has identified potential PCTAIRE-1 substrates (AP2-Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1), dynamin 1, and synaptojanin 1) in brain that have been shown to regulate crucial steps of receptor endocytosis, and are involved in control of neuronal synaptic transmission. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and protein sequence analyses have identified potential PCTAIRE-1 regulated phosphorylation sites on AAK1 and we validated their PCTAIRE-1 dependence in a cellular study and/or brain tissue lysates. Our results shed light onto the missing link between PCTAIRE-1 regulation and proposed physiological functions, and provide a basis upon which to further study PCTAIRE-1 function in vivo and its potential role in neuronal/brain disorders.",Characterisation of the Ral GTPase inhibitor RBC8 in human and mouse platelets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880223,Cellular signalling,2019 05 21,"The Ral GTPases, RalA and RalB, have been implicated in numerous cellular processes, but are most widely known for having regulatory roles in exocytosis. Recently, we demonstrated that deletion of both Ral genes in a platelet-specific mouse gene knockout caused a substantial defect in surface exposure of P-selectin, with only a relatively weak defect in platelet dense granule secretion that did not alter platelet functional responses such as aggregation or thrombus formation. We sought to investigate the function of Rals in human platelets using the recently described Ral inhibitor, RBC8. Initial studies in human platelets confirmed that RBC8 could effectively inhibit Ral GTPase activation, with an IC50 of 2.2 μM and 2.3 μM for RalA and RalB, respectively. Functional studies using RBC8 revealed significant, dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation, secretion (α- and dense granule), integrin activation and thrombus formation, while α-granule release of platelet factor 4, Ca2+ signalling or phosphatidylserine exposure were unaltered. Subsequent studies in RalAB-null mouse platelets pretreated with RBC8 showed dose-dependent decreases in integrin activation and dense granule secretion, with significant inhibition of platelet aggregation and P-selectin exposure at 10 μM RBC8. This study strongly suggests therefore that although RBC8 is useful as a Ral inhibitor in platelets, it is likely also to have off-target effects in the same concentration range as for Ral inhibition. So, whilst clearly useful as a Ral inhibitor, interpretation of data needs to take this into account when assessing roles for Rals using RBC8.",Panobinostat (LBH589) inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via upregulating APCL expression in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880222,Cellular signalling,2019 05 01,"Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease among women worldwide and the novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Panobinostat (LBH589), a pan-HDACs inhibitor, has shown promising anti-tumor effect in recent years. However, the targets of this compound are largely unclear because of its low selectivity. In consideration of the transcription promoting activity of panobinostat, we speculated that specific tumor suppressor genes might be upregulated after panobinostat treatment. In this study, we verified the inhibition effect of panobinostat in different subtypes of breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. We found that panobinostat suppressed proliferation, migration as well as invasion, and induced apoptosis in both TNBC and non-TNBC cells. Consistently, panobinostat inhibited breast cancer growth and metastasis in mouse models. Mechanistically, we found APCL transcription and expression was significantly upregulated in panobinostat treated cells by RNA microarray analysis, while knockdown of APCL resulted in reduced sensitivity to panobinostat in breast cancer cells. APCL is a wnt/β-catenin pathway regulator that promotes β-catenin ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that panobinostat inhibited β-catenin expression by increasing its ubiquitylation and thus reducing its half-life. In addition, the expression of β-catenin activated targets including c-Jun, c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and CD44 were also decreased by panobinostat treatment in breast cancer cells. These results suggested that panobinostat inhibited tumor growth and metastasis via upregulating APCL expression in breast cancer cells, which was a novel and crucial mechanism of panobinostat.",The immediate and delayed effects of single tDCS session over posterior parietal cortex on face-word associative memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880221,Behavioural brain research,2019 04 07,"Associative memory (AM), an ability to form and retrieve associations between information units is crucial for everyday functioning and is affected by aging as well as by different neurological conditions. It was shown that rTMS over posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can improve AM of face-word pairs. Therefore, we examined if tDCS will produce comparable effects and explore whether the effect would persist one and five days following the stimulation. Thirty-seven healthy participants took part in cross-over sham-controlled study in which they received 20 min of anodal (1.5 mA) or sham tDCS over left PPC. Following tDCS participants completed face-cued word recall and verbal fluency tasks. A randomly selected subsample (N = 18) has completed follow up memory assessments one and five days after the stimulation. Anodal tDCS facilitated AM performance in comparison to sham with the same trend persisting during the 5-day follow-up period. Additionally, participants with lower AM scores had higher relative gain following anodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS had no effect on the control task (verbal fluency). Results support the existence of a specific enhancing effect on AM produced by facilitatory neuromodulation of the PPC. The effect was more prominent in low-performers and it persisted at least 5 days post-stimulation. These findings support the robustness of tDCS effect on AM and provide a foundation for future research that could lead to its future clinical application.","Social isolation and social support at adulthood affect epigenetic mechanisms, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and behavior of chronically stressed rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880220,Behavioural brain research,2019 04 07,"Epigenetic modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) provides one possible explanation for the dysfunctions induced by stress, such as psychiatric disorders and cognitive decline. Interestingly, social support can be protective against some of these effects, but the mechanisms of social buffering are poorly understood. Conversely, early isolation exacerbates the responses to stressors, although its effects in adulthood remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of social isolation and social buffering on hippocampal epigenetic mechanisms, BDNF levels and behavioral responses of chronically stressed young adult rats. Male Wistar rats (3 months) were assigned to accompanied (paired) or isolated housing. After one-month half of each group was submitted to a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol for 18 days. Among accompanied animals, only one was exposed to stress. Behavioral analysis encompassed the Open field, plus maze and inhibitory avoidance tasks. Hippocampal H3K9 and H4K12 acetylation, HDAC5 expression and BDNF levels were evaluated. Isolated housing increased HDAC5 expression, decreased H3K9 and H4K12 acetylation, reduced BDNF levels, and impaired long-term memory. Stress affected weight gain, induced anxiety-like behavior and decreased AcK9H3 levels. Interactions between housing conditions and social stress were seen only for HDAC5 expression, which showed a further increase in the isolated + CUS group but remained constant in accompanied animals. In conclusion, social isolation at adulthood induced epigenetic alterations and exacerbated the effects of chronic stress on HDAC5. Notwithstanding, social support counteracted the adverse effects of stress on HDAC5 expression.",A dyad shows mutual changes during social buffering of conditioned fear responses in male rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880219,Behavioural brain research,2019 04 07,"The presence of an affiliative conspecific reduces stress responses to a wide variety of stimuli. This phenomenon is termed ""social buffering"". We previously found that the presence of another naïve rat (associate) reduced conditioned fear responses to an auditory conditioned stimulus in a conditioned subject rat. Although we subsequently conducted a series of studies to examine behavioral, physiological, and neural changes during social buffering in the conditioned subject, the changes in the associate remained unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the behavioral and neural changes in the associate. Fear-conditioned and non-conditioned rats were re-exposed to the conditioned stimulus with an associate placed in the same enclosure (Experiment 1) or separated by a wire-mesh partition (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, the associate exhibited increased anogenital contact and allo-grooming, which were accompanied by increased c-Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and central amygdala. These results suggest that the subject and associate mutually affected each other during social buffering. In contrast, in Experiment 2, we found only a difference in the time course of investigation between associates tested with the conditioned and non-conditioned subjects. These results suggest that the associate was unable to acquire a sufficient amount of signal from the conditioned subject behind the wire-mesh partition necessary to show clear changes in behavior and c-Fos expression. Taken together, the current findings suggest that a dyad shows mutual changes during social buffering of conditioned fear responses in male rats.","Stimulation of eryptosis by broad-spectrum insect repellent N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880218,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 04 08,"N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is the most widely used insect repellent in the world. Adverse effects following DEET exposure are well documented. Moreover, DEET has been shown to possess cytotoxic and apoptotic properties in nucleated cells. Although red blood cells (RBCs) lack intracellular organelles, they nevertheless undergo programmed cell death termed eryptosis. Compromised RBC health contributes to the development of anemia; a condition affecting 25% of the global population. This study investigated the interaction between DEET and human RBCs, and explored accompanying biochemical and molecular alterations. RBCs at 5% hematocrit were incubated in presence and absence of 1-5 mM (0.02%-0.1%) of DEET for 6 h at 37 °C. Hemolysis was spectrophotometrically determined by hemoglobin release, while major eryptotic events were analyzed by flow cytometer. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure was detected with Annexin-V-FITC, cell volume by forward scatter (FSC) of light, intracellular calcium with Fluo-3/AM, and reactive oxygen species with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). DEET caused slight hemolysis at 4 and 5 mM, and significantly increased Annexin-V-FITC and Fluo3 fluorescence, with reduced FSC at 5 mM. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished DEET-induced Fluo3 fluorescence but had no effect on Annexin-V binding. Importantly, blockade of eryptotic signaling mediators p38 MAPK, caspases, protein kinase C, casein kinase 1, or necroptotic kinases receptor-interacting protein 1 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, with small molecule inhibitors, did not ameliorate DEET-mediated PS externalization. In conclusion, DEET elicits suicidal erythrocyte death; an event characterized by loss of membrane asymmetry, cell shrinkage, and elevations in intracellular Ca2+ mainly through dysregulated Ca2+ influx.",Coordinated cytochrome P450 expression in mouse liver and intestine under different dietary conditions during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880217,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 04 08,"Liver resection is performed to remove tumors in patients with liver cancer, but the procedure's suitability depends on the regenerative ability of the liver. It is important to consider the effects of exogenous factors, such as diets, on liver regeneration for the recovery of function. The evaluation of drug metabolism during liver regeneration is also necessary because liver dysfunction is generally observed after the operation. Here, we investigated the influence of a purified diet (AIN-93G) on liver regeneration and changes in the mRNA expression of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms in the liver and small intestine using a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) mouse model fed with a standard diet (MF) and a purified diet. Liver regeneration was significantly delayed in the purified diet group relative to that in the standard diet group. The liver Cyp2c55 and Cyp3a11 expression was increased at 3 day after PH especially in the purified diet group. Bile acid may partly cause the differences in liver regeneration and CYP expression between two types of diets. On the other hand, Cyp3a13 expression in the small intestine was transiently increased at day 1 after PH in both diet groups. The findings suggest that compensatory induction of the CYP expression occurred in the small intestine after attenuation of drug metabolism potential in the liver. The present results highlight the importance of the relationship between liver regeneration, drug metabolism, and exogenous factors for the effective treatment, including surgery and medication, in patients after liver resection or transplantation."

However, very little attention has been paid to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in this type of AKI. The aims of this review are to explore the evidence for the mechanisms and the therapeutic role of renal replacement therapy of wasp venom and AKI. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed for the association among wasp venom and AKI. Wasp venom is a complex mixture of biologically active components, including enzymes, amines, and peptides. Wasp venom may induce local anaphylaxis reactions as well as systemic reactions such as AKI. AKI may develop as a result of direct nephrotoxic effects of the venom or secondary intravascular hemolysis and/or rhabdomyolysis. Histopathological features of renal biopsies predominantly include acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis. Renal replacement therapy, which includes intermittent hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, continuous renal replacement therapy, and peritoneal dialysis, has been used to treat severe AKI cases induced by wasp stings. Continuous renal replacement therapy appears to provide more benefit than intermittent hemodialysis in the treatment of wasp sting-induced AKI. In this review, we summarize the existing evidence of the mechanisms and treatment for venom-induced AKI, with a particular emphasis on the role of renal replacement therapy in the management of severe AKI following massive wasp stings.",Synthetic Salicylic acid inducible recombinant promoter for translational research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880184,Journal of biotechnology,2019 04 21,"In the present study, we have developed an inter-molecularly shuffled caulimoviral promoter for protein over-expression by placing the Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS) of Figwort Mosaic Virus (FMV; -249 to -54) at the 5'-end of the Cassava Vein Mosaic Virus (CsVMV) promoter fragment 8 (CsVMV8; -215 to +166) to design a hybrid promoter; FUASCsV8CP. The FUASCsV8CP promoter exhibited approximately 2.1 and 2.0 times higher GUS-activities than that obtained from the CaMV35S promoter, in tobacco (Xanthi Brad) protoplasts and in Agroinfiltration assays respectively. Hereto, when FUASCsV8CP was assayed using transgenic tobacco plants (T2- generation), it showed 2.0 times stronger activity than CaMV35S promoter and almost equivalent activity to that of CaMV35S2 promoter. The promoter displayed Salicylic acid (SA) inducibility and hence can also be used for ensuring effective gene expression in plants under constitutive as well as specific inducible conditions. Furthermore, FUASCsV8CP was used to drive the expression of victoviral Vin gene (encoding Victoriocin) transiently in tobacco. The recombinant Victoriocin could be successfully detected by western blotting three days post infiltration.

To better understand the mechanism, it is necessary to identify formylation sites in proteins accurately. Computational method is popular because of its more convenience and higher speed than traditional experimental methods. However, no computational method has been proposed for prediction of lysine formylation. In this study, we developed a predictor named LFPred to identify lysine formylation sites using sequence features (including amino acid composition (AAC), binary profile features (BPF), and amino acid index (AAI)) combined K-nearest neighbor algorithm as classifier. We chose discrete window instead of continuous window according to information entropy. Besides, we took measure to select more reliable negative samples and address the severe imbalance between positive samples and negative samples. Finally, the performance of LFPred is measured with a specificity of 79.9% and a sensibility of 81.4% using jackknife test method, which indicated that our method can be a useful tool for prediction of lysine formylation sites.",Rutaecarpine prevented ox-LDL-induced VSMCs dysfunction through inhibiting overexpression of connexin 43.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880182,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Overexpression of connexin 43 (Cx43) was related to dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Our previous study reported that rutaecarpine, an active ingredient of herbal medicine Evodia, modulated connexins expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This study aims to explore the effects of rutaecarpine on Cx43 expression and VSMCs dysfunction induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). In cultured rat thoracic aortic VSMCs, ox-LDL upregulated the level of Cx43 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which were abolished by the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 and PDTC. Furthermore, exposure to ox-LDL for 4 h induced the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 in VMSCs. Ox-LDL (50 mg/l,48 h) induced dysfunction of VSMCs, demonstrated as excessive proliferation, migration, and phenotype switch of cells, which were attenuated by treatment with Cx43 gap junction blocker Gap26(100 μM)) or rutaecarpine (1, 3, and 10 µM). Rutaecarpine inhibited ox-LDL-induced upregulation of Cx43, prevented nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65, and increased intracellular calcium level in VSMCs. These effects were abolished by pretreatment with transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) antagonist capsazepine, intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM or CaM antagonist W-7. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that rutaecarpine inhibited Cx43 overexpression through TRPV1/[Ca2+]i/CaM/NF-κB signal pathway, thereby preventing VSMCs dysfunction induced by ox-LDL. Our study provides a novel mechanism by which rutaecarpine modulate Cx43 expression and VSMC function.",Comparative study of carvedilol and quinidine for inhibiting hKv4.3 channel stably expressed in HEK 293 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880181,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"The inhibition of transient outward potassium current (Ito) is the major ionic mechanism for quinidine to treat Brugada syndrome; however, quinidine is inaccessible in many countries. The present study compared the inhibitory effect of the nonselective β-adrenergic blocker carvedilol with quinidine on human Kv4.3 (hKv4.3, encoding for Ito) channel and action potential notch using a whole-cell patch technique in HEK 293 cell line expressing K﻿C﻿N﻿D﻿3 as well as in ventricular epicardial myocytes of rabbit hearts. It was found that carvedilol and quinidine inhibited hKv4.3 current in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 of carvedilol was 1.2 μM for inhibiting hKv4.3 charge area, while the IC50 of quinidine was 2.9 μM (0.2 Hz). Both carvedilol and quinidine showed typical o﻿p﻿e﻿n channel blocking properties (i.e. decreasing the time to peak of activation and increasing the inactivation of hKv4.3), negatively shifted the V1/2 of activation and inactivation, and slowed the recovery from inactivation of the channel. Although carvedilol had weaker in use- and rate-dependent inhibition of hKv4.3 peak current than quinidine, its reduction of the charge area was more than quinidine at all frequencies (0.2-3.3 Hz). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of carvedilol on action potential notch was greater than quinidine. These results provide the novel information that carvedilol, like quinidine, significantly inhibits hKv4.3 and action potential notch, suggesting that carvedilol is likely an alternative drug for preventing malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Brugada syndrome in countries where quinidine is unavailable.","A novel, highly-water-soluble apigenin derivative provides neuroprotection following ischemia in male rats by regulating the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880180,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 28,"6""-O-succinylapigenin [apigenin-7-O-(6'-O-succinyl)-glucoside], a novel compound, is identified in chamomile. Although it is highly produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FJ18, its bioactivity remains unknown. The neuroprotective effects and antioxidative mechanism of 6''-O-succcinylapigenin in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in male rats was investigated in this study. The structure of this compound was determined by spectroscopic data analysis. After 2 h of occlusion and 24 h of reperfusion, magnetic resonance imaging and assessed neurological scores following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in male rats to determine the infarction size and neurological deficits, respectively. In addition, we tested protein levels of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), to investigate the mechanism of antioxidative action of 6''-O-succcinylapigenin. Finally, we employed immunofluorescence to determine the location of Nrf2 and Keap1 in HT22 cells cultured in vitro. Our results revealed that administration of 6''-O-succcinylapigenin induced a decrease in both infarct volume and neurological scores following MCAO, and significantly increased the activity of HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2 in vivo. Similarly, immunofluorescence assays indicated that Nrf2 is highly expressed in the nucleus following treatment with 6''-O-succcinylapigenin in vitro. Our study suggests that 6''-O-succcinylapigenin exerts an anti-ischemic effect by activating the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.",Bupivacaine-induced contraction is attenuated by endothelial nitric oxide release modulated by activation of both stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation (Ser1177 and Thr495) of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880179,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"This study examined the mechanism associated with the endothelium-dependent attenuation of vasoconstriction induced by bupivacaine (BPV), with a particular focus on the upstream cellular signaling pathway of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation induced by BPV in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). BPV concentration-response curves were investigated in the isolated rat aorta. The effects of Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), methylene blue, calmidazolium, the Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(t-butyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) and the combination of L-arginine and L-NAME on BPV-induced contraction in endothelium-intact aorta preparations were examined. The effects of BPV alone and in combination with PP2 on the phosphorylation of eNOS (at Ser1177 or Thr495), caveolin-1 and Src kinase were examined in HUVECs. BPV-induced contraction was lower in endothelium-intact aortae than in endothelium-denuded aortae. L-NAME, ODQ, methylene blue and calmidazolium increased BPV-induced contraction in endothelium-intact aortae, whereas PP2 alone and combined treatment with L-arginine and L-NAME inhibited BPV-induced contraction. Low-concentration BPV (30 µM) induced both stimulatory (Ser1177) and inhibitory (Thr495) phosphorylation of eNOS in HUVECs. However, high-concentration BPV (150 µM) induced only stimulatory (Ser1177) eNOS phosphorylation. Additionally, phosphorylation of Src kinase, caveolin-1 and inhibitory eNOS (Thr495) induced by low-concentration BPV was inhibited by PP2. These results suggest that contraction induced by low-concentration BPV is attenuated by endothelial nitric oxide release, which is modulated both stimulatory (Ser1177) and inhibitory eNOS phosphorylation (Thr495). BPV-induced phosphorylation of eNOS (Thr495) is indirectly mediated by an upstream cellular signaling pathway involving Src kinase (Tyr416) and caveolin-1 (Tyr14).",Paeoniflorin protects pancreatic β cells from STZ-induced damage through inhibition of the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880178,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Pancreatic β-cells are responsible for insulin secretion and control of plasma glucose levels. Accumulating evidences indicate a relationship between β-cell dysfunction/death and diabetes onset. Paeoniflorin (PF), a natural glycoside, has antihyperglycemic effect. However, the role of PF in pancreatic β-cells has not been examined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of PF on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced β-cell damage. Our results showed that PF improved STZ-caused inhibitory effect on cell viability and insulin secretion ability in INS-1 cells. PF reduced caspase-3 activity and bax expression, and induced bcl-2 expression in STZ-treated INS-1 cells. PF resulted in a decrease in production of reactive oxygen species and MDA, and an increase in SOD activity in STZ-treated INS-1 cells. Furthermore, PF inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, which is induced by STZ in INS-1 cells. The results suggested that PF protected INS-1 cells from STZ-induced cell damage. Meanwhile, PF suppressed the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways in STZ-treated INS-1 cells. These results indicated that PF might be a natural anti-diabetic agent by improving pancreatic β-cells injury through inhibition of the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways.","Chiral ruthenium(II) complex Δ-[Ru(bpy)2(o-FMPIP)] (bpy = bipyridine, o-FMPIP = 2-(2'-trifluoromethyphenyl) imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline) as potential apoptosis inducer via DNA damage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880177,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Chiral ruthenium(II) complexes have long been considered as potential anticancer agents.

Furthermore, the mechanism studies on anti-angiogenic showed that D0402 could inhibit the formation of angiogenesis in the transgenic Tg(fli1a: EGFP) zebrafish. After treated with D0402, the sub-intestinal vessels(SIVs) of the zebrafish became disordered and chaotic, and was dosage dependent. Moreover, the TUNEL analysis and comet assays revealed that D0402 can induce apoptosis of HepG2 cell through DNA damage, and this was further demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis with the number of γ-H2AX increased following the increasing amount of D0402. Besides, in vivo toxicity of D0402 has also been investigated on the development of zebrafish embryo, and the results showed that there were no death or development delay occurred for zebrafish embryo treated with D0402 up to concentration of 60 μM. All in together, this study suggested that D0402 can be developed as a potential inhibitor against liver cancer through co-junction of anti-angiogenesis and apoptosis-inducing via DNA damage in the near future.","Glepaglutide, a novel long-acting glucagon-like peptide-2 analogue, for patients with short bowel syndrome: a randomised phase 2 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880176,The lancet.

However, the role of these three polymorphisms in a Han Chinese population from mainland China still remains to be clarified. We conducted a large sample study to examine genetic associations of rs6430538, rs199347 and rs14235 with PD in a Han Chinese population of 989 sporadic PD patients and 1058 healthy controls. All subjects were genotyped for these loci using the Sequenom iPLEX Assay. In addition, we conducted further stratified analysis according to age at onset and compared the clinical characteristics between minor allele carriers and non-carriers for each locus. However, no significant differences were found in genotype and allele frequency distribution between PD patients and controls for the three loci, even after being stratified by age at onset.

As its powerful potential to modulate neuronal functions, TrkB pathway is an attractive target for novel drugs and treatment of common neurological disorders. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a TrkB receptor agonist, has similar properties with neurotrophin Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF). DHF is reported to have a number of beneficial effects in neuroprotection, against depression and improving learning and memory. However, the outcome of acute application of DHF on the excitability of neuronal circuits is not clear. Especially the effects of DHF on synchronized epileptiform activity are not known. In this study, we investigated whether DHF induces epileptiform activity in brain slices and DHF has any effect on already initiated epileptiform discharges. We used acute horizontal hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices obtained from 30 to 35 days of mice. Extracellular field potential recordings were obtained from entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus CA1 region. DHF did not initiate any epileptiform activity or abnormal discharges. However, DHF increased the frequency of 4 aminopyridine (4AP) induced ictal and interictal events in both EC and CA1. The duration of induced ictal charges were also prolonged upon DHF application. In a number of slices, both EC and CA1, DHF led to ictogenesis. These results suggest that the acute activation of TrkB by DHF has a powerful potential on synchronized neuronal discharges which should be considered in future therapeutical approaches.",Elastic fibers and biomechanics of the aorta: Insights from mouse studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880160,Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology,2019 04 09,"Elastic fibers are major components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the aorta and support a life-long cycling of stretch and recoil. Elastic fibers are formed from mid-gestation throughout early postnatal development and the synthesis is regulated at multiple steps, including coacervation, deposition, cross-linking, and assembly of insoluble elastin onto microfibril scaffolds. To date, more than 30 molecules have been shown to associate with elastic fibers and some of them play a critical role in the formation and maintenance of elastic fibers in vivo. Because the aorta is subjected to high pressure from the left ventricle, elasticity of the aorta provides the Windkessel effect and maintains stable blood flow to distal organs throughout the cardiac cycle. Disruption of elastic fibers due to congenital defects, inflammation, or aging dramatically reduces aortic elasticity and affects overall vessel mechanics. Another important component in the aorta is the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Elastic fibers and SMCs alternate to create a highly organized medial layer within the aortic wall. The physical connections between elastic fibers and SMCs form the elastin-contractile units and maintain cytoskeletal organization and proper responses of SMCs to mechanical strain. In this review, we revisit the components of elastic fibers and their roles in elastogenesis and how a loss of each component affects biomechanics of the aorta. Finally, we discuss the significance of elastin-contractile units in the maintenance of SMC function based on knowledge obtained from mouse models of human disease.",Factors That Impact Fertility after Hysteroscopic Adhesiolysis for Intrauterine Adhesions and Amenorrhea: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880159,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 04 13,"To identify factors that affect reproductive outcomes after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis in patients with severe intrauterine adhesions (IUAs, scored between 9 and 12 according to the American Fertility Society classification) and amenorrhea.",Assessment of Tubal Patency: A Prospective Comparison of Diagnostic Hysteroscopy and Laparoscopic Chromopertubation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880158,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 04 14,"To evaluate whether the presence of a visualizable ""flow"" effect in the fallopian tube ostia in hysteroscopy was predictive of tubal patency.","Detection of Trichinella britovi in pork sausage suspected to be implicated in a human outbreak in Mendoza, Argentina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880157,Parasitology international,2019 05 15,"Of the three Trichinella species described in South America, T. spiralis, T. pseudospiralis and T. patagoniensis, only the former has been implicated in human infections from consumption of pork-derived products. During a presumed trichinellosis outbreak in 2012 in Mendoza, Argentina, we evaluated the serological responses of three patients who had eaten the incriminated food and had signs and symptoms compatible with trichinellosis, using ELISA. We also analyzed potentially contaminated pork sausage by artificial digestion technique and recovered Trichinella muscle larvae, which were identified to the species level using a PCR multiplex assay and by sequencing a region of the mitochondrial gene coding cytochrome oxidase subunit I. No antibodies were detected in the sera of the patients, probably because the samples were collected during the immunological window period. According to molecular identification, all larvae from the sausage corresponded to T. britovi. Trichinella britovi is reported here for the first time in the American Continent, and represents the only cold-tolerant member of the genus in the Neotropics. This species was most likely introduced from Europe to South America during Spanish colonization through pigs, wild boars and/or rats.",Stabilization of the Max Homodimer with a Small Molecule Attenuates Myc-Driven Transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880155,Cell chemical biology,2019 05 17,"The transcription factor Max is a basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) protein that forms homodimers or interacts with other bHLHLZ proteins, including Myc and Mxd proteins. Among this dynamic network of interactions, the Myc/Max heterodimer has crucial roles in regulating normal cellular processes, but its transcriptional activity is deregulated in a majority of human cancers. Despite this significance, the arsenal of high-quality chemical probes to interrogate these proteins remains limited. We used small molecule microarrays to identify compounds that bind Max in a mechanistically unbiased manner. We discovered the asymmetric polycyclic lactam, KI-MS2-008, which stabilizes the Max homodimer while reducing Myc protein and Myc-regulated transcript levels. KI-MS2-008 also decreases viable cancer cell growth in a Myc-dependent manner and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of modulating Max with small molecules and supports altering Max dimerization as an alternative approach to targeting Myc.",Copying Life: Synthesis of an Enzymatically Active Mirror-Image DNA-Ligase Made of D-Amino Acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880154,Cell chemical biology,2019 05 17,"Our objective is the creation of a mirror-image synthetic biology: that is, to mimic, entirely independent of Nature, a biological system and to re-create it from artificial component parts. Utilizing enantiomeric L-nucleotides and D-amino acids rather than the natural components, we use chemical synthesis toward a basic, self-replicating mirror-image biological system. Here, we report the synthesis of a functional DNA-ligase in the D-enantiomeric conformation, which is an exact mirror-image of the natural enzyme, exhibiting DNA ligation activity on chirally inverted nucleic acids in L-conformation, but not acting on natural substrates and with natural co-factors. Starting from the known structure of the Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 DNA-ligase and the homologous but shorter DNA-ligase of Haemophilus influenza, we designed and synthesized chemically peptides, which could then be assembled into a full-length molecule yielding a functional protein. The structure and the activity of the mirror-image ligase were characterized, documenting its enantiospecific functionality.",Effects of in utero androgen excess and metformin treatment on hepatic functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880153,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2019 06 01,"This study aimed to evaluate the role of prenatal hyperandrogenization in liver functions and the extent of metformin as treatment. Pregnant rats were hyperandrogenized with subcutaneous testosterone (1mg/rat) between 16 and 19 of pregnancy.

From day 70 to the moment of sacrifice (90 days of age), 50% of the animals of each group received a daily oral dose of 50 mg/kg of metformin. We found that both PH phenotypes displayed a hepatic disruptions of insulin and glucose pathway and that metformin treatment reversed some of these alterations in a specific-phenotype manner. Our findings show, for the first time, that androgen excess in utero promotes hepatic dysfunctions and that metformin treatment is able to specifically reverse those hepatic alterations and sheds light on the possible mechanisms of metformin action.",Multi-dry-electrode plate sensor for non-invasive electrocardiogram and heart rate monitoring for the assessment of drug responses in freely behaving mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880152,Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods,2019 05 21,"Monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate (HR) is essential in a wide range of experiments. For conscious animal studies, telemetry is the preferred approach; however, it requires 1-3 weeks of recovery after surgical device-implantation. The present paper describes a novel multi-dry-electrode plate (MDEP) sensor system to monitor ECG/HR in freely behaving mice without the need for surgery for device/electrode implantation. The MDEP sensor is a rectangular plate with 15 gold-plated stripe pattern electrodes, on which a mouse can walk around freely, and detects ECG whenever ≥2 paws (footpads) come in contact with the electrodes. Here we show that the MDEP sensor detected distinct QRS complexes which, were fragmented due to locomotion and insufficient perspiration on the footpads. Nonetheless, the HR calculated from the QRS complexes were similar to the HR calculated from R-R intervals simultaneously recorded from lead-II ECG (difference = 0.0 ± 0.16 ms) as part of the validation exercise. Also, the archetypal responses to isoproterenol and metoprolol injections were successfully detected as a significantly elevation (+151 ± 15 bpm) and reduction (-77 ± 6 bpm) in HR, respectively, compared to vehicle at 20-60 min postdose. Conversely, the P wave was rarely identifiable unless signal averaging was undertaken. These results indicate a potential utility for the MDEP-sensor system for cardiac pharmacological studies. In addition, signal averaging appeared to be effective for detection of ECG intervals such as PR and QT, although the QT cannot be measured in the mouse heart as there is no T wave."

Animal models of opioid dependence are fundamental for studying the etiology of addictive behaviors. We tested the hypothesis that extended access to heroin self-administration leads to increases in heroin intake and produces somatic signs of opioid dependence in both male and female mice. Adult C57BL/6J mice were trained to nosepoke (fixed-ratio 1) to obtain intravenous heroin in six daily 1-h sessions (30-60 μg/kg/infusion). The mice were divided into short access (ShA; 1 h) and long access (LgA; 6 h) groups. Immediately after the 10th escalation session, the mice received a challenge dose of naloxone (1 mg/kg), and somatic signs of withdrawal were recorded. The mice readily acquired intravenous heroin self-administration. LgA mice escalated their drug intake in the first hour across sessions and had significantly higher scores of somatic signs of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal compared with ShA mice. Female mice exhibited increases in heroin intake compared with male mice. Male and female mice exhibited similar levels of somatic signs of withdrawal. Because of the wide availability of genetically modified mouse lines, the present mouse model may be particularly useful for better understanding genetic and sex differences that underlie the transition to compulsive-like opioid taking and seeking.",Role of agonist efficacy in exposure-induced enhancement of mu opioid reward in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880123,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"The abuse potential of opioid analgesics in humans appears to increase rapidly during initial regimens of opioid exposure. Previous work using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), a preclinical procedure useful for studying rewarding drug effects in drug-naïve animals, has similarly shown that rewarding effects of mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists increase rapidly in rats during initial regimens of opioid administration. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of MOR agonist efficacy as a determinant in eliciting this trajectory of increased rewarding effects during initial opioid exposure in opioid-naïve rats. Separate groups of adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats responded for electrical brain stimulation using a frequency-rate ICSS procedure and received repeated daily treatment with vehicle or one of five MOR agonists that ranged from low to high efficacy (NAQ, nalbuphine, buprenorphine, fentanyl, methadone). Two additional groups were used to evaluate effects of repeated treatment with non-opioids (the cannabinoid CP55940 or the monoamine releaser amphetamine). Morphine was tested after each repeated treatment. In opioid-naïve rats tested before repeated dosing, MOR agonists produced primarily dose- and efficacy-dependent decreases in ICSS. Following repeated treatment, all MOR agonists except NAQ produced tolerance to opioid-induced rate-decreasing effects and enhanced expression of ICSS facilitation (indicative of opioid reward) by both the repeatedly administered drug and morphine. Repeated treatment with CP55940 and amphetamine produced different effects. Collectively, these results provide evidence to suggest that enhanced expression of opioid reward after initial regimens of opioid exposure has a low requirement for MOR agonist efficacy and is pharmacologically selective.",Evaluation of N-acetylcysteine on ethanol self-administration in ethanol-dependent rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880122,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Many components of ethanol addiction such as reinforcement, withdrawal, extinction, and relapse are known to involve glutamate transmission. NAC could counteract glutamatergic dysregulation underlying ethanol addiction. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment to reduce ethanol consumption, motivation, seeking, and relapse in rats displaying a binge drinking-like phenotype. The current study assessed whether acute NAC could reduce ethanol self-administration, ethanol-seeking behavior, motivation, and reacquisition of ethanol self-administration following abstinence in ethanol-dependent rats. Ethanol dependence was induced by chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure for 10 weeks in male Wistar rats. Effects of NAC (0, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg; i.p.) were evaluated during acute withdrawal, 8 h after inhalation chambers were turned off. We evaluated NAC effect on the expression of the xCT protein expression (the target of NAC) and glutamate transporters (GLT-1) in dependent rats. We showed that in dependent rats, the low dose of NAC (25 mg/kg) reduced ethanol self-administration and motivation to consume ethanol, evaluated in a progressive ratio paradigm. At 50 mg/kg, but not 25 mg/kg, NAC reduced extinction responding and reacquisition of self-administration after 1 month abstinence. The xCT protein expression was decreased in the nucleus accumbens in dependent compared with ethanol-naïve rats. Thus, NAC may be effective by decreasing glutamate transmission through presynaptic mechanisms (i.e. the stimulation of xc--mediated increase in extrasynaptic glutamate levels). Our results demonstrate that NAC decreased ethanol self-administration, extinction responding, and relapse in ethanol-dependent animals, and thus strongly support clinical development of NAC for alcohol use disorders."

Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) plays important roles in regulating the cardiovascular activity. The current study aimed to investigate the roles of Ang-(1-7) in modulating blood pressure, vascular tension and its signal pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The effects of intravenous injection of drugs were determined in rats with anesthesia in vivo. Mesenteric artery (MA), coronary artery (CA) and pulmonary artery (PA) were isolated from rats and isometric tension measurements in arteries were performed. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), the high K+ induced vasoconstriction was enhanced and acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation were attenuated in the MA, CA and PA in SHR. Intravenous injection of Ang-(1-7) decreased, while A-779 increased mean arterial pressure and abolished the hypotensive effect of Ang-(1-7) in SHR. Ang-(1-7) caused dose-dependent relaxation in MA, CA and PA in SHR, which was inhibited by pretreatment with Mas receptor antagonist A-779, nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor l-NAME, guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ and protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor DT-2. The Mas receptor expression, NO, cGMP and PKG levels of the three above arteries of SHR were lower than that of WKY. Ang-(1-7) increased the NO, cGMP and PKG levels in arteries from SHR, which was blocked by A-779.

The degree of acrylation was determined by permanganatometric titration. The slug mucosal irritation test was used to demonstrate non-irritant nature of EPO and its acrylated derivatives (AEPO). The mucoadhesive properties of EPO and AEPO were evaluated using freshly excised sheep nasal mucosa and it was demonstrated that acrylated polymers facilitated greater retention of sodium fluorescein on mucosal surfaces compared to solution mixture of this dye solution with EPO as well as free dye.","Optimization of peptide-based cancer vaccine compositions, by sequential screening, using versatile liposomal platform.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880104,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 12,"Therapeutic cancer vaccines need thoughtful design to efficiently deliver appropriate antigens and adjuvants to the immune system. In the current study, we took advantage of the versatility of a liposomal platform to conceive and customize vaccines containing three elements needed for the induction of efficient antitumor immunity: i) a CD4 epitope peptide able to activate CD4+ T helper cells, ii) a CD8 tumor-specific epitope peptide recognized by CD8+ T cytotoxic cells and iii) Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) agonists which stand as adjuvants. Each type of component, conjugated to liposomes, was evaluated individually by comparing their vaccine efficacy after immunization of naïve mice. These screening steps resulted in the optimization of three liposomal constructs bearing a peptide from HA influenza virus protein as CD4 epitope, a peptide from HPV16 E7 oncoprotein as CD8 epitope and TLR4, TLR2/6 or NOD1 agonists as adjuvant, which displayed antitumor efficiency against a mouse model of disseminated tumors transformed by HPV16. Our results validated the interest of our customizable liposomal platform as delivery system for cancer vaccination. We also demonstrated its interest as tool for vaccine design allowing the strategical selection of components, and the evaluation of epitope-adjuvant association.",Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Infiltrate the Brain and Suppress Neuroinflammation in a Mouse Model of Focal Traumatic Brain Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880103,Neuroscience,2019 06 05,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have strong immunosuppressive characteristics, which allow them to limit inflammation and facilitate wound healing and recovery.

In this study, we explored the suppressive role of MDSCs in cerebral inflammatory reactions after focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) using in vivo imaging. Through morphological, functional, and phenotypic analyses we determined that CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells infiltrating the contusion area are MDSCs. MDSCs are among the first responders to tissue injury, responding even prior to microglial activation. Positron emission tomography imaging of translocator protein results suggest that infiltrating MDSCs suppress neuronal inflammation and interact with resident immune cells, like microglia, following focal TBI.",Isoflavones Alter Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Response Following Photoperiod Alteration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880102,Neuroscience,2019 06 07,"Photoperiod and diet are factors known to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Specifically, shifts in photoperiod have been previously linked with affective and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, isoflavones have been shown to mediate behavioral outcome in response to the environment of the animal. Here, we investigated the effect of photoperiod alteration on the HPA axis and how the addition of isoflavones might modulate the response to stress. Male C57BL/6J mice were maintained on either a 12:12 or a 16:8 light-dark (LD) cycle for 10 days, and fed a diet of either standard rodent chow or an isoflavone free (IF) chow beginning 3 weeks prior to light alteration. Consistent with previous work, mice in the shorter active period (16:8 LD cycle) showed increased basal corticosterone (CORT) secretion. In the absence of isoflavones, this response was attenuated. Increases in mineralcorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptor mRNA expression were seen in the pituitary following photoperiod alteration. However, animals fed the standard isoflavone rich chow showed increases in the ratio of MR:GR mRNA in the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis following photoperiod alteration. Decreases in corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) mRNA expression were seen in animals fed the IF chow in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus. These data suggest that alterations in CORT secretion following photoperiod alteration may be mediated through differences in CRFR1 gene expression or changes in MR:GR mRNA ratios. These findings provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which the HPA axis adapts to photoperiod and diet.",Changes in emotional processing following interoceptive network stimulation with rTMS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880101,Neuroscience,2019 06 05,"Theories of emotion suggest a close relation of interoception and emotion. However, knowledge of underlying neuronal networks is still sparse. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is one neurostimulation method allowing causal conclusions between functions and brain regions via stimulation or inhibition of underlying brain structures. In this study, rTMS with a continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol was used aiming for inhibition of important interoceptive network structures (frontotemporal insular network and right somatosensory cortices). Stimulation effects were investigated on interoceptive accuracy (IAc), emotional evaluation and neuronal correlates of emotional picture processing in 18 male participants. The main findings were an emotional flattening in subjective valences for affective stimuli after inhibition of the frontotemporal anterior insular network and of somatosensory cortices, being mirrored in visual evoked potentials as increased N2/decreased P3, indicating an initial orientation reaction followed by decreased attentional processing of positive stimuli. Moreover, cardiac and respiratory IAc were positively associated with P3 amplitudes and negatively related to positive valence ratings. Positive associations of decreases of cardiac/respiratory IAc with decreases of arousal ratings and decreases of P3 amplitudes for negative stimuli after inhibition of the frontotemporal insular network and after inhibition of somatosensory cortices allow the conclusion of a causal relationship between reduced activity in interoceptive network structures and blunted emotional processing of visual stimuli. Our results suggest that both arousal, and valence aspects of emotional processing are disturbed after inhibition of interoceptive network structures, confirming core assumptions of peripheral theories of emotions and models of interoceptive predictive coding.",Prediction of aptamer-protein interacting pairs based on sparse autoencoder feature extraction and an ensemble classifier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880100,Mathematical biosciences,2019 06 02,"Aptamer-protein interacting pairs play important roles in physiological functions and structural characterization. Identifying aptamer-protein interacting pairs is challenging and limited, despite of the tremendous applications of aptamers. Therefore, it is vital to construct a high prediction performance model for identifying aptamer-target interacting pairs. In this study, a novel ensemble method is presented to predict aptamer-protein interacting pairs by integrating sequence characteristics derived from aptamers and the target proteins. The features extracted for aptamers were the compositions of amino acids and pseudo K-tuple nucleotides. In addition, a sparse autoencoder was used to characterize features for the target protein sequences. To remove redundant features, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and incremental feature selection (IFS) methods were used to obtain the optimum combination of sequence characters. Based on 616 selected features, an ensemble of three sub- support vector machine (SVM) classifiers was used to construct our prediction model. Evaluated on an independent dataset, our predictor obtained an accuracy of 75.7%, Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.478, and Youden's Index of 0.538, which were superior to the values reached using other existing predictors.

To date, however, research on children's food consumption has generally prioritized the views of parents and caregivers, rather than children themselves. This paper reports results from a qualitative study that explored preadolescent children's attitudes and perceptions towards health and nutrition. 38 children aged 11-12 years, across three state government schools, took part in an individual interview or group interview. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis techniques. Our results indicate that children inextricably linked the concept of health to diet and physical activity. They pondered the connection between different types of foods and physical implications for the body, emphasising nutrition and physical activity as a resource for preventing the onset of chronic disease and specifically the state of 'fatness'. Children collectively overemphasised the correlation between body size and health, and expressed that people should take responsibility for healthy choices to prevent fatness. In their discussions, they referred to aesthetic elements of the body and negative consequences of obesity. Overall, we argue that children's discourses of health and nutrition are potentially problematic. Results suggest that it is important to reshape these ideas to encourage children to develop more positive relationships with food and physical activity.",Understanding the mechanistic basis of non-coding RNA through molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880083,Journal of structural biology,2019 05 18,"Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) has a key role in regulating gene expression, mediating fundamental processes and diseases via a variety of yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we review recent applications of conventional and enhanced Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations methods to address the mechanistic function of large biomolecular systems that are tightly involved in the ncRNA function and that are of key importance in life sciences. This compendium focuses of three biomolecular systems, namely the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing machinery, group II intron ribozyme and the ribonucleoprotein complex of the spliceosome, which edit and process ncRNA. We show how the application of a novel accelerated MD simulations method has been key in disclosing the conformational transitions underlying RNA binding in the CRISPR-Cas9 complex, suggesting a mechanism for RNA recruitment and clarifying the conformational changes required for attaining genome editing. As well, we discuss the use of mixed quantum-classical MD simulations in deciphering the catalytic mechanism of RNA splicing as operated by group II intron ribozyme, one of the largest ncRNA structures crystallized so far. Finally, we debate the future challenges and opportunities in the field, discussing the recent application of MD simulations for unraveling the functional biophysics of the spliceosome, a multi-mega Dalton complex of proteins and small nuclear RNAs that performs RNA splicing in humans. This showcase of applications highlights the current talent of MD simulations to dissect atomic-level details of complex biomolecular systems instrumental for the design of finely engineered genome editing machines. As well, this review aims at inspiring future investigations of several other ncRNA regulatory systems, such as micro and small interfering RNAs, which achieve their function and specificity using RNA-based recognition and targeting strategies.",Variations in the secondary structures of PAM proteins influence their binding affinities to human plasminogen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880082,Journal of structural biology,2019 05 09,"M-proteins (M-Prts) are major virulence determinants of Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) that are covalently anchored to the cell wall at their conserved COOH-termini while the NH2-terminal regions extend through the capsule into extracellular space. Functional M-Prts are also secreted and/or released from GAS cells where they exist as helical coiled-coil dimers in solution. Certain GAS strains (Pattern D) uniquely express an M-protein (plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-protein; PAM) that directly interacts with human plasminogen (hPg), a process strongly implicated in the virulence of these strains. M-Prt expressed by the emm gene is employed to serotype over 250 known strains of GAS, ∼20 of which are hitherto found to express PAMs. We have developed a modular structural model of the PAM dimer that describes the roles of different domains of this protein in various functions. While the helical COOH-terminal domains of PAM are essential for dimerization in solution, regions of its NH2-terminal domains also exhibit a weak potential to dimerize. We find that temperature controls the open (unwound) or closed (wound) states of the functional NH2-terminal domains of PAM. As temperature increases, α-helices are dramatically reduced, which concomitantly destabilizes the helical coiled-coil PAM dimers. PAMs with two a-repeats within the variable NH2-terminal A-domain (class I/III) bind to hPg tightly, but natural PAM isolates with a single a-repeat in this domain (class II) display dramatic changes in hPg binding with temperature. We conclude that coexistence of two a-repeats in PAM is critical to achieve optimal binding to hPg, especially in its monomeric form, at the biologically relevant temperature.",Structural and spectroscopic characterization of HCP2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880081,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Bioenergetics,2019 04 07,"The Helical Carotenoid Proteins (HCPs) are a large group of newly identified carotenoid-binding proteins found in ecophysiologically diverse cyanobacteria. They likely evolved before becoming the effector (quenching) domain of the modular Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). The number of discrete HCP families-at least nine-suggests they are involved in multiple distinct functions. Here we report the 1.7 Å crystal structure of HCP2, one of the most widespread HCPs found in nature, from the chromatically acclimating cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7601. By purifying HCP2 from the native source we are able to identify its natively-bound carotenoid, which is exclusively canthaxanthin. In solution, HCP2 is a monomer with an absorbance maximum of 530 nm. However, the HCP2 crystals have a maximum absorbance at 548 nm, which is accounted by the stacking of the β1 rings of the carotenoid in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Our results demonstrate how HCPs provide a valuable system to study carotenoid-protein interactions and their spectroscopic implications, and contribute to efforts to understand the functional roles of this large, newly discovered family of pigment proteins, which to-date remain enigmatic.",Enhanced NPQ affects long-term acclimation in the spring ephemeral Berteroa incana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880080,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Bioenergetics,2019 03 24,"The spring ephemeral Berteroa incana is a familial relative of Arabidopsis thaliana and thrives in a diverse range of terrestrial ecosystems. Within this study, the novel chlorophyll fluorescence parameter of photochemical quenching in the dark (qPd) was used to measure the redox state of the primary quinone electron acceptor (QA) in order to estimate the openness of photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres (RC). From this, the early onset of photoinactivation can be sensitively quantified alongside the light tolerance of PSII and the photoprotective efficiency of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This study shows that, with regards to A. thaliana, NPQ is enhanced in B. incana in both low-light (LL) and high-light (HL) acclimation states. Moreover, light tolerance is increased by up to 500%, the rate of photoinactivation is heavily diminished, and the ability to recover from light stress is enhanced in B. incana, relative to A. thaliana. This is due to faster synthesis of zeaxanthin and a larger xanthophyll cycle (XC) pool available for deepoxidation. Moreover, preferential energy transfer via CP47 around the RC further enhances efficient photoprotection. As a result, a high functional cross-section of photosystem II is maintained and is not downregulated when B. incana is acclimated to HL. A greater capacity for protective NPQ allows B. incana to maintain an enhanced light-harvesting capability when acclimated to a range of light conditions. This enhancement of flexible short-term protection saves the metabolic cost of long-term acclimatory changes.",Synchronous delivery of hydroxyapatite and connective tissue growth factor derived osteoinductive peptide enhanced osteogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880079,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 05 04,"In bone tissue engineering, electrospun fibrous scaffolds can provide excellent mechanical support, extracellular matrix mimicking components, such as 3D spacial fibrous environment for cell growth and controlled release of signaling molecules for osteogenesis. Here, a facile strategy comprising the incorporation of an osteogenic inductive peptide H1, derived from the cysteine knot (CT) domain of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), in the core of Silk Fibroin (SF) was developed for osteogenic induction, synergistically with co-delivering hydroxyapatite (HA) from the shell of poly(l-lactic acid-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL). The core-shell nanofibrous structure was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the sustained released H1 has effectively promoted proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPS-MSCs). Moreover, after 8 weeks implantation in mice, this SF-H1/PLCL-HA composite induced bone tissue formation significantly faster than SF/PLCL as indicated by μCT. The present study is the first to demonstrate that release of short hydrophilic peptides derived from CTGF combined with HA potentiated the regenerative capacity for healing critical sized calvarial defect in vivo.","WDR5, BRCA1, and BARD1 Co-regulate the DNA Damage Response and Modulate the Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition during Early Reprogramming.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880078,Stem cell reports,2019 04 17,"Differentiated cells are epigenetically stable, but can be reprogrammed to pluripotency by expression of the OSKM transcription factors. Despite significant effort, relatively little is known about the cellular requirements for reprogramming and how they affect the properties of induced pluripotent stem cells. We have performed high-content screening with small interfering RNAs targeting 300 chromatin-associated factors and extracted colony-level quantitative features. This revealed five morphological phenotypes in early reprogramming, including one displaying large round colonies exhibiting an early block of reprogramming. Using RNA sequencing, we identified transcriptional changes associated with these phenotypes. Furthermore, double knockdown epistasis experiments revealed that BRCA1, BARD1, and WDR5 functionally interact and are required for the DNA damage response. In addition, the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is affected in Brca1, Bard1, and Wdr5 knockdowns. Our data provide a resource of chromatin-associated factors in early reprogramming and underline colony morphology as an important high-dimensional readout for reprogramming quality.",Deep Learning Neural Networks Highly Predict Very Early Onset of Pluripotent Stem Cell Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880077,Stem cell reports,2019 04 17,"Deep learning is a significant step forward for developing autonomous tasks. One of its branches, computer vision, allows image recognition with high accuracy thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our goal was to train a CNN with transmitted light microscopy images to distinguish pluripotent stem cells from early differentiating cells. We induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to epiblast-like cells and took images at several time points from the initial stimulus. We found that the networks can be trained to recognize undifferentiated cells from differentiating cells with an accuracy higher than 99%. Successful prediction started just 20 min after the onset of differentiation. Furthermore, CNNs displayed great performance in several similar pluripotent stem cell (PSC) settings, including mesoderm differentiation in human induced PSCs. Accurate cellular morphology recognition in a simple microscopic set up may have a significant impact on how cell assays are performed in the near future.",Glycolysis Regulates Human Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal under Hypoxia through HIF-2α and the Glycolytic Sensors CTBPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880076,Stem cell reports,2019 04 17,"Glycolysis and hypoxia are key regulators of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal, but how changes in metabolism affect gene expression is poorly understood. C-terminal binding proteins (CTBPs) are glycolytic sensors that through NADH binding link the metabolic state of the cell to its gene expression, by acting as transcriptional corepressors, or coactivators. However, the role of CTBPs in hESCs has not previously been investigated. A direct interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and the CTBP proximal promoters in hESCs cultured only under hypoxia was demonstrated. Decreasing the rate of flux through glycolysis in hESCs maintained under hypoxia resulted in a reduction of CTBPs, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, but also in the expression of HIF-2α. Silencing CTBP expression resulted in the loss of pluripotency marker expression demonstrating that CTBPs are involved in hESC maintenance. These data suggest that under hypoxia, glycolysis regulates self-renewal through HIF-2α and the induction of the metabolic sensors CTBPs.",Trends in Urethral Stricture Disease Etiology and Urethroplasty Technique From a Multi-institutional Surgical Outcomes Research Group.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880075,Urology,2019 05 21,To analyze contemporary urethroplasty trends and urethral stricture etiologies over a 7-year study period among urologists from a large multi-institutional surgical outcomes group.

In this context, the consequences of macromolecular crowding on stem bromelain (BM) are explored, which is important for its industrial application. Herein, the effect of dextran (D70) and polyethylene glycol (P12 and P20) on native BM structure are investigated. The effect of crowder molecules on BM are deduced by combining the results of absorption, circular dichroism, fluorescence and activity studies. Additionally, molecular level interactions are investigated with molecular docking studies. Our results display that BM acts differently in higher and lower concentrations of crowding agents. Furthermore, crowding leads to alteration of protein structure and activity as compared to the dilute solutions. We observed that D70, is a very effective thermal stabilizing agent, while P12 is moderately stabilizing, on the other hand, P20 is destabilizing the BM structure. In the present study, the overall effect of crowders was destabilizing and deactivating on enzyme. Therefore, this study provides yet another example where soft interaction is dominating over the excluded volume effect.",Effect of NaCl on physicochemical properties of xanthan gum - Water chestnut starch complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880058,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"Pasting and functional properties of water chestnut starch (WCS) alone and mixture of WCS and xanthan gum (XG) were determined by addition of NaCl (0.5, 1, and 2%) at fixed water chestnut starch (5%) and xanthan gum (0.3%) concentration. Results indicated that presence of NaCl had a significant impact on functional and pasting properties of both WCS alone and WCS - XG mixture. Pasting temperature of WCS and WCS - XG mixture increased linearly with increasing salt content, whereas a reverse trend was observed in peak viscosity and sets back in case of WCS alone. It was found that addition of NaCl decreased the swelling power of WCS alone, while it increased in case of WCS - XG mixture. The water absorption of WCS - XG improved drastically by the addition of NaCl while a rapid decline in syneresis was observed with WCS - XG mixture. The transparency of both WCS and WCS - XG mixture were found to be increased after the addition of NaCl.","Insights on the reactivity of chondroitin and hyaluronan toward 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880057,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) cross-linked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) are hydrogels with many biomedical applications. Degree of substitution, cross-linking and substitution position of the cross-linker might influence the properties of the hydrogels. We showed earlier that the most common substitution position of the cross-linker on the hyaluronan chain was the 4-hydroxyl of N-acetylglucosamine. This result has led us to investigate unsulfated chondroitin (CN) which only differ from HA in the primary structure by the configuration at C4 of the aminoglycan. In the present study, we have investigated (i) the substitution positions of the cross-linker in CN using NMR and LC-MS and compared the results to the data obtained for HA (ii) the effect of alkali on the 13C and 1H chemical shifts in CN and HA (iii) the temperature coefficients and chemical shifts of hydroxyl protons in CN and HA. In CN, the 2-hydroxyl of glucuronic acid and 6-hydroxyl of N-acetylgalactosamine were found to be the major sites of substitution by BDDE. Moreover, while chondroitinase was not able to cleave HA tetrasaccharide substituted at the 4-hydroxyl GlcNAc reducing end by BDDE, it is able to degrade CN-BDDE down to disaccharide units.",Spectroscopic and molecular docking studies on the interaction between spermidine and pancreatic elastase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880056,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"In this study, the impact of spermidine on the stability, conformation and activity of elastase was investigated at the pH of 8.5 (the optimum pH for elastase) and different temperatures (303, 313, and 323 K) using UV-vis spectrophotometry, Spectrofluorimetry, circular dichroism, and enzyme activity measurements. The empirical results were obtained and compared with those achieved by the molecular docking simulation. Spectrofluorometric results proved that with the addition of spermidine to the protein solution, the emission severity of elastase was extremely reduced. Further, the Stern-Volmer equation demonstrated that quenching was principally of the static type. Moreover, ∆H0 and ∆S0 showed a negative value, revealing that hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions played a critical role in the interaction between spermidine and elastase. Km and kcat [E] parameters also showed that spermidine acted as an activator for elastase. Far-UV circular dichroism also revealed that spermidine could alter the secondary structure of elastase via a partial increment within the content of the α-helix structure (from 7.8 to 8.6), while it was somewhat diminished in the β-sheet (from 29.4 to 28.8). Molecular docking simulation results also demonstrated that spermidine could bind to porcine elastase, and van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonding interactions played the main role in this binding. Spermidine, therefore, served as a partial stabilizer and an activator for the enzyme.",New chitosan/silica/zinc oxide nanocomposite as adsorbent for dye removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880055,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"Chitosan/silica hybrid was used for zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles immobilization to form chitosan/silica/ZnO nanocomposite.

The best interpretation for the equilibrium data was given by Langmuir isotherm, and the highest adsorption capacity of MB reached to 293.3 mg/g in slight basic medium. As an effective and low-cost adsorbent, chitosan/silica/ZnO nanocomposite is expected to have a promising future for adsorption of organic dyes from their aqueous solutions.",Physicochemical and antioxidant potential of polysaccharides sequentially extracted from Amana edulis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880054,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"Amana edulis polysaccharides (AEPs) specifically HBSS, CHSS, DASS, and CASS were sequentially extracted with four different solvents. The present study characterized the AEPs with particular focus on their physicochemical and anti-oxidant based functional properties.

HBSS showed the maximum solubility, while, CASS was observed for higher foam capacity and foam stability. Among all the fractions, DASS was observed with higher thermal stability. HBSS showed the highest ABTS+ scavenging activity. HBSS and CASS had higher DPPH and OH- scavenging activities. DASS depicted the highest chelation and reducing ability. To summarize, these polysaccharides fractions may be further utilized for their enormous prospective in functional foods preparation.","Characterization of amylose and amylopectin fractions separated from potato, banana, corn, and cassava starches.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880053,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Analytical techniques such HPSEC, DSC, and TGA have been employed for amylose determination in starch samples, though spectrophotometry by iodine binding is most commonly used. The vast majority of these techniques require an analytical curve, using amylose and amylopectin standards with physicochemical properties similar to those found in the original starch. The current study aimed to obtain the amylose and amylopectin fractions from potato, banana, corn, and cassava starches, characterize them, and evaluate their behavior via thermogravimetric curves. Blue amylose iodine complex and HPSEC-DRI methods have obtained high purity amylose and amylopectin fractions. All molecular weights of the obtained amylose and amylopectin fractions were similar to those presented in other reports. Different results were obtained by deconvolution of the amylopectin polymodal distribution. All amyloses presented as semi-crystalline V-type polymorphs, while all amylopectin fractions were amorphous. The Tg of all Vamyloses presented were directly proportional to their respective crystalline index. TGA evaluations have shown that selective precipitation of amylose with 1-butanol strongly changes its thermal behavior. Therefore, the separation procedure used was an ineffective pathway for obtaining standards for thermal studies.","Sustainable elastomers derived from cellulose, rosin and fatty acid by a combination of ""graft from"" RAFT and isocyanate chemistry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880052,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"Utilization of natural sustainable feedstock to fabricate polymers has attracted remarkable attention. In this work, we reported a strategy to prepare a series of grafted copolymers from rosin, fatty acids and ethyl cellulose. The process involved the preparation of EC-based macro-RAFT agent through a simple esterification reaction, followed by a ""grafting from"" reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) of DAGMA (derived from rosin) and LMA (derived from fatty acid) to achieve a class of EC-g-P(DAGMA-co-LMA) graft copolymers with a tunable Tg tuned by the DAGMA/LMA molar ratio. Then, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) was used to crosslink these graft copolymers. The mechanical and dynamic thermo-mechanical properties of tests showed that elastic recovery values of copolymers were enhanced to 90%, as compared to the un-crosslinked samples. Additionally, all these polymers showed an excellent UV absorption performance. This study provides a facile way to fabricate biobased elastomeric materials with improved mechanical properties.",Effect of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions on human serum albumin interaction with plasma unsaturated fatty acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880051,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"Human serum albumin (HSA) serves as a depot and carrier of multiple unrelated ligands including several participants of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid β peptide (Aβ), Zn2+/Cu2+ ions, docosahexaenoic (DHA), linoleic (LA), and oleic (OA) acids. To explore the interplay between HSA interaction with Zn2+/Cu2+ and the plasma unsaturated fatty acids (DHA, LA, OA, and arachidonic acid (ArA)), we have studied the metal dependence of the fatty acid (FA) binding capacity of HSA (nmax) and structural consequences of the HSA-FA interactions. HSA loading with Zn2+ decreases nmax value by 0.3-1.5, while its saturation with Cu2+ causes the FA-dependent nmax changes by up to 0.9. The Cu2+-induced decline in nmax value for DHA is due to conformational rearrangements in HSA molecule. In other cases, the changes in nmax are attributed to steric hindarance/facilitation of the HSA-FA interaction because of the protein multimerization/monomerization, as confirmed by chemical crosslinking. The surface hydrophobicity of HSA is Cu2+-, Zn2+-, and FA-dependent and decreases upon the FA binding, according to bis-ANS fluorescence data. Overall, Zn2+ or Cu2+ binding selectively affect HSA interaction with the FAs studied, in part due to changes in quaternary structure of the protein.",Effects of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 particles on properties of PVA/xylan composite films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880050,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"The effects of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 on the properties of PVA/xylan composite films were investigated in this work. Results showed that nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 could effectively improve the mechanical strength, moisture and oxygen barrier properties and surface hydrophobic property of the composite films. The results of FTIR and XRD indicated the interaction of hydrogen bonds between nanoparticles and PVA and xylan. When the contents of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 in the composite films were 3%, the tensile strength was increased to 20.4 MPa and 22.5 MPa, respectively, while water vapor permeability (3.14 and 3.03 × 10-11 g·m-1·s-1·Pa-1) and oxygen permeability (5.28 and 5.003 cm3·m-2·24 h-1·0.1 MPa-1) reached the minima. With the increase of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 dosage, the solubility of composite films was increased. When the contents of nano-ZnO and nano-SiO2 were 3% and 4%, respectively, the contact angles of the films was increased up to 101° and 78°. Besides, the composite films with nano-ZnO exhibited UV shielding performance, whereas the ones with nano-SiO2 had similar UV light-transparency to the pure PVA/xylan composite films."
