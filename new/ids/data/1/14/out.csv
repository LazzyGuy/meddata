The structure of the rumen flora has a significant effect on methane production. To establish a more accurate prediction model for methane production, the rumen flora should be one of the most important parameters. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship among changes in rumen flora, nutrient levels, and methane production in sheep fed with the diets of different forage-to-concentration ratios, as well as to screen for significantly different dominant genera. Nine rumen-cannulated hybrid sheep were separated into three groups and fed three diets with forage-to-concentration ratios of 50:50, 70:30, and 90:10. Three proportions of the diets were fed according to a 3 × 3 incomplete Latin square, design during three periods of 15d each. The ruminal fluid was collected for real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), high-throughput sequencing and in vitro rumen fermentation in a new real-time fermentation system wit. Twenty-two genera were screened, the abundance of which varied linearly with forage-to-concentration ratios and methane production. In addition, during the 12-hour in vitro fermentation, the appearance of peak concentration was delayed by 26-27min with the different structure of rumen bacteria. The fiber-degrading bacteria were positively correlated with this phenomenon, but starch-degrading and protein-degrading bacteria were negative correlated. These results would facilitate macro-control of rumen microorganisms and better management of diets for improved nutrition in ruminants. In addition, our findings would help in screening bacterial genera that are highly correlated with methane production.","Factors affecting lifetime reproduction, long-term territory-specific reproduction, and estimation of habitat quality in northern goshawks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116756,PloS one,2019 06 10,"One measure of habitat quality is a species' demographic performance in a habitat and the gold standard metric of performance is reproduction. Such a measure, however, may be misleading if individual quality is a fitness determinant. We report on factors affecting lifetime reproduction (LR), the total number of lifetime fledglings produced by an individual, and long-term territory-specific reproduction in a multi-generational study of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis). LR increased with longer lifespans and more breeding attempts and was strongly correlated with the number of recruits in two filial generations indicating that LR was a good fitness predictor. Extensive differences in LR attested to heterogeneity in individual quality, a requisite for the ideal pre-emptive distribution model (IPD) of habitat settling wherein high quality individuals get the best habitats forcing lower quality individuals into poorer habitats with lower reproduction. In response to 7‒9-year prey abundance cycles, annual frequency of territory occupancy by breeders was highly variable and low overall with monotonic increases in vacancies through low prey years. Occupancy of territories by breeders differed from random; some appeared preferred while others were avoided, producing a right-skewed distribution of total territory-specific fledgling production. However, mean fledglings per nest attempt was only slightly lower in less versus more productive territories, and, contrary to IPD predictions of increases in annual territory-specific coefficients of variation (CV) in reproduction as breeder densities increase, the CV of production decreased as density increased. Rather than habitat quality per se, conspecific attraction elicited territory selection by prospecting goshawks as 70% of settlers comprised turnovers on territories, resulting in occupancy continuity and increased territory-specific reproduction. Top-producing territories had as few as 2 long-lived (high LR) and up to 6 short-lived (low LR) sequential breeders. While individual quality appeared to effect territory-specific heterogeneity in reproductive performance, our data suggests that differences in individual quality may be washed-out by a random settling of prospectors in response to conspecific attraction.",Noise-precision tradeoff in predicting combinations of mutations and drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116755,PLoS computational biology,2019 06 04,"Many biological problems involve the response to multiple perturbations. Examples include response to combinations of many drugs, and the effects of combinations of many mutations. Such problems have an exponentially large space of combinations, which makes it infeasible to cover the entire space experimentally. To overcome this problem, several formulae that predict the effect of drug combinations or fitness landscape values have been proposed. These formulae use the effects of single perturbations and pairs of perturbations to predict triplets and higher order combinations. Interestingly, different formulae perform best on different datasets. Here we use Pareto optimality theory to quantitatively explain why no formula is optimal for all datasets, due to an inherent bias-variance (noise-precision) tradeoff. We calculate the Pareto front of log-linear formulae and find that the optimal formula depends on properties of the dataset: the typical interaction strength and the experimental noise. This study provides an approach to choose a suitable prediction formula for a given dataset, in order to best overcome the combinatorial explosion problem.","Trends and projections of universal health coverage indicators in Ghana, 1995-2030: A national and subnational study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116754,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Ghana has made significant stride towards universal health coverage (UHC) by implementing the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2003. This paper investigates the progress of UHC indicators in Ghana from 1995 to 2015 and makes future predictions up to 2030 to assess the probability of achieving UHC targets. National representative surveys of Ghana were used to assess health service coverage and financial risk protection. The analyses estimated the coverage of 13 prevention and four treatment service indicators at the national level and across wealth quintiles. In addition, we calculated catastrophic health payments and impoverishment to assess financial hardship and used a Bayesian regression model to estimate trends and future projections as well as the probabilities of achieving UHC targets by 2030. Wealth-based inequalities and regional disparities were also assessed. At the national level, 14 out of the 17 health service indicators are projected to reach the target of 80% coverage by 2030. Across wealth quintiles, inequalities were observed amongst most indicators with richer groups obtaining more coverage than their poorer counterparts. Subnational analysis revealed while all regions will achieve the 80% coverage target with high probabilities for the prevention services, the same cannot be applied to the treatment services. In 2015, the proportion of households that suffered catastrophic health payments and impoverishment at a threshold of 25% non-food expenditure were 1.9% (95%CrI: 0.9-3.5) and 0.4% (95%CrI: 0.2-0.8), respectively. These are projected to reduce to 0.4% (95% CrI: 0.1-1.3) and 0.2% (0.0-0.5) respectively by 2030. Inequality measures and subnational assessment revealed that catastrophic expenditure experienced by wealth quintiles and regions are not equal. Significant improvements were seen in both health service coverage and financial risk protection over the years. However, inequalities across wealth quintiles and regions continue to be cause of concerns. Further efforts are needed to narrow these gaps.",Endophytic ability of the insecticidal bacterium Brevibacillus laterosporus in Brassica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116753,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Brevibacillus laterosporus (Bl), is an insecticidal bacterium recorded as toxic to a range of invertebrates after ingestion. Isolates of Bl, which were initially recovered from surface-sterilised cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) seeds, were able to colonise brassica plants in the laboratory and field. The bacterium was recovered from surface-sterilised leaf, stem and root sections of seedlings after inoculation with Bl vegetative cells under laboratory conditions, and from mature cabbage plants sprayed with Bl in a field trial. The identity of the recovered bacterial isolates was confirmed by PCR through amplification of 16S rDNA and two strain-specific regions. The effect on diamondback moth (DBM) insect herbivory was tested with cabbage seedlings treated with one isolate (Bl 1951) as the strains are toxic to DBM after direct ingestion. While no effect on DBM larval herbivory was observed, there was a significant reduction of DBM pupation on the Bl 1951 colonised plants. The presence of Bl 1951 wild type cells within cabbage root tissue was confirmed by confocal microscopy, establishing the endophytic nature of the bacterium. The bacterium was also endophytic in three other brassica species tested, Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra), oilseed rape (Brassica napus var. oleifera) and radish (Raphanus sativus).",Time dynamics and invariant subnetwork structures in the world cereals trade network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116751,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The development of industrial agriculture has enabled a sharp increase in food trade at the global scale. Worldwide trade underpins food security by distributing food surpluses to food deficient countries. The study of agricultural product flows can provide insights on the complex interactions between exporting and importing countries and the resulting network structures. Commercial partnerships between countries can be modelled using a complex network approach. Based on the detailed trade matrices from FAO covering the period from 1986 to 2013, we present an analysis of the world cereal trade in terms of weighted and directed networks. The network nodes are the countries and the links are the trades of agricultural products in mass. We reveal the changing topology and degree distribution of the world network during the studied period. We distinguish three entangled subnetwork structures when considering the temporal stability of the trades. The three subnetworks display distinct properties and a differential contribution in total trade. Trades of uninterrupted activity over the 28-year study period compose the backbone network which accounts for two thirds of all traded mass and is scale-free. Inversely, two thirds of the trades only have one or two consecutive years of activity and define the transient subnetwork which displays random growth and accounts for very little traded mass. The trades of intermediate duration display an exponential growth both in numbers and in traded mass and define the intermediate subnetwork. The topology of each subnetwork is a time invariant. The identification of invariant structures is a useful basis for developing prospective agri-food network modelling to assess their resilience to perturbations and shocks.",Comparing the accuracy of PCR-capillary electrophoresis and cuticle microhistological analysis for assessing diet composition in ungulates: A case study with Pyrenean chamois.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116750,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The study of diet composition is required to understand the interactions between animal and plant ecosystems. Different non-invasive techniques applied on faecal samples have commonly been used for such purposes, with cuticle microhistological analysis (CMA) and emerging DNA-based methods being the most relevant. In this work, we refined and optimized a qualitative DNA-based approach combining PCR amplification of long trnL(UAA) and ITS2 fragments and capillary electrophoresis (PCR-CE), instead of short trnL(UAA) fragments and massive sequencing technologies commonly reported. To do so, we developed a controlled diet assay using a stabled Pyrenean chamois specimen (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica), which included representative herbaceous and shrubby plant species. We also assessed the impact of sample freshness on the diet determination of this mountain caprinae by exposing faecal samples to the outdoor environment for three weeks. Faecal samples from both experiments were analysed by qualitative PCR-CE and semi-quantitative CMA in order to compare the pros and cons of both approaches. Our results show that all of the offered plant species were detected by both methodologies although CMA over-detected shrubs compared to herbaceous species. At the same time, sample degradation due to sustained climate exposure is a limiting factor for molecular analysis, but not for CMA. Taken all together, our results suggest that the qualitative information obtained by CMA and PCR-CE can be interchangeable when faecal samples are fresh (less than one week after deposition) but, afterwards, molecular analysis underestimates diet composition probably due to DNA degradation. CMA, however, can accurately be used at least three weeks after defecation. Moreover, by combining the results of simultaneous PCR amplification of two complementary genes, this optimized PCR-CE methodology provides a reliable, feasible and more affordable alternative for multiple and routine analyses of complex samples. Neither CMA nor PCR-CE seems to solve comprehensively the quatification of herbivore diets and thus further research needs to be done.",Reconstruction and inference of the Lactococcus lactis MG1363 gene co-expression network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116749,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Lactic acid bacteria are Gram-positive bacteria used throughout the world in many industrial applications for their acidification, flavor and texture formation attributes. One of the species, Lactococcus lactis, is employed for the production of fermented milk products like cheese, buttermilk and quark. It ferments lactose to lactic acid and, thus, helps improve the shelf life of the products. Many physiological and transcriptome studies have been performed in L. lactis in order to comprehend and improve its biotechnological assets. Using large amounts of transcriptome data to understand and predict the behavior of biological processes in bacterial or other cell types is a complex task. Gene networks enable predicting gene behavior and function in the context of transcriptionally linked processes. We reconstruct and present the gene co-expression network (GCN) for the most widely studied L. lactis strain, MG1363, using publicly available transcriptome data. Several methods exist to generate and judge the quality of GCNs. Different reconstruction methods lead to networks with varying structural properties, consequently altering gene clusters. We compared the structural properties of the MG1363 GCNs generated by five methods, namely Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, GeneNet, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation (SPACE). Using SPACE, we generated an L. lactis MG1363 GCN and assessed its quality using modularity and structural and biological criteria. The L. lactis MG1363 GCN has structural properties similar to those of the gold-standard networks of Escherichia coli K-12 and Bacillus subtilis 168. We showcase that the network can be used to mine for genes with similar expression profiles that are also generally linked to the same biological process.","The keys to learning for university students with disabilities: Motivation, emotion and faculty-student relationships.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116748,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The affective-emotional dimension may constitute a key element in teaching and learning processes. It is linked to relationship between faculty and students and may help foster students with disabilities' motivation to learn and remain at university. This is the approach adopted in this article, which aims to fill a gap detected in the literature, since very little attention has hitherto been paid to motivation, emotion and the importance of faculty-student relationships in the learning processes of students with disabilities. In this study, 119 faculty members from 10 Spanish universities who engage in inclusive practices in all areas of knowledge recounted, in response to questions asked during a semi-structured interview, how they motivated and related to their students. The conclusion reached is that students with disabilities are more motivated than their fellow classmates, meaning that very few extra actions need to be taken to engage them in the learning process. Nevertheless, participants reported having a knowledge of strategies based on motivation and emotion and using them to develop a sense of belonging among students, thus fostering their learning."

A common feature of these strains is their conservation in permafrost, from which they were extracted either due to the thawing of permafrost (Yamal strains) or as the result of paleontological excavations (Yakut strains). All strains isolated on the Yamal share an identical genotype belonging to lineage B.Br.001/002, pointing to a common source of infection in a territory over 250 km in length. In contrast, during the excavations in Yakutia, three genetically different strains were recovered from a single pit. One strain belongs to B.Br.001/002, and whole genome sequence analysis showed that it is most closely related to the Yamal strains in spite of the remoteness of Yamal from Yakutia. The two other strains contribute to two different branches of A.Br.008/011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in the B. anthracis species. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to A.Br.008/011 is suggesting that the polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe. We propose an evolutionary model for B. anthracis recent evolution in which the B lineage spread throughout Eurasia and was subsequently replaced by the A lineage except in some geographically isolated areas.",FEM analysis in excellent cushion characteristic of ostrich (Struthio camelus) toe pads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116736,PloS one,2019 06 10,"African ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest and fastest extent bipedal animal. The ostrich mainly relies on the 3rd toe to support the entire body under high-speed motion. The short and severe impact concentrated on the limited area would produce tremendous momentary internal stress and strain, which may contribute to the phalanges disloaction, soft tissue damage and the like. The vibration and excessive negative acceleration caused by the ground reaction force also affect the stability of the touching process. Therefore, ostrich toe pads are required to have excellent cushion characteristics. However, current studies often explains the cushion properties by analyzing the macro-microscopic structure of the pad organism, and there is a paucity of research on its biomechanical behaviour. Consequently, from the perspective of multi-layer structure and biomaterial assembly, this study aims to explain the biomechanical characteristics of the ostrich toe pads by FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis. Based on results, we deem that the ostrich toe pad could absorb energy and reduce vibration effectively. Firstly, the multi-layer structure of the pads make the stress and strain decay from outside to inside. Secondly, the minimal response frequency of the pad is 164.22 Hz, making it effectively avoid resonance phenomenon. Finally, the composite material model has the best performance in decreasing the negative acceleration peak value, the impact force peak value and the maximal equivalent stress value at velocities of 0.669 m/s and 1.339 m/s. These results help to further understand the buffer mechanism of the ostrich toe pad, and also have important inter-species reference value for the pathogenesis of human foot soft tissue injury.",What can we learn from the hair of the dog? Complex effects of endogenous and exogenous stressors on canine hair cortisol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116735,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Hair is an emerging biological matrix in which to measure chronic HPA axis activity, offering a longer term view into an animal's life. We explored effects of exogenous (e.g. lifestyle, medications, social environment) and endogenous (e.g. disease, behaviour) stressors on hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in a population of Border Collies (BCs). Owners of BCs were recruited and reported their dog's lifestyle, clinical history, anxiety-related behaviour, and collected a white hair sample from their dog's dorsal neck region. HCC was determined using established methods with a commercial cortisol assay kit. Samples from 135 BCs were analysed, with 91 healthy controls and 44 diagnosed with epilepsy as a model disease. Factors associated with higher HCC included psychosocial stressors (living with three or more other dogs) and lifestyle (engaging in competitive flyball); while factors associated with lower HCC included anxiety (stranger-directed and non-social), health (epilepsy diagnosis, with number of seizures to date negatively correlated with HCC) and medication (certain anti-epileptic drugs were associated with elevated or reduced HCC). These novel results highlight the potential of chronic stress with frequent or persisting HPA-axis hyperactivity leading to a state of hypocortisolism, and the need to consider stressor recency and recurrence when interpreting HCC data.",CBX2 is required to stabilize the testis pathway by repressing Wnt signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116734,PLoS genetics,2019 06 04,"XX and XY fetal gonads are initially bipotential, poised between the ovary and testis fate. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that commitment to testis fate requires the repression of genes associated with ovary fate. It was previously shown that loss of CBX2, the subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that binds H3K27me3 and mediates silencing, leads to ovary development in XY mice and humans. While it had been proposed that CBX2 is an activator of the testis-determining gene Sry, we investigated the alternative possibility that CBX2 has a direct role as a repressor of the antagonistic ovary-promoting pathway. To investigate this possibility, we developed a quantitative genome-wide profile of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and its active counterpart H3K4me3 in isolated XY and XX gonadal supporting cells before and after sex determination. We show that testis and ovary sex-determining (SD) genes are bivalent before sex determination, providing insight into how the bipotential state of the gonad is established at the epigenetic level. After sex determination, many SD genes of the alternate pathway remain bivalent, possibly contributing to the ability of these cells to transdifferentiate even in adults. The finding that many genes in the Wnt signaling pathway were targeted for H3K27me3-mediated repression in Sertoli cells led us to test whether deletion of Wnt4 could rescue testis development in Cbx2 mutants. We show that Sry expression and testis development were rescued in XY Cbx2-/-;Wnt4-/- mice. Furthermore, we show that CBX2 directly binds the downstream Wnt signaler Lef1, an ovary-promoting gene that remains bivalent in Sertoli cells. Our results suggest that stabilization of the testis fate requires CBX2-mediated repression of bivalent ovary-determining genes, which would otherwise block testis development.",The dPix-Git complex is essential to coordinate epithelial morphogenesis and regulate myosin during Drosophila egg chamber development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116733,PLoS genetics,2019 06 07,"How biochemical and mechanical information are integrated during tissue development is a central question in morphogenesis. In many biological systems, the PIX-GIT complex localises to focal adhesions and integrates both physical and chemical information. We used Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber formation to study the function of PIX and GIT orthologues (dPix and Git, respectively), and discovered a central role for this complex in controlling myosin activity and epithelial monolayering. We found that Git's focal adhesion targeting domain mediates basal localisation of this complex to filament structures and the leading edge of migrating cells. In the absence of dpix and git, tissue disruption is driven by contractile forces, as reduction of myosin activators restores egg production and morphology. Further, dpix and git mutant eggs closely phenocopy defects previously reported in pak mutant epithelia. Together, these results indicate that the dPix-Git complex controls egg chamber morphogenesis by controlling myosin contractility and Pak kinase downstream of focal adhesions.",A bioeconomic model for the optimization of local canine rabies control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116732,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 06 04,"We present a new modeling tool that can be used to maximize the impact of canine rabies management resources that are available at the local level. The model is accessible through a web-based interface that allows for flexibility in the management strategies that can be investigated. Rabies vaccination, sterilization, chemo-contraception, and euthanasia can be specified and limited to specific demographic groups. Additionally, we allowed for considerable complexity in the specification of management costs. In many areas, the costs of contacting additional dogs increases as management effort increases, and this can have important strategic implications. We illustrated the application of the model by examining several alternative management strategies in an area of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Our results based on this dog population suggested that puppies should be vaccinated and sterilization would not be optimal if the spatial extent of management is not large (and perhaps not even then).

Serum type I collagen C terminal peptide (CTX_1), procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) were tested along with the femur bone density and other properties, including bone mineral density (BMD), BALP, percent trabecular area (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (TbN), maximum load, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus. BMD, BALP, BV/TV, Tb.Th, TbN, maximum load, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus values were higher in the BMMSC group versus the ALN group relative to the control group (p < 0.05); CTX_1, PINP, trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and osteoclast number (OC.N) were lowest in the BMMSC group versus the ALN group relative to the control group (p < 0.05). Both BMMSCs and ALN could improve the metabolic function and bone quality in osteoporotic mice while restoring the strength and toughness of bones. The intervention effects of BMMSCs are better than ALN in this model.",The microtubule skeleton and the evolution of neuronal complexity in vertebrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116700,Biological chemistry,2019 06 14,"The evolution of a highly developed nervous system is mirrored by the ability of individual neurons to develop increased morphological complexity. As microtubules (MTs) are crucially involved in neuronal development, we tested the hypothesis that the evolution of complexity is driven by an increasing capacity of the MT system for regulated molecular interactions as it may be implemented by a higher number of molecular players and a greater ability of the individual molecules to interact. We performed bioinformatics analysis on different classes of components of the vertebrate neuronal MT cytoskeleton. We show that the number of orthologs of tubulin structure proteins, MT-binding proteins and tubulin-sequestering proteins expanded during vertebrate evolution. We observed that protein diversity of MT-binding and tubulin-sequestering proteins increased by alternative splicing. In addition, we found that regions of the MT-binding protein tau and MAP6 displayed a clear increase in disorder extent during evolution. The data provide evidence that vertebrate evolution is paralleled by gene expansions, changes in alternative splicing and evolution of coding sequences of components of the MT system. The results suggest that in particular evolutionary changes in tubulin-structure proteins, MT-binding proteins and tubulin-sequestering proteins were prominent drivers for the development of increased neuronal complexity.",[Consensus on acute ischemic stroke].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116699,Medicina,2019 06 05,"Stroke is the third cause of death and the first cause of disability in Argentina.

Part A,2019 06 14,"Exposure to mold-contaminated indoor air has been associated with various respiratory diseases, and there is a need for experimental data to confirm these associations. The pro-inflammatory properties of well-characterized aerosolized spores and hyphal fragments from Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus versicolor were examined and compared using various human macrophage cell models including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophages (THP-1 Ma), primary peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and primary airway macrophages (AM) from induced sputum. X-ray treated samples of the two mold species induced different responses with A. fumigatus displaying the most potent induction of pro-inflammatory responses. While hyphal fragments from A. fumigatus were more potent than spores, similar responses were produced by the two growth stages of A. versicolor. THP-1 Ma was the most sensitive model releasing a broad range of cytokines/chemokines. MDM exhibited a similar cytokine/chemokine profile as THP-1 Ma, except for a low-quantity release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). In contrast, AM appeared to be nonresponsive and yielded a different pattern of pro-inflammatory markers. Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, but also to a certain degree TLR2, was involved in several responses induced by spores and aerosolized hyphal fragments of A. fumigatus in MDM. Taken together, MDM seems to be the most promising experimental macrophage model.

This growing field has revolutionized our understanding of host-pathogen interactions, revealing new insights into the host response to influenza infection and vaccination. Studies using transcriptomics have identified a unique immunosignature for influenza discernable from other bacterial and viral pathogens, key transcriptional factors that discriminate early from late, mild versus severe, and symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection. Recent studies evaluating the host response to influenza vaccines have revealed key differences in live versus inactivated influenza vaccines, identified early transcriptional signatures that predict hemagglutinin antibody production following vaccination, increased our understanding of how adjuvants enhance the immune response to influenza vaccine antigens, and demonstrate biologic variability in the response to vaccination due to host factors.

Likewise, in cases of congenital limb absence there is evidence that limited afferent or efferent activity affects the structural integrity of white matter pathways serving the affected side. Evidence that the structural integrity of mature sensory and motor tracts controlling the lost upper limb exhibits similar activity-dependence is, however, sparse and inconsistent. Here we used diffusion tensor tractography to test whether amputation of the dominant right hand during adulthood (N=16) alters the microstructural integrity of the major sensory (medial lemniscus, ML) and motor (corticospinal tract, CST) pathways controlling missing hand function. Consistent with prior findings, healthy controls (N=27) exhibited higher fractional anisotropy (FA) -an index of white matter microstructural integrity- within dominant left CST and non-dominant right ML. Critically, in contrast to what might be expected if the microstructural organization of these tracts is activity-dependent, these asymmetries persisted in amputees. Moreover,we failed to detect any differences in dominant left ML or CST between healthy controls and amputees. Our results are consistent with these white matter tracts being robust to changes in activity once mature, or that continued use of the residual limb (in a compensatory fashion or using prostheses) provides stimulation sufficient to maintain tracts integrity.",Innovating to increase access to diabetes care in Kenya: an evaluation of Novo Nordisk's base of the pyramid project.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116677,Global health action,2019 06 10,"Background: The Base of the Pyramid (BoP) project is a public-private partnership initiated by Novo Nordisk that aims to facilitate access to diabetes care for people at the base of the economic pyramid in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Kenya, the BoP, through a partnership model, aims to strengthen five pillars of diabetes care: increased awareness of diabetes; early diagnosis of diabetes; access to quality care by trained professionals; stable and affordable insulin supply; and improved self-management through patient education. Objectives: This study evaluates the extent to which BoP Kenya is scalable and sustainable, whether stakeholders share in its value, and whether BoP Kenya has improved access to diabetes care. Method: The Rapid Assessment Protocol for Insulin Access (RAPIA), an approach developed to provide a broad situational analysis of diabetes care, was used to examine health infrastructure and diabetes care pathways in Kenya. At the national level, the RAPIA was applied in a SWOT analysis of the BoP through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. At individual and county health system levels, RAPIA was adapted to explore the impact of the BoP on access to diabetes care through a comparison of an intervention and control county. Results: The BoP was implemented in 28 of 47 counties in Kenya. Meru, a county where BoP was implemented, had 35 of 62 facilities (56%) participating in the BoP. Of the five pillars of the BoP, most notable progress was made in achieving the fourth (stable and affordable insulin supply). A price ceiling of 500KSh (US$5) per vial of insulin was established in the intervention county, with greater fluctuation and stock-outs in the non-intervention county. Despite reduced insulin costs, many patients with diabetes could not afford the additive expenses of monitoring, medicines, and travel. Less progress was made over the other pillars, which also faced challenges to sustainability and scalability. Conclusion: In the context of the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases in LMICs, cross-sector approaches to improving access to care are increasingly needed. Public-private partnerships such as the BoP are necessary but not sufficient to ensure access to health care for people with diabetes at the base of the economic pyramid in Kenya.",Treatment and Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of Incidental Pulmonary Embolism in Patients With Cancer: An International Prospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116676,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2019 06 10,"Pulmonary embolism is incidentally diagnosed in up to 5% of patients with cancer on routine imaging scans.

Furthermore, we expected that specific individuals (e.g. romantic partners and family members) would be associated with less drinking. Data were provided from 372 drinkers who logged daily drinking and the presence of network members on MTurk. Results indicated consistent support for the number of network members present as a predictor of the number of drinks consumed per drinking day, regardless of member characteristics.

Unlike other Candida species, C. auris has acquired high levels of resistance to an already limited arsenal of antifungals. As an emerging pathogen, there are currently a limited number of documented murine models of C. auris infection. These animal models use inoculums as high as 107-108 cells per mouse, and the environmental and occupational exposure of working with these models has not been clearly defined. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture, we monitored the animal holding room as well as the procedure room for up to 6 months while working with an intravenous model of C. auris infection. This study determined that shedding of the organism is dose-dependent, as detectable levels of C. auris were detected in the cage bedding when mice were infected with 107 and 108 cells, but not with doses of 105 and 106 cells. Autoclaving bedding in closed micro-isolator cages was found to be an effective way to minimize exposure for animal caretakers. We found that tissue necropsies of infected mice were also an important source of potential source exposure to C. auris. To mitigate these potential exposures, we implemented a rigorous ""buddy system"" workflow and a disinfection protocol that uses 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol and can be used in any animal facility when using small animal models of C. auris infection.",The Repeatability of Values Measured Using the Spot Vision Screener in Healthy Children and Children with Refractive Errors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116670,Journal of binocular vision and ocular motility,2019 06 11,"Purpose: To determine the repeatability of refractive values measured using the Spot vision screener in healthy children and children with refractive errors. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 170 eyes of 85 healthy children (normal group), and 50 eyes of 25 children wearing spectacles for refractive errors (spectacles group). The spherical equivalent value, cylindrical value, and inter-ocular differences in the spherical equivalent values were analyzed. The repeatability of the refractive values measured using the Spot vision screener was determined using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% limits of agreement. Results: In the normal group, ICC values for the spherical equivalent value, cylindrical value, and amount of anisometropia were 0.77, 0.80, and 0.64, respectively. In the spectacles group with spectacles they were 0.89, 0.67, and 0.78, respectively. In the spectacles group without spectacles they were 0.96, 0.78, and 0.97, respectively. The 95% limits of agreement between consecutive measurements for the spherical equivalent value, cylindrical value, and amount of anisometropia were within ±1.00 D in the normal group and the spectacles group with spectacles, and over ±1.00 D in the spectacles group without spectacles. Conclusions: The Spot vision screener can ensure better than moderate repeatability with and without spectacles."

The catalyst maintained a relatively high removal rate (>85%) over 5 cycles and degradation intermediates are detected on the catalyst surface after cycled via XPS analysis. The degradation mechanism was investigated by quenching experiments and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance technology. The surface-bound ·OH and SO4·- are considered as the main active radicals in the degradation process. The composite of CFA@MnO2 provides a low-cost and efficient alternative for the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants.","The Economics of Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: A Review of the Effects on Prices, Sales, Cross-Border Shopping, and Consumption.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116649,Annual review of nutrition,2019 05 22,"During the past decade, dozens of countries, regions, and cities have enacted taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). They have been primarily motivated by a desire to raise prices, reduce sales and consumption, improve population health, and raise revenue. This review outlines the economic rationale for SSB taxes and illustrates their predicted effects. It reviews the research on the effects of these taxes on retail prices, sales, cross-border shopping, consumption, and product availability. The evidence indicates that the amount by which taxes increase retail prices (also called the pass-through of the tax) varies by jurisdiction, ranging from less than 50% to 100% of the tax. Sales tend to decrease significantly in the taxing jurisdiction, although this seems to be partly offset by residents increasingly shopping outside of the taxing jurisdiction (i.e., engaging in cross-border shopping). Overall, taxes lower consumption of the taxed beverages by adults, although not for all types of beverages or all groups of consumers. We conclude with suggestions for improving the design of such taxes and directions for future research.

Convergent extension is a particularly important morphogenetic process to which George Oster gave significant attention. Late elongation of the sea urchin archenteron is a classic example of convergent extension in a monolayed tube, which has been proposed to be driven by extrinsic axial tension due to the activity of secondary mesenchyme cells. Using a vertex-based mechanical model we show that key features of archenteron elongation can be accounted for by passive cell rearrangement due to applied tension. The model mimics the cell elongation and the Poisson effect (necking) that occur in actual archenterons. We also show that, as predicted by the model, ablation of secondary mesenchyme cells late in archenteron elongation does not result in extensive elastic recoil. Moreover, blocking the addition of cells to the base of the archenteron late in archenteron elongation leads to excessive cell rearrangement consistent with tension-induced rearrangement of a smaller cohort of cells. Our mechanical simulation suggests that responsive rearrangement can account for key features of archenteron elongation and provides a useful starting point for designing future experiments to examine the mechanical properties of the archenteron.

A total of 2144 subjects aged 0-76 years old were selected using a multi-stage stratified sampling method. Socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination history, and disease history of measles were collected by questionnaire. Serum samples were tested for measles-specific IgG by using commercial ELISA kits. The overall seropositivity rate of measles was 79.80% (95% CI 78.1-81.5%) and standardized seropositivity rate was 84.61% (95% CI 84.12-87.10%), with the median concentration of 773.40IU/L. The area of Beijing with the highest seroprevalence was the central area [81.79% (95% CI 80.16-83.42%) and 855.84IU/L]. There were no significant differences in seropositivity rates of different genders (P = 0.074), history of measles infection (P = 0.421) and registered population (P = 0.598). The 1-4 age group had the highest seropositivity rate [94.06%(95% CI 93.06-95.06%)] and children below the age of 1 (0-12 months) had the lowest seropositivity rate [34.42% (95% CI 32.41-36.43%)]. The 30-34 and 35-39 age groups were relatively lower with 72.90% (95% CI 71.02-74.78%) and 74.65% (95% CI 72.81-76.49%) respectively. Seropositivity rates changed along with the incidence rates of measles periodically by years. As shown in the present study, the seroprevalence of measles antibody in Beijing have not yet met the threshold required to achieve measles elimination and therefore the risk of an epidemic of measles will be existing. Appropriate targeted immunization strategies and measures should be considered and carried out.","HPV Vaccination Knowledge, Intentions, and Practices among Caregivers of Childhood Cancer Survivors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116634,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 22,"The HPV vaccine is an important vaccine for childhood cancer survivors because of their risks of second cancers, yet few survivors receive it. We examined HPV vaccine knowledge among caregivers of childhood cancer survivors, whether their child had received the vaccine, and their intentions to vaccinate. Eligible participants were caregivers (mostly parents) whose child finished cancer treatment at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah 3 to 36 months prior to the start of the study (N=145). Additional analyses were done among caregivers whose child was age-eligible for the HPV vaccine (ages 11 and up; N=61). We ran descriptive statistics and fit multivariable generalized linear models to identify factors associated with intention to vaccinate and HPV vaccination uptake. Among all caregivers, approximately 30% stated they were not likely to get the HPV vaccine for their child and the most commonly cited reason was lack of information (20.7%). Provider discussion about vaccines and side effects (relative risk (RR=1.85, 95% CI 1.16-2.94), along with recommendations regarding vaccines after cancer treatment (RR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.72), led to greater caregiver intention to get the HPV vaccine for their child with cancer. Approximately 40% of age-eligible survivors had gotten at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. Our findings demonstrate a need for oncology-focused interventions to educate families of childhood cancer survivors about the importance of the HPV vaccine after cancer therapy.","The indications and safety of polyvalent immunoglobulin for post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A, rubella and measles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116633,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 22,"Derived from pooled blood donations, polyvalent immunoglobulins are used for post-exposure prophylaxis as one aspect of the public health management of hepatitis A, rubella and measles. This review summarises the safety profile of these blood products and the current recommendations for their use for the prevention of hepatitis A, rubella and measles among people who have been exposed to these diseases. The current recommendations are drawn from the most recent publicly available national guidelines of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom as accessed in February 2019.",Prophylactic and therapeutic protection of human IgG purified from sera containing anti-exotoxin A titers against pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116632,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 22,"Antibodies are effective alternative tools to combat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), especially multi-drug-resistant PA. Thus, to solve the urgent need for an anti-PA antibody drug, we hypothesized that anti-PA intravenous immunoglobulins could be a practical attempt. Exotoxin A (ETA) is one of the most important factors for PA infection and is also a critical target for the development of immune interventions. In this study, a total of 320 sera were collected from healthy volunteers. The concentration of ETA-specific antibodies was determined by a Luminex-based assay and then purified by affinity chromatography. The purified IgGs were able to neutralize the cytotoxicity of ETA in vitro. We showed they had a prophylactic and therapeutic protective effect in PA pneumonia and ETA toxemia models. In addition, administration of nonspecific IgGs also provided partial protection. Collectively, our results provide additional evidence for IVIG-based treatment of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant PA and suggest that patients at high risk of PA pneumonia could be prophylactically treated with anti-ETA IgGs or even with nonspecific IgGs.",Challenges in implementing yearly enhanced safety surveillance of influenza vaccination in Europe: lessons learned and future perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116631,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 22,"Seasonal influenza vaccines are frequently reformulated, leading to specific challenges for continuous benefit/risk monitoring. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency started requiring annual enhanced safety surveillance (ESS). This article provides a perspective on ESS studies conducted ever since and aims to map existing initiatives used to monitor adverse events following influenza immunization. Of 11 ESS studies, reporting surveillance data of at least five different vaccine brands during four seasons, all were able to rapidly capture vaccine-specific adverse events of interest reports. However, challenges have been identified during study implementation, including recruitment of sufficient participants, enrolling younger age groups, collecting data of vaccine batch numbers, comparing observed with expected rates and achieving adequate return of reported events. Harmonizing safety monitoring standards across countries, and bridging between routine pharmacovigilance and ESS, is likely to allow more comprehensive assessments of influenza vaccine safety, requiring close collaboration between regulators, public health, and manufacturers.",Locomotor kinematics and EMG activity during quadrupedal vs. bipedal gait in the Japanese macaque.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116630,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 22,"Several qualitative features distinguish bipedal from quadrupedal locomotion in mammals. Here we show quantitative differences between quadrupedal and bipedal gait in the Japanese monkey in terms of gait patterns, trunk/hindlimb kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity, obtained from three macaques during treadmill walking. We predicted that, as a consequence of an almost upright body axis, bipedal gait would show properties consistent with temporal and spatial optimization countering higher trunk/hindlimb loads and a less stable center of mass (CoM). A comparatively larger step width, a ~9% longer duty cycle and ~20% increased relative duration of the double support phase were all in line with such a strategy. Bipedal joint kinematics showed strongest differences in proximal, and least in distal hindlimb joint excursions compared to quadrupedal gait. Hindlimb joint coordination (cyclograms) revealed more periods of single-joint rotations during bipedal gait, and predominance of proximal joints during single-support. The CoM described a symmetrical, quasi-sinusoidal left/right path during bipedal gait, with an alternating shift toward the weight-supporting limb during stance. Trunk/hindlimb EMG activity was non- uniformally increased during bipedal gait: most prominently in proximal antigravity muscles during stance (up to 10-fold). Non-antigravity hindlimb EMG showed altered temporal profiles during lift-off or touchdown. Muscle co-activation was more, but muscle synergies less frequent during bipedal gait. Together, this shows that behavioral and EMG properties of bipedal vs. quadrupedal gait are quantitatively distinct, and suggests that the neural control of bipedal primate locomotion underwent specific adaptations to generate these particular behavioral features to counteract increased load and instability.",Research and development of mAb drugs in China: a look from policy perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116629,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 22,"Background: Monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs are increasingly important for the pharmaceutical industry across the globe. In China, mAb drug developments face many challenges. Multiple policies have been implemented recently to reinforce support in various areas. This study aims to investigate the latest landscape of mAb drugs in China from policy perspectives encompassing R&D, clinical trials, marketing approval, and talent pools. Methods: Information about mAb drugs approved in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and China by 2017 and mAb-related policies in China were retrieved from government websites and third-party statistical databases for descriptive, statistical, and comparative analysis. Results and discussion: In China, 21 mAb drugs (10 locally-developed and 11 imported) have so far been approved. For the 11 imported mAb drugs in China, the median drug lag in the marketing approval was estimated at 87.1 months, compared with the U.S. (0 months), the EU (8.9 months), and Japan (43.4 months). However, as far as the dramatically changing innovation supporting system in China is concerned, emergence of new biopharmaceutical companies, transformation of the current drug companies and their shift to antibody therapy, and the pooling of high-level talent contribute to mAb development in China. The number of clinical trials and marketing applications and approvals involving mAb drugs is also growing. Favorable policies will continue to play a role in the sustainable development of mAb drugs in China. Conclusion: The research showed that the reform of multiple policies and incentives for attracting/retaining high-level talent has evidently been effective in addressing the drug lag of mAb drugs in China. In future development, China should actively monitor the global R&D outcomes and industrial development trends of mAb drugs and make the policy environment more attractive to enable more mAb drugs to be marketed in China as soon as possible.",Potential for enriching next-generation health-promoting gut bacteria through prebiotics and other dietary components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116628,Gut microbes,2019 05 22,"The human intestinal commensal microbiota and associated metabolic products have long been regarded as contributors to host health. As the identity and activities of the various members of this community have become clearer, newly identified health-associated bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus bromii and Roseburia species, have emerged. Notably, the abundance of many of these bacteria is inversely correlated to several disease states. While technological and regulatory hurdles may limit the use of strains from these taxa as probiotics, it should be possible to utilize prebiotics and other dietary components to selectively enhance their growth in situ. Dietary components of potential relevance include well-established prebiotics, such as galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin, while other putative prebiotics, such as other oligosaccharides, polyphenols, resistant starch, algae and seaweed as well as host gut metabolites such as lactate and acetate, may also be applied with the aim of selectively and/or differentially affecting the beneficial bacterial community within the gastrointestinal environment. The present review provides an overview of the dietary components that could be applied in this manner.",HMGA1 negatively regulates NUMB expression at transcriptional and post transcriptional level in glioblastoma stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116627,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 06 15,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal, fast-growing brain cancer, affecting 2-3 per 100,000 adults per year. It arises from multipotent neural stem cells which have reduced their ability to divide asymmetrically and hence divide symmetrically, generating increasing number of cancer stem cells, fostering tumor growth. We have previously demonstrated that the architectural transcription factor HMGA1 is highly expressed in brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and that its silencing increases stem cell quiescence, reduces self-renewal and sphere-forming efficiency in serial passages, suggesting a shift from symmetric to asymmetric division. Since NUMB expression is fundamental for the fulfillment of asymmetric division in stem cells, and is lost or reduced in many tumors, including GBM, we have investigated the ability of HMGA1 to regulate NUMB expression. Here, we show that HMGA1 negatively regulates NUMB expression at transcriptional level, by binding its promoter and counteracting c/EBP-β and at posttranscriptional level, by regulating the expression of MSI1 and of miR-146a. Finally, we report that HMGA1 knockdown-induced NUMB upregulation leads to the downregulation of the NOTCH1 pathway. Therefore, the data reported here indicate that HMGA1 negatively regulates NUMB expression in BTSCs, further supporting HMGA1 targeting as innovative and effective anti-cancer therapy.",Parallel modulation of interhemispheric inhibition and the size of a cortical hand muscle representation during active contraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116626,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 22,"Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between motor cortices is thought to suppress unwanted mirror movements during voluntary behaviors and can be assessed using paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The magnitude of IHI may be related to the size of the cortical representation for a given muscle as a mechanism for facilitating unimanual control. To date, the relationship between IHI and cortical muscle representations remains unknown. Fifteen healthy, right-handed individuals participated in the present study. IHI was examined in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle by delivering conditioning TMS to ipsilateral (right) primary motor cortex (M1) followed by a test TMS pulse to contralateral (left) M1. The size of the FDI representation in M1 was determined by delivering suprathreshold TMS over a 5x5 cm grid centered on the FDI motor hotspot of the left M1. Both IHI and cortical territory were obtained during three conditions: rest, contralateral (right) FDI contraction, and ipsilateral (left) FDI contraction. Results indicate a significant association between IHI and the size of the FDI representation only in the context of contraction and not when the FDI muscle was relaxed. Specifically, reduced IHI corresponded to larger cortical FDI representations during both contralateral and ipsilateral contraction. These data demonstrate that, for a muscle of the hand, the magnitude of IHI and the cortical territory are associated within the context of muscle contraction."

Language is the key to success in every school subject. Therefore, optimal language learning environments are important. Poor sound environments affect teachers' vocal health, their general well-being, and students' performance. To provide better conditions for teachers and students, it is necessary to combine optimized room acoustics with other preventive measures such as vocal training and evidence-based tools to improve classroom communication. Teachers play a key role in the classroom and need knowledge and skills in communicative strategies to ensure first-class communication. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of an intervention program for primary-school teachers comprising strategies for enhanced language learning and interactions in the classroom, with focus on teachers' verbal and body communication (voice, gaze, and gesture). Methods: Teachers (n = 25) from seven schools teaching in school year 3-6 participated. Assessments were made pre/post intervention and at 5-weeks and 3-months follow-up. The assessments included teachers' self-assessments (questionnaires) of vocal health, self-efficacy, stress, burnout, and psychosocial work-environment. Results: The main results were significant decrease in voice problems at the 3-months follow-up and significant decrease of both stress and degree of burnout at 5-weeks follow-up. Self-efficacy score had increased significantly at 5-week follow-up. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the intervention program improves teachers' self-reported vocal health, decreases their perception of stress, and degree of burnout whilst increasing their sense of self-efficacy in classroom management.","Using Behavioral Approaches to Assess Memory, Imitation and Motor Performance in Children with Angelman Syndrome: Results of a Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116614,Developmental neurorehabilitation,2019 05 22,"Purpose: This study was designed to assess memory, imitation of motor actions and motor performance by 12 children (age range 40-151 months) with Angelman syndrome (AS), a rare neurogenetic disorder associated with learning and memory impairments. Methods: Children's functioning was assessed at several time points over a 3-month period. Results: Memory and motor performance tests had acceptable test-retest and inter-rater reliability whereas the motor imitation test did not. Children were able to recall action sequences after a 24-h delay. Memory and motor performance scores were correlated with children's chronological age and raw scores on subdomains of the Vineland-II. Conclusions: These behavioral tests require further development and evaluation but may show promise to accompany standardized assessments that are currently in use with children with AS.",Surgical repair for transverse facial cleft: two flaps with a superiorly rotated single Z-plasty lateral to the commissure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116613,Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,2019 05 22,"Various techniques have been performed for repairing transverse facial clefts. This study aimed to investigate an optimal method for repairing transverse facial clefts. Twenty-seven patients from 2008 to 2017 were evaluated. Their mean age at repair was 6.7 months with a follow-up period of 6 months to 10 years. A method using an inferior lip-based triangular mucosa flap and a superior lip-based rectangular vermilion-mucosa flap was designed for transposition. The orbicularis oris was reconstructed by using everting mattress suture. The skin was sutured using linear cutaneous closure with a single superiorly rotated Z-plasty lateral to the commissure. A postoperative symmetrical commissure was obtained owing to complete contraction with the new commissure directed 2 or 3 mm medial to the symmetrical point on the lips individually for the 27 patients. Lateral displacement of the reconstructed commissure was not observed. The patients showed a plump and symmetrical cheek on the cleft side. Twenty-one patients with hemifacial microsomia achieved a prominent improvement compared with their preoperative appearance, although the postoperative cheeks still did not show fullness because of the lesser facial tissue on the cleft side. In the early follow-up period, most patients showed a minimal scar during movement. However, the scar became thinner and symmetrical oral movement was achieved over time. This method obtained a natural oral movement without a conspicuous scar and was reliable and remarkable for the postoperative appearance of commissural symmetry. We conclude that this is an optimal method to repair transverse facial clefts.",Dual Defibrillation is Highly Variable: An Analysis of Pulse Interval Delivered in Dual Defibrillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116612,Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,2019 06 14,"Background: Dual defibrillation (DD) is a technique where two external defibrillators are applied with two different pad configurations and discharged to treat refractory ventricular fibrillation (RVF). Although commonly called dual sequential defibrillation (DSD), if the delivered electrical pulses overlap with no pulse interval, the shocks are actually dual simultaneous defibrillation (DSiD). Manual DD technique is not standardized and the effect that the method of activation has on the delivered pulse interval has never been studied. Objectives: This study measured the timing of four methods of DD and the resulting inter-shock intervals, frequency with which they were either DSiD or DSD, and frequency which the true DSDs delivered any previously reported optimum pulse interval. Methods: This was a single-blinded prospective evaluation of a convenience sample of volunteer physicians, nurses, and paramedics each performing DD in our simulation center on two types of defibrillators using four techniques: single operator-simultaneous with 2 hands (SOSI), two operators-simultaneous (TOSI), single operator-sequential with 1 hand (SOSE1), and single operator-sequential with 2 hands (SOSE2). Results: The four DD methods generated a variable set of pulse intervals depending on the technique and defibrillator employed. The pulse intervals ranged from 0 msec (i.e., overlapping waveforms or DSiD) to 1800 msec. Of all DD attempts, 85.9% met the definition of DSD, 14.1% were DSiD, and 49.4% delivered any one of the optimum pulse intervals previously described in the literature. SOSI and TOSI techniques resulted in DSD between 47.2 and 87.6% of the time, depending on the technique and defibrillator. Shocks delivered sequentially on purpose (SOSE2 and SOSE1) were always DSD but with widely variable pulse intervals. SOSI resulted in the shortest pulse intervals, SOSE1 resulted in the longest, and TOSI and SOSE2 were the least skewed. Conclusion: DD using the various methods currently employed produces a highly variable set of pulse intervals even within a single method. It is difficult to reach a conclusion about the efficacy of DD unless the delivered pulse interval is measured or the method of activation reproducibly produces a precise pulse interval.",Management of antithrombin deficiency: an update for clinicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116611,Expert review of hematology,2019 05 29,"Introduction. Antithrombin is a serpin that inhibits multiple procoagulant serine proteases and acts as an endogenous anticoagulant. Thus, congenital antithrombin deficiency constitutes a major thrombophilic state, the most severe so far. Areas covered. In the present work, we globally review the biology, genetics, diagnosis, and management of congenital antithrombin deficiency, and also discuss puzzling questions and future perspectives regarding this severe inherited thrombophilia. Expert opinion. Although this disorder exerts high clinical heterogeneity, many carriers will need careful and long-term anticoagulation and/or thromboprophylaxis, especially in high-risk situations, such as surgery and pregnancy. Notably, antithrombin concentrates constitute a considerable arsenal for both treatment and prevention of acute venous thrombosis in subjects with antithrombin deficiency. Current evidences are based almost exclusively on retrospective case series, so an integrated functional, biochemical and molecular characterization will be of clinical relevance and guide hematologists' personalized decisions.",The value of anti-Mullerian hormone in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116610,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 05 22,"A prospective study was carried out in 110 adolescents (13-19 years), 90 patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (study group) and 20 healthy adolescents (control group). The study group was divided into two: Group I - patients without insulin resistance (n = 30) and Group II - patients with insulin resistance (n = 60). Group I was treated with oral contraceptives (OCs), while Group II was divided into treatment subgroups of 20 patients each: Subgroup A received OCs; Subgroup B - myo-inositol; subgroup C - OCs + myo-inositol. Data were analyzed at baseline, 3 and 6 months of treatment. Results showed average anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were significantly higher in PCOS patients (11.8 ± 5.3 ng/ml) than in controls (2.98 ± 4.5 ng/ml). After treatment, in Group I and Group II Subgroup A: AMH, luteinizing hormone (LH), free testosterone (FT), total testosterone (T), Ov/v, antral follicle count (AFC), and Ferriman-Gallwey modified scale (mFG) significantly decreased, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body mass index (BMI) did not change significantly. In Group II Subgroup B only HOMA-IR and BMI significantly decreased; in Subgroup C all the parameters decreased significantly. The correlation between AMH and hormonal, morphological characteristics of ovaries were established. The results indicate that AMH could possibly be a valuable marker for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents, and for the assessment of treatment efficacy as well.",Comparison of the expected rewards between probabilistic and deterministic analyses in a Markov model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116609,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2019 05 22,"Objectives: In Markov models that evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health-care technologies, it is generally recommended to use probabilistic analysis instead of deterministic analysis. We sought to compare the performance of probabilistic and deterministic analysis in estimating the expected rewards in a Markov model. Methods: We applied Jensen's inequality to compare the expected Markov rewards between probabilistic and deterministic analysis and conducted a simulation study to compare the bias and accuracy between the two approaches. Results: We provided mathematical justification why probabilistic analysis is associated with greater Markov rewards (life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) compared with deterministic analysis. In our simulations, probabilistic analyses tended to generate greater life-years, bias, and mean square error for the estimated rewards compared with deterministic analyses. When the expected values of transition probabilities were the same, weaker evidence derived from smaller sample sizes resulted in larger Markov rewards compared with stronger evidence derived from larger sample sizes. When longer time horizons were applied in cases of weak evidence, there was a substantial increase in bias where the rewards in both probabilistic and deterministic analysis were overestimated. Conclusion: Authors should be aware that probabilistic analysis may lead to increased bias when the evidence is weak.",Reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation contributes to cardiovascular injury during chronic kidney disease progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116605,American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2019 05 22,"Major cardiovascular events are a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Endothelial dysfunction can contribute to the cardiovascular injury observed in CKD. Here, we used a rat model of acute kidney injury to CKD transition to investigate heart alterations in the pathway activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and its impact on the cardiac injury observed during CKD progression. Fifty male Wistar rats were divided into sham surgery (n=25) or rats subjected to bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR-CKD) for 45 min (n=25). The rats were studied on a monthly basis up to five months (n=5). In another set of sham and IR-CKD rats, L-arginine was administered starting on the third month after the renal ischemia. CKD development and cardiac alterations were monitored in all groups. CKD was characterized by a progressive increase in proteinuria and renal dysfunction that was evident after the fifth month of follow-up. Heart hypertrophy was observed starting on the fourth month after IR. There was a significant increase in brain natriuretic peptide levels. In the heart, IR-CKD rats had increased eNOS phosphorylation at threonine 495 and reduced eNOS-Heat shock protein-90a interaction. L-arginine administration prevented the heart alterations observed during CKD and increased eNOS coupling/dimerization and activation. In summary, CKD progression is accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and increased BNP levels. These alterations were associated with limited eNOS activation in the heart, which may result in reduced NO bioavailability and contribute to cardiac injury during CKD.",A new mouse model of CKD transitioned from ischemic AKI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116604,American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2019 05 22,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly increases the risk of development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is closely associated with the severity of AKI. However, the underlying mechanisms for AKI to CKD transition remain unclear. Several animal models with AKI to CKD transition have been generated and widely used in research, however, none of them exhibit the typical changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or plasma creatinine (PCr), the hallmarks of CKD. In the present study, we developed a novel model with typical phenotype of AKI to CKD transition in C57BL/6 mice. In this model, life-threatening ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) was performed in one kidney, while the contralateral kidney was kept intact to maintain animal survival; then following 2 weeks recovery, when the renal function of the injured kidney restored above the survival threshold, the contralateral intact kidney was removed. The animals of this unilateral two-stage IRI model with pedicle clamping of 21 min and 24 min exhibited an incomplete recovery from AKI, and subsequent progression of CKD with characteristics of progressive decline in GFR, increase in PCr, worsening of proteinuria and deleterious histopathological changes including interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. In conclusion, a new model of AKI to CKD transition was generated in C57BL/6 mice.",Intravenous versus subcutaneous trastuzumab: an economic and patient perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116603,British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),2019 05 22,"Since 2005, when the first patients outside of a clinical trial were treated with trastuzumab at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, a nurse-led service has been developed to facilitate and support a safe treatment pathway for patients. There have been significant developments in the number of patients treated, the mode of administration of the drug and patient choice regarding the location of treatment delivery. This article focuses on the change from intravenous to subcutaneous administration, considering patient experience and choice, particularly in light of the advent of biosimilar drugs, which will necessitate a return to the intravenous route. The relative costs of intravenous and subcutaneous administration are illustrated and the results of a patient survey presented, indicating a strong preference for subcutaneous trastuzumab."

The bibliographic databases of Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection were searched using predetermined search criteria. Research studies published up to February 2019 were considered and following appraisal 36 articles were included in the review. Younger age, disease progression at first presentation, personality factors such as optimism, and moderators such as social support, clinical interventions and development of self-management abilities predicted better quality of life and personal resilience. Not recovering from the physical and psychological impacts of a new diagnosis has implications for future mental and physical health. This systematic, integrative review highlighted that building resilience and working with women's strengths should be the focus for contemporary clinical interventions for women in the early period after diagnosis of breast cancer.",Everolimusinduces G1 cell cycle arrest through autophagy-mediated protein degradation of cyclin D1 in breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116586,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 22,"PurposeEverolimusinhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and are known to cause induction of autophagy and G1 cell cycle arrest. However, it remains unknown whether everolimus-induced autophagy plays a critical role in its regulation of cell cycle. We, for the first time, suggested that everolimus could stimulate autophagy-mediated Cyclin D1 degradation in breast cancer cells. MethodsEverolimus-induced Cyclin D1 degradation through autophagy pathway was investigated in MCF-10DCIS.COM and MCF-7 cell lines upon autophagy inhibitor treatment using western blot assay. Everolimus stimulated autophagy and decreased Cyclin D1 were also tested in explant human breast tissue.Results Inhibiting mTORC1 with everolimus rapidly increased Cyclin D1 degradation, while 3-Methyladenine, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, the classic autophagy inhibitors could attenuate everolimus-induced Cyclin D1 degradation. Similarly, knockdown of autophagy related gene 7 (Atg-7) also repressed everolimus-triggered Cyclin D1 degradation. In addition, everolimus-induced autophagy occurred earlier than its induction of G1 arrest and blockade of autophagy attenuated everolimus-induced G1 arrest. We also found that everolimus stimulated autophagy and decreased Cyclin D1 levels in explant human breast tissue. ConclusionsThese data support the conclusion that the autophagy induced by everolimusin human mammary epithelial cells appears to cause Cyclin D1 degradation resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest. Our findings contribute to our knowledge of the interplay between autophagy and cell cycle regulation mediated by mTORC1 signaling and Cyclin D1 regulation.",Disrupted APOL1-miR193a Axis Dedifferentiates Podocytes through Autophagy Blockade in APOL1 Risk Milieu.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116585,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 22,"We hypothesized that a functional APOL1-miR193a axis (inverse relationship) preserves, but disruption alters the podocyte molecular phenotype through the modulation of autophagy flux. Podocytes-expressing APOL1G0 (G0-podocytes) showed down-regulation but podocytes-expressing APOL1G1 (G1-podocytes) and APOL1G2 (G2-podocytes) displayed enhanced miR193a expression. G0-, G1-, and G2-podocytes showed enhanced expression of light chain (LC) 3-II and beclin-1, but a disparate expression of P62 (low in wild-type but high in risk alleles). G0-podocytes showed enhanced, however, G1 and G2 podocytes displayed decreased phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK) 1 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3). Podocytes-overexpressing miR193a (miR193a-podocytes), G1, and G2 showed decreased transcription of PIK3R3 (PI3KC3's regulatory unit). Since 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced miR193a expression but inhibited PIK3R3 transcription, it appears that 3-MA inhibits autophagy and induces podocyte de-differentiation via miR193a generation. miR193a-, G1-, and G2-podocytes also showed decreased phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that could repress lysosome reformation. G1- and G2-podocytes showed an enhanced expression of run domain beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain containing protein (Rubicon), however, its silencing prevented their de-differentiation. Docking, protein-protein interaction, and immunoprecipitation studies with anti-autophagy related gene (ATG) 14L, anti-UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), or Rubicon antibodies suggested the formation of ATG14L complex I and UVRAG complex II in G0- podocytes and the formation of Rubicon complex III in G1- and G2-podocytes. These findings suggest that the APOL1 risk alleles favor podocyte de-differentiation through blockade of multiple autophagy pathways.",Involvement of DHX9/YB-1 complex induced alternative splicing of KLF5 mRNA in phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116584,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 22,"Phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells is a key phenomenon in the development of aortic dissection disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not fully been understood. We used β-BAPN combined with Ang II treatment to establish a disease model of acute aortic dissection (AAD) in mice. We first examined the gene expression profile of aortic tissue in mice with AAD using a gene chip, followed by confirmation of DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) expression using RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. We further developed vascular smooth muscle cell-specific DHX9 conditional knockout mice and conducted differential and functional analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells. Finally, we examined the involvement of DHX9 in KLF5 mRNA alternative splicing. Our study reported the significant decrease in the expression of DHX9 in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of mice with AAD. The smooth muscle cell-specific knockout of DHX9 exacerbated the development of AAD and altered the transcriptional level expression of many smooth muscle cell phenotype-related genes. Finally, we reported that DHX9 may induce alternative splicing of KLF5 mRNA by bridging YB-1. These results together suggested a new pathogenic mechanism underlying the development of AAD, and future research of this mechanism may help identify effective therapeutic intervention for AAD.",Zinc deficiency up-regulates ET-1 mediated secretion and endothelial cell migration through nuclear HIF-1 translocation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116583,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 22,"Zinc is involved in the expression and function of various transcription factors including the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 and its target gene endothelin-1 (ET-1) are activated by intermittent hypoxia (IH), one of the main consequences of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and both play a key role in the cardiovascular consequences of IH. Since OSA and IH are associated with zinc deficiency, we investigated the effect of zinc deficiency caused by chelation on the HIF‑1‑ET-1 pathway and its functional consequences in endothelial cells.",IGF-IIRα is a novel stress-inducible contributor to cardiac damage underpinning doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress and perturbed mitochondrial autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116582,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 22,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is an anthracycline antibiotic commonly employed for the treatment of various cancers. However, its therapeutic uses are hampered by side-effects associated with cumulative doses during the course of treatment. Whereas deregulation of autophagy in the myocardium has been involved in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, the role of autophagy in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy remains debated. Our earlier studies have shown that DOX treatment in rat animal model leads to increased expression of a novel stress-inducible protein IGF-IIRα in cardiac tissues which synergistically exacerbated the cardiac injury by enhancing oxidative stress and p53 mediated mitochondria-dependent cardiac apoptosis. Through this study, we investigated the contribution of IGF-IIRα in dysregulation of autophagy in heart using both in vitro H9c2 cells (DOX-treated, 1 µM ) and in vivo transgenic rat models (DOX-treated, 5 mg/kg I.P. for 6 weeks) overexpressing IGF-IIRα specifically in the heart. We found that IGF-IIRα primarily localized to mitochondria causing increased mitochondrial oxidative stress which was severely aggravated by DOX treatment. This was accompanied by a significant perturbation in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased leakage of cytochrome C causing increased cleaved-caspase 3 activities. There were significant alterations in p-AMPK, p-ULK1, PARKIN, PINK1, LC3 and p62 proteins which were more severely disrupted under the combined effect of IGF-IIRα overexpression plus DOX. Finally, lysotracker red staining showed that IGF-IIRα causes lysosomal impairment which was rescued by rapamycin treatment. Together, we found that IGF-IIRα leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress, decreased anti-oxidants, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and perturbed mitochondrial autophagy contributing to DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.",Cyclic compression increases F508 Del CFTR expression in ciliated human airway epithelium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116581,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 06 10,"Mechanisms by which transepithelial pressure changes observed during exercise and airway clearance can benefit lung health are challenging to study. Here, we have studied 117 mature, fully ciliated airway epithelial cell filters grown at air liquid interface grown from 10 cystic fibrosis (CF) and 19 control subjects. These were exposed to cyclic increases in apical air pressure of 15 cm H2O for varying times. We measured the effect on proteins relevant to lung health, with a focus on the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR). Immunoflourescence and immunoblot data were concordant in demonstrating that air pressure increased F508Del CFTR expression and maturation. This effect was in part dependent on the presence of cilia, on Ca2+ influx and on formation of nitrogen oxides. These data provide a mechanosensory mechanism by which changes in luminal air pressure, like those observed during exercise and airway clearance, can affect epithelial protein expression and benefit patients with diseases of the airways.",Autophagy proteins are required for club cell structure and function in airways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116580,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 22,"Epithelial cells that line lung airways produce and secrete proteins with important roles in barrier function and host defense. Secretion of airway goblet cells is controlled by autophagy proteins during inflammatory conditions, resulting in accumulation of mucin proteins. We hypothesized that autophagy proteins would also be important in the function of club cells, a dominant secretory airway epithelial cell that is dysregulated in chronic lung disease. We found that in the absence of an inflammatory stimulus, mice with club cells deficient for the autophagy protein Atg5, had a markedly diminished expression of secreted host defense proteins Scgb1a1, Sftpa1 and Sftpd, as well as abnormal club cell morphology. Adult mice with targeted loss of Atg5 also showed diminished levels of host defense proteins in regenerating cells following ablation with naphthalene. A mouse strain with global deficiency of Atg16l1, an Atg5 binding partner, had a similar loss of host defense proteins and abnormal club cell morphology. Cigarette smoke exposure reduced levels of Scgb1a1 in WT mice as expected. Smoke exposure was not required to trigger club cell abnormalities in mice bearing the human ATG16 variant Atg16l1T300A/T300Awhich had low Scgb1a1 levels independent of this environmental stress. Evaluation of lung tissues from subjects who were former smokers with severe COPD showed evidence of reduced autophagy and SCGB1A1 expression in club cells. Thus, autophagy proteins are required for the function of club cells, independent of the cellular stress of cigarette smoke, with roles that appear to be distinct from other secretory cell types.","Organic dust, causing both oxidative stress and Nrf2 activation, is phagocytized by bronchial epithelial cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116579,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 22,"Inhalation of organic dust (OD) from swine confinement facilities leads to pulmonary inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and oxidative stress. In mice, pre-treatment with a hydroxyl radical scavenger prevents airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) induced by OD exposure. We sought to determine a mechanism by which OD could induce oxidative stress in bronchial epithelial cells.",The Huxley crossbridge model as the basic mechanism for airway smooth muscle contraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116578,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 22,"The cyclic interaction between myosin crossbridges and actin filaments underlies smooth muscle contraction. Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) is a crucial step in activating the crossbridge cycle. Our current understanding of smooth muscle contraction is based on observed correlations among MLC20 phosphorylation, maximal shortening velocity (Vmax), and isometric force over the time course of contraction. However during contraction there are changes in the extent of phosphorylation of many additional proteins as well as changes in activation of enzymes associated with the signaling pathways. As a consequence, the mechanical manifestation of muscle contraction is likely to change with time. To simplify the study of these relationships, we measured the mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle at different levels of MLC20 phosphorylation at a fixed time during contraction. A simple correlation emerged when time-dependent variables were fixed. MLC20 phosphorylation was found to be directly and linearly correlated with the active stress, stiffness, and power of the muscle; the observed weak dependence of Vmax on MLC20 phosphorylation could be explained by the presence of an internal load in the muscle preparation. These results can be entirely explained by the Huxley crossbridge model. We conclude that, when the influence of time-dependent events during contraction is held constant, the basic crossbridge mechanism in smooth muscle is the same as that in striated muscle."

A total of 650 individuals (S. griseus, 444 individuals; S. tigrinus, 206 individuals) were obtained from 64 sites. The haplotype networks of both species showed three major lineages with roughly regional distribution. However, the two species show quite different genetic structures; S. griseus has a complicated structure while that of S. tigrinus is simple. We hypothesize that the genetic structure of each of these two weevil species reflects climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene, and the differences in genetic structure between S. griseus and S. tigrinus may represent a unique evolutionary history scenario in each species.",Hindgut Bacterial Flora Analysis in Oriental Honey Buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116541,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"The intestinal microbiome is known to affect host health through various effects on nutrition and immunity. The oriental honey buzzard (OHB) is a raptor that feeds on bees and wasps. Due to its restricted diet, we reasoned that the OHB may have a unique microbiome. The aim of this study was to characterize the structure of the intestinal flora of oriental honey buzzards and to investigate the difference of intestinal bacterial flora between individuals in the wild and those reared in captivity. We investigated the intestinal microbiome of seven wild buzzards (Wild), one zoo-reared (Zoo), and one individual reared in captivity for one month (Rearing). Average operational taxonomic units in Wild and Rearing were 69.4 and 113, respectively. Diversity indices such as ACE, Chao 1, Shannon, and Alpha were significantly lower in the Wild than in the Rearing samples. These results suggest that the variety of Wild microbiome is remarkably low. At the phylum level, the composition of the microbiome was similar in all three groups, with firmicutes and bacteroidetes predominating. The third most abundant bacterium in Wild was Proteobacteria, whereas it was Actinobacteria in Rearing and unclassified bacteria in Zoo. Thus, microbiome composition is affected even with just one month of human rearing.","Characterization of a Cathelicidin from the Colubrinae Snake, Sinonatrix annularis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116540,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"The cathelicidins represent an important family of host defense peptides (HDPs) found exclusively in vertebrates, which serve as a critical effector in host immune response against microbial infections. To date, a large number of cathelicidins has been identified from diverse vertebrates, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes. Sixteen cathelicidins have been identified from snakes in the Elapidae, Viperidae, and Biodae families. However, no cathelicidin has been discovered from a snake of the Colubrinae family. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel cathelicidin, SA-CATH, from the Colubrinae family snake, Sinonatrix annularis. The cDNA sequence encoding SA-CATH precursor is 735 bp in length, and the mature peptide (SA-CATH) is composed of 30 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment result indicated that SA-CATH precursor possesses relatively high sequence similarity with the cathelicidins from Elapidae and Viperidae family snakes. Similar as the cathelicidins from Elapidae, Viperidae, and Biodae family snakes, SA-CATH mainly assumes an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation, and possesses potent antimicrobial, biofilm inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities. The results in the present study imply that cathelicidins serve as a kind of conserved effectors with similar structures in the immune systems of Colubrinae, Boidae, Elapidae and Viperidae family snakes. The identification of SA-CATH provides novel clues for the understanding of function and evolution of snake immune systems. The potent antimicrobial, biofilm inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, and slight cytotoxic activities of SA-CATH imply that it is a potential drug candidate in novel antimicrobial agent development.","Antagonistic Effect of Short Neuropeptide F on Allatotropin-Inhibited Feeding Motivation of the Silkworm Larva, Bombyx mori.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116539,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"Here, we demonstrated an antagonistic effect of short neuropeptide F (sNPF) in modulating feeding motivation in the silkworm Bombyx mori; sNPF reduced the feeding-delaying effects caused by administration of an inhibitory peptide, allatotropin (AT). In situ hybridization and MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed the presence of three subtypes of sNPFs (sNPF-1, -2, and -3) in the midgut enteroendocrine cells. Ca2+-imaging analyses revealed that three subtypes of sNPF receptors (sNPFRs) (BNGR-A7, -A10, and -A11) showed different affinities with the three subtypes of sNPFs. In addition, sNPF activated its signaling via ERK phosphorylation in the midgut, while mixture of sNPF and AT reduced the phosphorylation level, agreeing with the results of behavioral assay. Together, our current findings suggest that intestinal sNPF positively modulates the feeding motivation by reducing the inhibitory effects by AT within the midgut.",Effects of Temperature on Life History Strategy of the Rotifer Euchlanis dilatata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116538,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"The cosmopolitan littoral rotifer Euchlanis dilatata is a potential model species in eco-toxicological and ecological studies, owing to its unique characteristics, such as periphytic benthic living, sensitivity to toxicity, and laying eggs on substrates instead of carrying them on the mother's body. However, studies about the life history strategy of this species, in contrast to the intensely studied planktonic Brachionus species, are relatively scarce. Temperature is an important factor that affects the rotifer's life history traits, and is well known to induce phenotypic plasticity in planktonic rotifers. The present study measured life table parameters of the rotifer E. dilatata originating from one clonal population local to Beijing under three temperature treatments: 14°C, 20°C and 26°C (10 females/replicate × 4 replicates for each treatment). We also examined trade-offs between egg size and egg number, as well as current reproduction and future survival to evaluate the life history strategy of the rotifer. In contrast to cold conditions, in which mothers produced a few large eggs with similar egg sizes, in warm environments, mothers produced many smaller eggs and a few larger eggs, thus resulting in a clear variation in egg sizes. With increasing temperature, the pre-mature period, reproductive period, life span and generation time shortened, while the net reproductive rate and population growth rate increased. Temperature also affected the trade-off between current reproduction and future survival. This work provides basic data for the potential model species E. dilatata.","Different Life Histories and Life Styles in Spatangoid Echinoids Living in the Shallow Sublittoral Zone in the Oki-Islands, Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116537,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"The growth rate, reproduction, recruitment and feeding of four spatangoid species in the Okiislands in the Japan Sea were investigated over five years. Nacospatangus alta, which inhabits unstable surface sediments, grows rapidly, reaches sexual maturity early, and has a short life span, indicating that it should be a ruderal, whereas Metalia spatagus and Brissus agassizii, which inhabit relatively stable deep sediment, grow slowly, reach sexual maturity late, and have a long life span, suggesting that they are stress-tolerators. Lovenia elongata, however, inhabits unstable surface sediment but has an exceptional life history; it grows rapidly, but does not reach sexual maturity early and has a long life span, likely because the specific morphology of its spines and tubercles allow it to cope with surface disturbances caused by storms. Lovenia elongata seems to be a competitive ruderal. A trade-off between test formation and gonad development may occur; N. alta constructs a fragile test with very thin plates, allowing the echinoid to allocate energy to increasing test size and developing the gonad to sexual maturity within a year. Lovenia elongata, with thick plates supporting the specific stout spines and tubercles, needs 2 years to reach sexual maturity with a similar rate of test growth to that of N. alta; M. spatagus and B. agassizii construct robust tests with thick plates, presumably necessary for these species, which burrow and live deep in sand under high pressure from surrounding sand. These echinoids do not reach sexual maturity until over 2 years of age. The flexible trade-off related to stress and disturbance associated with burrowing depth in different habitats allows the spatangoids to have different life-history strategies.",Changing Leaf Geometry Provides a Refuge from a Parasitoid for a Leaf Miner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116536,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"The use of physical barriers is a common defensive strategy in small-sized endophagous arthropods, but this feeding mode often results in tracks being left on host organisms, thus increasing predation risk. Mechanisms of escape from tracking predators are thus particularly important for endophagous arthropods. Leaf miners are herbivorous insects that inhabit the interiors of leaves and produce various forms of tracks on their host plants. Such tracks are called ""mines,"" and parasitoid wasps, which are the primary enemy of leaf miners, use mines as cues to find host larvae. In the present study, we use the leaf-mining moth Acrocercops transecta (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), which changes mine forms during larval growth, and its primary parasitoid Aneurobracon philippinensis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Larvae of A. transecta make narrow linear mines in the first and second instars, the third instars expand the mines to flat blotch mines, and the fourth and fifth instars construct three-dimensional tentiform blotch mines. A laboratory parasitization experiment showed that successful oviposition rates were significantly lower on tentiform blotch mines than on other mine types. In contrast, all fifth instars that were transplanted into flat blotch mines were oviposited, suggesting that older instars did not deter ovipositing parasitoids and that the lower rates of successful oviposition on tentiform blotch mines were attributable to refuges inside such mines provided by their three-dimensional structure. Field data demonstrated a plateau in parasitism rates in fourth instar larvae, confirming the results of the laboratory experiment. These results indicate that different mine forms affect the viability of endophagous larvae.",Multiple Conserved Elements Structuring Inverted Repeats in the Mammalian Coat Color-Related Gene Asip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116535,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"In the agouti signaling gene protein (Asip) of the house mouse (Mus musculus), inverted repeat (IR) arrays are known to exist in a non-coding region adjacent to the ventral-specific promoter region and the accompanying two exons (exons 1A and 1A'), which are around 100 kb upstream from the amino acid coding regions of exons 2, 3, and 4. To determine the gene structure of mammalian Asip and to elucidate trends in its evolution, non-coding sequences of six rodent (mouse, rat, Chinese hamster, squirrel, guinea pig, and naked mole rat) and three non-rodent (rabbit, human, and cow) species were retrieved from databases and compared. Our homology search analyses revealed the presence of three to five highly conserved non-coding elements (CNE). These CNEs were found to form IRs in rodents and lagomorphs. Combinations of IRs were further shown to build symmetric, long IR arrays. Intra- and inter-specific comparisons of the sequences of three universal CNEs showed homogeneity between CNE pairs within species. This implies that certain evolutionary constraints maintained the IR structure in the rodent and rabbit species.","Analysis of the Genetic Diversity and Structure of the Grey-Faced Buzzard (Butastur indicus) in Japan, Based on mtDNA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116534,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"The grey-faced buzzard (Butastur indicus) is a raptor that inhabits East Asia, including Japan. Because the number of individuals has decreased by 75% over the last 40 years, this species is classified as vulnerable (VU) in Japan. In the present study, wesought to reveal the genetic structure of the Japanese grey-faced buzzard population at several breeding sites, and to assess the levels of genetic diversity within the Japanese population. We sequenced 555 bp of the mitochondrial DNA of 96 individuals sampled during the breeding season at 18 sites, and 11 individuals sampled during the winter season at one site. In total, 21 variable sites were found in the control region, and we detected 26 haplotypes among the 107 individuals. Fukuoka represented the core breeding area for grey-faced buzzards, as half of all haplotypes were detected there. Four unique haplotypes were detected in the overwintering area. The results of the network and mismatch distribution analyses indicated that the grey-faced buzzard has not experienced a genetic bottleneck in the past, but did experience recent population expansion. In addition, comparisons with other raptors revealed rich genetic diversity in the grey-faced buzzard population. Our results indicate that conservation of both breeding and wintering areas is important for the protection of the grey-faced buzzard.",Live Imaging of Cleavage Variability and Vesicle Flow Dynamics in Dextral and Sinistral Spiralian Embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116533,Zoological science,2019 06 05,"Spiral cleavage is a mode of embryonic cell division found in species from several Phyla, including molluscs, annelids and flatworms. It reflects a tilting in the direction of spindle orientation and cell division at the 4 to 8-cell stage, which may be dextral or sinistral, and propagates into later organismal asymmetry. Genetic analysis in a small number of gastropod molluscs shows the direction of spiral cleavage is determined by maternal genotype, though whether this is also the case more generally for spiralians, and whether spiral cleavage at the 4-8 cell stage is preceded by earlier internal chirality in any spiralian species, is unknown. Here we study the early cleavage stages of two equal-cleaving spiralians, the dextral annelid Spirobranchus lamarcki and the sinistral mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata, using light sheet microscopy to image subcellular vesicles in live embryos and asking if chirality of movement is identifiable. We observe variability in the early cleavage of S. lamarcki, including a viable 3-cell stage. Image data are analysed by both particle tracking and particle image velocimetry. Neither finds evidence for chiral movement in 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-cell embryos, nor do we detect consistent differences between the embryos of the dextral and sinistrai species. The methodological and evolutionary implications of this are discussed."

The ER undergoes dynamic alterations in morphology, molecular composition and functional specification. Remodelling of the network under fluctuating conditions enables the continual performance of ER functions and minimizes stress. Recent data have revealed that selective autophagy-mediated degradation of ER fragments, or ER-phagy, fundamentally contributes to this remodelling. This review provides a perspective on established views of selective autophagy, comparing these with emerging mechanisms of ER-phagy and related processes. The text discusses the impact of ER-phagy on the function of the ER- and the cell, both in normal physiology and when dysregulated within disease settings. Finally, unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms and significance of ER-phagy are highlighted.",Targeting of DDR1 with antibody-drug conjugates has antitumor effects in a mouse model of colon carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116512,Molecular oncology,2019 05 22,"DDR1 has been identified as a cancer-associated receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in several malignancies relative to normal tissues. Clinically approved multi-kinase inhibitors, such as nilotinib, inhibit DDR1-mediated tumor growth in xenograft models, suggesting DDR1 might be a potential target for cancer treatments. Here, we employed an antibody-based strategy with a novel anti-DDR1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for colon carcinoma treatment. We developed T4 H11 -DM4, an ADC targeting DDR1 which carries the tubulin inhibitor payload DM4. Immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray containing 100 colon cancer specimens revealed that DDR1 was highly expressed in 81% of tumor tissues. Meanwhile, DDR1 high expression was associated with poor survival in patients. In vitro, T4 H11 -DM4 exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity with IC50 values in the nanomolar range in a panel of colon cancer cell lines. In vivo, the antitumor efficacy of T4 H11 -DM4 was evaluated in three colon cancer cell lines expressing different levels of DDR1. T4 H11 -DM4 achieved complete tumor regression at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg in HT-29 and HCT116 tumor models. Moreover, a correlation between in vivo efficacy of T4 H11 -DM4 and the levels of DDR1 expression on the cell surface was observed. Tumor cell proliferation was caused by the induction of mitotic arrest, indicating that the antitumor effect in vivo was mediated by DM4. In addition, T4 H11 -DM4 was efficacious in oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer models. In exploratory safety studies, T4 H11 -DM4 exhibited no overt toxicities when multi-doses were administered at 10 mg/kg into BALB/c nude mice, or when a single dose up to 50 mg/kg was administered into BALB/c mice. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of DDR1-targeted ADC and may facilitate the development of a new effective therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.",Structural Investigations on the Interactions between Cytidine Deaminase Human APOBEC3G and DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116511,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 06 14,"Human APOBEC3G (A3G) inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 by deaminating cytidine at the 3'-end in the target motif 5'-CCC-3' in viral cDNA during reverse transcription. It in vitro deaminates two consecutive cytidines in a 3'->5' order. Although a crystal structure of the A3G catalytic domain (A3G-CD2) with DNA was reported, it is unknown why residues involved in enzymatic reaction are distributed widely. Here, we introduced an iodine atom into the C-5 position of cytidine (dC6I ) in DNA 5'-ATTC4 C5 C6I A7 ATT-3' (TCCC6I ). It switches the deamination sequence preference from CCC to TCC, although small dC6I deamination was observed. Solution structures of A3G-CD2 in complexes with products DNA TCUC6I and TCUU6I indicate that the substrate DNA binds A3G-CD2 in TCC and CCC modes. The dC6 deamination correlates with the 4th base type. The CCC mode favours dC6 deamination, while the TCC mode results in dC5 deamination. These studies present an extensive basis to design inhibitors to impede viral evolvability.","Detection of circulating tumor cells in colorectal cancer patients using the Gilupi CellCollector: Results from a prospective, single center study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116510,Molecular oncology,2019 05 22,"The Gilupi CellCollector is a novel in vivo circulating tumor cell (CTC)-detection device reported to overcome the limitations of small blood sample volumes. The aim of this prospective, blinded study was to evaluate the clinical application of the CellCollector and to compare its performance to the CellSearch system in M0 and M1 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A total of 80 patients (31 M0, 49 M1) with CRC were enrolled. CTCs were simultaneously measured in the peripheral blood using CellSearch and the CellCollector, and the results of both assays were correlated to clinicopathological variables and overall survival. The total number of detected CTCs and CTC positive patients did not significantly differ between both assays. In the M0 patients, the CellCollector detected CTCs more frequently than CellSearch. There was no significant difference in total CTC numbers detected with the CellCollector between M0 and M1 patients. In addition, no significant correlation with clinicopathological parameters or overall survival was observed with CellCollector CTCs. In contrast, detection of CTCs with CellSearch was significantly correlated with UICC stage and reduced overall survival. There was no correlation between CTCs detected by the CellCollector and the CellSearch system. Using in-silico analysis, we estimate that CellCollector screens a volume of 0.33 - 18 mL during in vivo application, in contrast to much higher volumes reported elsewhere. In conclusion, while being safe and easy to use, the CellCollector did not outperform CellSearch in terms of CTC yield or sensitivity. While CTC detection in M0 CRC patients was significantly increased with the CellCollector, the clinical relevance of these CTCs appears inferior to the cells identified by the CellSearch system.",Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 promotes the stemness of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by enhancing YAP transcriptional activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116509,FEBS open bio,2019 06 11,"The tumor promoting roles of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1 have been revealed in various cancers; however, its roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have not previously been disclosed. In this study, we found that MALAT1 expression was remarkably increased in ESCC cells compared to normal human esophageal epithelial cells. In addition, knockdown of MALAT1 attenuated the stemness of ESCC cells, as evidenced by a decrease in spheroid formation capacity, stemness marker expression and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity. Moreover, MALAT1 knockdown decreased the migration ability of ESCC cells. Notably, knockdown of MALAT1 enhanced the radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity of ESCC cells. We also established that MALAT1 binds directly to Yes-associated protein (YAP), thereby enhancing YAP protein expression and increasing YAP transcriptional activity. Overexpression of YAP partially rescued the effect of MALAT1 knockdown on stemness and radiosensitivity of ESCC cells. Overall, this study has identified that a novel MALAT1-YAP axis promotes the stemness of ESCC cells, and thus could be a potential target for treatment of ESCC.",Development of bone regeneration strategies using human periosteum-derived osteoblasts and oxygen-releasing microparticles in mandibular osteomyelitis model of miniature pig.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116505,Journal of biomedical materials research. Part A,2019 06 06,"Hypoxia and limited vascularization inhibit bone growth and recovery after surgical debridement to treat osteomyelitis. Similarly, despite significant efforts to create functional tissue-engineered organs, clinical success is often hindered by insufficient oxygen diffusion and poor vascularization. To overcome these shortcomings, we previously used the oxygen carrier perfluorooctane (PFO) to develop PFO emulsion-loaded hollow microparticles (PFO-HPs). PFO-HPs act as a local oxygen source that increase cell viability and maintains the osteogenic differentiation potency of human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs) under hypoxic conditions. In the present study, we used a miniature pig model of mandibular osteomyelitis to investigate bone regeneration using hPDCs seeded on PFO-HPs (hPDCs/PFO-HP) or hPDCs seeded on phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-HPs (hPDCs/PBS-HP). Osteomyelitis is characterized by a series of microbial invasion, vascular disruption, bony necrosis, and sequestrum formation due to impaired host defense response. Sequential plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), and 3D reconstructed CT images revealed new bone formation was more advanced in defects that had been implanted with the hPDCs/PFO-HPs than in defects implanted with the hPDCs/PBS-HP. Thus, PFO-HPs are a promising tissue engineering approach to repair challenging bone defects and regenerate structurally organized bone tissue with 3D architecture.",Pulp sensibility to electric stimuli in the Caucasian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116503,Australian endodontic journal : the journal of the Australian Society of Endodontology Inc,2019 05 22,"The aim of the study was to determine electric sensibility of the pulp in the Caucasian population depending on tooth morphotype, age and sex. Dental pulp sensibility was determined in 279 patients (2640 teeth). The study group consisted of 226 patients (1296 teeth), 110 men and 116 women aged 55-101. The control group consisted of 53 patients (1344 teeth), 23 men and 30 women aged 20-30. A statistically significant lower sensory threshold and increased pulp sensibility in the study group were noted. These affected the lower incisors, the second upper premolars and the first and second upper molar. The differences in the pulp sensibility were found in the region of maxillary central incisors, maxillary premolars, mandibular lateral incisors and mandibular premolars. The pulp sensibility threshold was lower for the aforementioned groups of teeth in the study group. The correlation between sensibility of the pulp and sex was not confirmed.",Do differences in reported expenditures between household scanner data and expenditure surveys matter in health policy research?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116502,Health economics,2019 05 22,"Household scanner data are increasingly used to inform health policy such as sugar-sweetened beverage taxes. This article examines whether differences in the level of reported expenditures between IRI Consumer Network scanner panel and the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) lead to important differences in demand elasticities and policy simulation outcomes. Using each dataset, we estimated a structural consumer demand system with seven food groups and a numéraire good. To compare the two datasets on a level playing field, we went to great lengths to ensure that the explanatory variables in the two demand models were comparably constructed. Results indicate that scanner data households are not consistently more price responsive than the general population and underreported Consumer Network expenditures do not seem to result in systematic differences in price elasticities. The income elasticities are uniformly lower in Consumer Network than in CES for higher income households because of the positive association between income and the degree of underreporting. This, however, has limited effects on uncompensated price elasticities and policy simulations because food budget shares are small for higher income households. Overall, these findings support continued use of household scanner data in health policy research related to effects of price (dis)incentives.",Economic downturns and nurse attachment to federal employment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116501,Health economics,2019 05 22,"The impact of the financial crisis has been uneven-with differences across industries and occupations.

What is not known is how important public sector employment opportunities are for these national nursing trends. Observing the universe of nurses working for one of the largest (and publicly operated) health care employers, we show that worsening economic conditions lead to stronger job attachment. Relatedly, older nurses also seem more willing to delay retirement and instead transition to part-time positions during a downturn.",Women's health literacy and the complex decision-making process to use complementary medicine products in pregnancy and lactation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116500,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,2019 05 22,Little is known about women's decision-making processes regarding using complementary medicine products (CMPs) during pregnancy or lactation.

Clinical evaluation has been limited by a lack of surrogate endpoints capable of quantitating disease activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of 18 F-NaF PET/CT imaging in quantifying disease activity in patients with FD. Fifteen consecutively evaluated subjects underwent whole-body 18 F-NaF PET/CT scans, and FD burden was assessed by quantifying FD-related 18 F-NaF activity. 18 F-NaF PET/CT parameters obtained included (i) SUVmax (standardized uptake value [SUV] of the FD lesion with the highest uptake); (ii) SUVmean (average SUV of all 18 F-NaF-positive FD lesions); (iii) total volume of all 18 F-NaF-positive FD lesions (TV); and (iv) total FD lesion activity determined as the product of TV multiplied by SUVmean (TA =  TV ×  SUVmean ) (TA). Skeletal outcomes, functional outcomes, and bone turnover markers were correlated with 18 F-NaF PET/CT parameters. TV and TA of extracranial FD lesions correlated strongly with skeletal outcomes including fractures and surgeries (p values ≤ 0.003). Subjects with impaired ambulation and scoliosis had significantly higher TV and TA values (P < 0.05), obtained from extracranial and spinal lesions, respectively. Craniofacial surgeries correlated with TV and TA of skull FD lesions (P < 0.001). Bone turnover markers, including alkaline phosphatase, N-telopeptides, and osteocalcin, were strongly correlated with TV and TA (P < 0.05) extracted from FD lesions in the entire skeleton. No associations were identified with SUVmax or SUVmean . Bone pain and age did not correlate with 18 F-NaF PET/CT parameters. FD burden evaluated by 18 F-NaF-PET/CT facilitates accurate assessment of FD activity, and correlates quantitatively with clinically-relevant skeletal outcomes.",Treatment of functional mitral regurgitation in chronic heart failure: can we get a 'proof of concept' from the MITRA-FR and COAPT trials?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116485,European journal of heart failure,2019 05 22,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is associated with poor outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it is not clear whether FMR is just a consequence of left ventricular (LV) remodelling or a factor contributing to cardiomyopathy progression. There will be more clarity about this controversy when the effects of FMR correction on outcomes will be shown. FMR correction can be performed surgically or, more often, percutaneously with the MitraClip procedure. MitraClip is the most widely used device with more than 70 000 implants performed to date. Observational studies suggest that MitraClip treatment of FMR is safe and associated with improved symptoms, quality of life and functional status in HF patients. Two recently randomized controlled clinical trials have investigated the impact of MitraClip on the outcomes of HF patients: Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MITRA-FR) and Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT). Both trials randomized patients to MitraClip plus guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) or GDMT alone. No reduction in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations was shown in MITRA-FR, whereas a significant reduction in HF hospitalizations (primary endpoint) as well as in mortality alone were shown in COAPT. The aim of this review is to summarize the pathophysiology, prevalence, prognostic role and management of FMR, focusing on the differences between MITRA-FR and COAPT and trying to provide possible explanations for the diverging results. We speculate that the two trials should be interpreted as complementary rather than opposite. Patients with severe FMR (effective regurgitant orifice area > 30 mm2 ) despite maximum tolerated GDMT (including cardiac resynchronization therapy), and without too advanced cardiomyopathy seem to be the best candidates for MitraClip treatment. MITRA-FR and COAPT provide us a long awaited 'proof of concept': FMR may be considered a leading actor in cardiomyopathy progression rather than a mere marker of severity.",Highly Efficient CO₂ Utilization via Novel Aqueous Zn or Al-CO₂ Systems for H₂ and Electricity Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116484,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 22,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased from 278 to 408 parts per million (ppm) over the industrial period and has critically impacted on climate changes. In response to this crisis, carbon capture, utilization, and storage/sequestration technologies have been recently studied. So far, however, the economic feasibility of the existing conversion technologies is still inadequate due to sluggish CO2 conversion. Herein, we report an aqueous zinc- and aluminum-CO2 system that utilizes an acidity from spontaneous dissolution of CO2 in aqueous solution to generate electrical energy and hydrogen (H2). The proposed system presents the positively shifted onset potential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by 0.4 V compared to a typical HER at alkaline condition and facile HER kinetics with low Tafel slope of 34 mV dec.-1. Particularly, the Al-CO2 system exhibits a maximum power density of 125 mW cm-2 which is the highest value among CO2 utilization electrochemical system.

In this work, a novel structure of TiO2-x with conductive TiO layer, performing full-spectrum absorption, was one-step synthesized by the unforeseen dismutation reaction of Titanium sub-oxides (TinO2n-1) in ammonium halide atmosphere. For this new reaction, a possible mechanism of decomposition - etching - disproportionation - rehydrolysis process was proposed. The vital intermediate reactant TiCl4 verifying the assumption has been captured in the form of (NH4)2TiCl6, especially where Ti2O3 as the reactant. Furthermore, this work not only can ""nominate"" TiO as a candidate for noble metals or carbon materials alternatives in the aim to improve the electron conductivity and solar absorption of black TiO2-x, which are important in electrochemistry and optoelectronics fields, but also can be an implication to synthesize special structure for other multivalent transition metals.",The Persistent Radical Effect in Organic Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116479,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 22,"Radical-radical couplings are mostly nearly diffusion controlled processes. Therefore, the selective cross-coupling of two different radicals is challenging and not a synthetically valuable process. However, if the radicals have a different lifetime and if they are generated at equal rates, cross-coupling will become the dominant process. This high cross-selectivity is based on a kinetic phenomenon called the persistent radical effect (PRE). In this review, an explanation of the PRE supported by simulations of simple model systems is provided. Radical stabilities are discussed within the context of their lifetimes and various examples of PRE-mediated radical-radical couplings in synthesis are discussed. It is shown that the PRE is not restricted to the coupling of a persistent with a transient radical. If one coupling partner is longer-lived than the other transient radical, the PRE operates and high cross-selectivity is achieved. This important point expands the scope of PRE-mediated radical chemistry. The review is divided in two parts. The 1st part is dealing with the coupling of persistent or longer-lived organic radicals. In the 2nd part, ""radical-metal crossover reactions"", metal centered radical species and more generally longer-lived transition metal complexes able to react with radicals are discussed - a field that has flourished recently. The combination of radical σ-bond formation with transition-metal-mediated σ-bond construction significantly enlarges the radical chemistry space. Advantages of both areas are synergistically combined and C-C bond formations not accessible via traditional radical approaches become feasible. Moreover, the metal-mediated coupling step also allows for enantioselective bond formation. Although great progress has been achieved over the years in enantioselective radical chemistry, the radical-metal crossover approach offers advantages, in particular considering the non-existing background coupling leading to racemic compounds.",Developing a MLC modifier program to improve fiducial detection for MV/kV imaging during hypofractionated prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116478,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 06 12,"To develop an Eclipse plug-in (MLC_MODIFIER) that automatically modifies control points to expose fiducials obscured by MLC during VMAT, thereby facilitating tracking using periodic MV/kV imaging.",MetaDome: Pathogenicity analysis of genetic variants through aggregation of homologous human protein domains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116477,Human mutation,2019 05 22,"The growing availability of human genetic variation has given rise to novel methods of measuring genetic tolerance that better interpret variants of unknown significance. We recently developed a concept based on protein domain homology in the human genome to improve variant interpretation. For this purpose we mapped population variation from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and pathogenic mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) onto Pfam protein domains. The aggregation of these variation data across homologous domains into meta-domains allowed us to generate amino-acid resolution of genetic intolerance profiles for human protein domains. Here we developed MetaDome, a fast and easy-to-use web server that visualizes meta-domain information and gene-wide profiles of genetic tolerance. We updated the underlying data of MetaDome to contain information from 56,319 human transcripts, 71,419 protein domains, 12,164,292 genetic variants from gnomAD, and 34,076 pathogenic mutations from ClinVar. MetaDome allows researchers to easily investigate their variants of interest for the presence or absence of variation at corresponding positions within homologous domains. We illustrate the added value of MetaDome by an example that highlights how it may help in the interpretation of variants of unknown significance.

However, whether such IAV infection-experienced (IAV-experienced) mTregs differentiate into a phenotypically and functionally distinct Treg subset and what function they play at the infection site remains poorly defined. In this study, we characterized the phenotype, examined the responsiveness and assessed the suppressive function of IAV-experienced memory Tregs (mTregs). In comparison with inexperienced naïve Tregs (nTregs), mTregs exhibited elevated expression of CD39, CD69, CD103, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 and programmed cell death-1 and could be activated in an antigen-specific manner in vitro and in vivo. When mTregs and nTregs were adoptively cotransferred into recipient mice, mTregs had a competitive advantage in migrating to the IAV-infected lungs. mTregs were more capable of controlling in vitro proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and suppressed CD40 and CD86 upregulation on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Adoptively transferred mTregs, but not adoptively transferred nTregs, significantly attenuated body weight loss, lung pathology and immune cell infiltration into the infected lungs after IAV infection. These results suggest that mTregs generated after IAV infection differentiate into a phenotypically distinct and functionally enhanced Treg subset that can be activated in an antigen-specific manner to exert immunosuppression. We propose vaccination to induce such mTregs as a potential novel strategy to protect against severe IAV infection.",A nationwide survey of fetal myelomeningocele in Japan: Backgrounds for fetal surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116463,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2019 05 22,"Fetal surgery for myelomeningocele (MMC) has yet not been performed in Japan, and the clinical backgrounds of fetal MMC in Japan remain poorly described.

In this study, microdissection of four fresh tissue premature infant cadavers shows that the lingual frenulum is a dynamic, layered structure formed by oral mucosa and the underlying floor of mouth fascia, which is mobilized into a midline fold with tongue elevation and/or retraction. Genioglossus is suspended from the floor of mouth fascia, and in some individuals can be drawn up into the fold of the frenulum. Branches of the lingual nerve are located superficially on the ventral surface of the tongue, immediately beneath the fascia, making them vulnerable to injury during frenotomy procedures. This research challenges the longstanding belief that the lingual frenulum is a midline structure formed by a submucosal ""band"" or ""string"" and confirms that the neonatal lingual frenulum structure replicates that recently described in the adult. This article provides an anatomical construct for understanding and describing variability in lingual frenulum morphology and lays the foundation for future research to assess the impact of specific anatomic variants of lingual frenulum morphology on tongue mobility.

Can imipramine, an antidepressant agent that is a cationic amphiphilic drug that interferes with the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 ) interactions with proteins maintaining the tubular system, be validated as a new detubulating tool? What is the main finding and its importance? Imipramine was validated as a more efficient and less toxic detubulating agent of cardiomyocytes than formamide.

This is achieved through the use of supramolecular templated silica materials prepared with guanosine monophosphate (NGM-1) and folic acid (NFM-1) which enable direct chiral transcription onto the surface of the mesopores after solvent extraction and post calcination of the template. The chiral selectivity and kinetics of the mesoporous materials are measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy on adsorbed molecules with different affinity for the pore surface. NGM-1 and NFM-1 have opposite enantiomeric selectivity for enantiomeric pairs. These results significantly increase the potential of mesoporous materials for chiral separation and enantiomeric catalysis.,Suboccipital Myodural Bridges Revisited: Application to Cervicogenic Headaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116454,"Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 11,"There seems to be no complete demonstration of the suboccipital fascial configuration. In 30 human fetuses near term, we found two types of candidate myodural bridge: (1) a thick connective tissue band running between the rectus capitis posterior major and minor muscles (rectus capitis posterior major [Rma], rectus capitis posterior minori [Rmi]; Type 1 bridge; 27 fetuses); and (2) a thin fascia extending from the upper margin of the Rmi (Type 2 bridge; 20 fetuses). Neither of these bridge candidates contained elastic fibers. The Type 1 bridge originated from: (1) fatty tissue located beneath the semispinalis capitis (four fetuses); (2) a fascia covering the multifidus (nine); (3) a fascia bordering between the Rma and Rmi or lining the Rma (13); (4) a fascia covering the inferior aspect of the Rmi (three); and (5) a common fascia covering the Rma and obliquus capitis inferior muscle (nine). Multiple origins usually coexisted in the 27 fetuses. In the minor Type 2 bridge, composite fibers were aligned in the same direction as striated muscle fibers. Thus, force transmission via the thin fascia seemed to be effective along a straight line. However, in the major Type 1 bridges, striated muscle fibers almost always did not insert into or originate from the covering fascia. Moreover, at and near the dural attachment, most composite fibers of Type 1 bridges were interrupted by subdural veins and dispersed around the veins. In newborns, force transmission via myodural bridges was likely to be limited or ineffective. The postnatal growth might determine a likely connection between the bridge and headache. Clin.

Injection of GQDs prior the standards/sample is crucial to increase the antibiotic fluorescence response. Clean-up and preconcentration steps allowed for a good linear correlation in a concentration range between 50 and 1000 ng/mL for the ofloxacin, detection and quantification limits being 10.7 and 35.5 ng/mL, respectively. Optimal CE conditions for the seven-fluoroquinolone separation method were assessed in terms of buffer type, pH, and voltage. The selective interaction of GQDs with ofloxacin as model analyte was subsequently studied finding a significant sensitivity improvement; therefore, the analytes would be detected at low concentrations by means of a commercial CE device equipped with a multi-wavelength photoluminescence detector. Due to the different maximum emission wavelengths of the target compounds and the limitations shown by the single-wavelength photoluminescence detector coupled to the CE system, we demonstrated the usefulness of the GQD-assisted sensitivity-enhanced CE method to determine ofloxacin in milk samples. This work opens an interesting possibility of using GQDs in separation techniques combined with photoluminescence detectors for lowering sensitivity levels typically provided by the mere device.",Reasons for successful clinical outcome following pulmonary vein isolation despite lack of persistent LA-PV conduction block.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116439,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2019 06 04,"The mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF) induction and maintenance, including those involved in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, are not completely known; this limits our ablation strategies and prevents us from understanding what we are actually doing when performing pulmonary vein isolation.

A previous study in our lab indicated that Solanum muricatum (SM) extract promoted osteogenic differentiation by upregulating Wnt and BMP signaling pathway in rat bone marrow stromal cells. The osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) mouse model was used in order to further discover the osteogenic properties of SM extract in the present research. We utilized microCT analysis to collect bone mass and microarchitectural parameters at vertebrae and at femur metaphysis in OI mice. Raman spectrometry was applied to identify change of bone mineral and matrix composition during SM treatment. Finally, collagen synthesis marker PINP and collagen degradation marker CTX were detected using enzyme immunoassay. SM extract could improve the bone mass and microarchitectural parameters both at vertebrae and at femur metaphysis. It also significantly increased the collagen content by promoting its biosynthesis and inhibiting its degradation. By using heterozygous Col1a1Jrt /+ mice as a model of OI, 6 weeks treatment of SM extract could significantly ameliorate the symptoms in OI mice. Thus, SM holds potential for developing new drugs of bone formation and bone remodeling.",The Influence of Evidence on Animal Cruelty Prosecution and Case Outcomes: Results of a Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116432,Journal of forensic sciences,2019 05 22,"Two hundred prosecuting attorneys completed a survey concerning priorities in taking on animal cruelty cases and the factors that help or hinder prosecuting such cases.

Results showed that prosecutors most frequently relied upon ""traditional"" sources of evidence, including detailed medical and crime scene reports and good quality photographic evidence. Other sources of forensic evidence such as DNA, computer forensics, forensic accounting, blood, and trace evidence were rarely employed. Veterinary forensic evidence, including forensic necropsies and detailed medical reports, was viewed as an important factor by a majority of prosecutors in deciding whether to accept a case for prosecution and in achieving a successful outcome, but a need for additional training for investigators was indicated.","The Use of Roche, Wainer, and Thissen's Skeletal Maturity of the Knee.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116431,Journal of forensic sciences,2019 05 31,"The Roche, Wainer, and Thissen (RWT) knee method was designed to assess maturity in living individuals, but is infrequently cited in studies of skeletal measures for legal age thresholds or estimation of age-at-death for forensic cases.

The modes of transition to full skeletal maturity are 18.37 and 17.16 years for males and females. The corresponding Bayes factors are 5.73 and 1.77, indicating that complete skeletal maturity of the knee does not provide conclusive evidence of attainment of 18 years of age.",Bamboo Leaf Flavonoids Extracts Alleviate Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells via Naturally Modulating Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Defense Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116430,Journal of food science,2019 06 13,"In this study, bamboo leaf flavonoids extracts (BFE) were employed to alleviate oxidative stress induced by oleic acid in HepG2 cells. Biochemical indexes, intracellular reactive oxygen species production, lipid droplets accumulation, antioxidant enzymes production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined to show the alleviation performance of BFE intervention (P < 0.05). Importantly, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot determination indicated that BFE intervention upregulated the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 to initiate the antioxidant defense response for counteracting oxidative stress (P < 0.05). Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential-mediated apoptosis and FOXO signaling pathway initiation caused by BFE intervention may together contribute to oxidative stress alleviation in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, these findings suggested that BFE intervention upregulated related antioxidant defense responses for preventing cells from oxidative damage. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, bamboo leaf flavonoids extracts intervention upregulated related antioxidant defense responses for preventing cells from oxidative damage. These findings in bamboo leaf extracts antioxidants are a promising and innovative subject with practical applications to enhance the development of bamboo leaf extracts functional products in the food industry."

We prospectively assessed the associations of dairy products (total, milk, butter, cheese and yogurt) and their major components (calcium, vitamin D, fats and protein) with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development among 51,418 men and 93,427 women in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and the Nurses' Health Study. Diets were collected at baseline and updated every 4 years using validated food frequency questionnaires. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression model. During up to 32 years of follow-up, a total of 164 hepatocellular carcinoma cases were documented. After adjustment for most known hepatocellular carcinoma risk factors, higher total dairy product intake was associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (highest vs. lowest tertile, HR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.19-2.88; ptrend = 0.009).

ELOVL6 mediates elongation of anteiso-15:0→anteiso-17:0, while ELOVL3 is active toward iso-18:0→iso-20:0. Competition studies reveal n-16:0 competes with anteiso-15:0 for ELOVL6, while n-18:0 competes with iso-18:0 for ELOVL3.

Acute neurogenic control of heart rate is achieved locally, through direct neuro-cardiac coupling at specific junctional sites (Neuro-Cardiac Junctions). The ventricular sympathetic network topology is well-defined and characteristic for each mammalian species. Here, we used cell size regulation to determine whether long-term modulation of cardiac structure is achieved via direct sympatho-cardiac coupling. Local density of cardiac innervation correlated with cell size throughout the myocardial walls in all mammalian species analysed, including humans. The data supports that constitutive neurogenic control of cardiomyocyte trophism occurs through direct intercellular signaling at Neuro-Cardiac Junctions.",Adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) protein expression is regulated by alternative polyadenylation and microRNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116411,FEBS letters,2019 06 04,"The post-transcriptional events regulating expression of the adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) protein are poorly understood.

Luciferase assay revealed that expression of the two isoforms with short and long 3'UTRs is differentially controlled. Further analyses showed that the short isoform displays higher translation efficiency and that miR-2428/664a reduces expression of the long isoform, indicating that APA-mediated shortening of the AAMDC 3'UTR renders the short isoform insusceptible to miRNA-mediated suppression due to loss of the binding sites for miR-2428/664a. Finally, we demonstrate that the short AAMDC isoform promotes bovine preadipocyte differentiation.

Allografting has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy for peripheral nerve injury. Moreover, cryopreservation may provide almost unlimited graft material. We investigated whether cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) could protect peripheral nerves during cryopreservation to promote regeneration postoperation. First, CIRP was highly expressed after pretreatment at 32°C. After 4 weeks of cryopreservation, the increased live cells, low Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and high nerve growth factor and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the 32°C group demonstrated high nerve graft viability. At 4 weeks postoperation, 32°C-Allo group demonstrated low plasma levels of interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma and a diminished cellular immune response. At 20 weeks postoperation, nerve regeneration in the 32°C-Allo group was similar to that in the fresh isograft group and superior to that in the 4°C-Allo and 15°C-Allo groups. Moreover, the compound muscle action potential and the motor nerve conduction velocity of the 32°C-Allo group were equal to those of the fresh isograft group. In conclusion, CIRP induction increased Schwann cell biological activity, inhibited cell apoptosis, reduced immune rejection, and promoted recipient nerve regeneration. Thus, CIRP could exert protective effects during nerve storage and stimulate regeneration in peripheral nerve reconstruction.",How well do we understand the basis of classic selective sweeps in humans?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116407,FEBS letters,2019 06 11,"Classic selective sweeps occur when positive selection increases a variant's frequency from low to high in a population, and underlie some long-studied human characteristics such as variation in skin, hair or eye colour.

Signatures of classic sweeps have more recently been detected in population-genetic data independently of any prior information about the corresponding phenotype or selective force, and usually without suggesting any insights into these. Motivated by the need to understand such candidates, we first review the gold standards and show that our understanding of them is often incomplete or unconvincing; only two of the examples we consider are compellingly explained. We assess approaches for large-scale association of classic sweep candidate variants to phenotypes and selective forces, test these on the gold standards, and discuss the standards of evidence needed to adequately understand a selective sweep.",Two DevBCA-like ABC transporters are involved in the multidrug resistance of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp.

We used data from CHL to estimate CE dose and examine its association with a successful outcome from CHL-reduction in children's recreational screen time. Monthly reports from nine intervention communities were quantified, and CE dose was calculated for each community overall, at 4 time intervals (6, 12, 18, and 24 months), and for each CE building block-social bonding, social bridging, social leveraging, empowerment, and civic engagement. CE dose at each time interval and change in screen time was correlated using Spearman's rho. Next, communities were categorized as having a high CE dose or a low CE dose, and differences between four high-dose and five low-dose communities were compared using a two-tailed t-test. The correlation between change in screen time and CE dose was significant (rs = 0.83, p = .003). Significantly more activities facilitating empowerment and civic engagement were conducted in high-dose communities, which were more likely to show improvements in screen time, than in low-dose communities. This method of estimating an intervention's CE dose and examining change over time and effect of CE and its building blocks on intervention outcomes shows promise."

The most common approach to estimating these influences is via the calculation of heritabilities, which summarize the contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic variation. Heritabilities also indicate the relative effect of genetic variation on phenotypes versus that of environmental sources of variation. For labile traits like behavioral responses, life history traits, and physiological responses, estimation of heritabilities is important as these traits are strongly influenced by the environment. Thus, knowing whether or not genetic variation is present within populations is necessary to understand whether or not these populations can evolve in response to selection. Here we report the results of a meta-analysis summarizing what we currently know about the heritability of behavior. Using phylogenetically controlled methods we assessed the average heritability of behavior (0.235)-which is similar to that reported in previous analyses of physiological and life history traits-and examined differences among taxa, behavioral classifications, and other biologically relevant factors. We found that there was considerable variation among behaviors as to how heritable they were, with migratory behaviors being the most heritable. Interestingly, we found no effect of phylogeny on estimates of heritability. These results suggest, first, that behavior may not be particularly unique in the degree to which it is influenced by factors other than genetics and, second, that those factors influencing whether a behavioral trait will have low or high heritability require further consideration.",SureTypeSC - A Random Forest and Gaussian Mixture predictor of high confidence genotypes in single cell data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116387,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2019 05 22,"Accurate genotyping of DNA from a single cell is required for applications such as de novo mutation detection, linkage analysis and lineage tracing. However, achieving high precision genotyping in the single cell environment is challenging due to the errors caused by whole genome amplification.

The lack of a comprehensive single cell dataset with a reference genotype and the absence of genotyping tools specifically designed to detect noise from the whole genome amplification step.

Inflexibility and casuistry are a consequence of this philosophy which vainly tries to give a foundation to duty. For modern philosophy, the first thing is the law, the principles from which obligations arise. Classical philosophy, on the other hand, penetrates into the nature of man and thus knows, better and better each day, the true good for the human person. It is a question of manifesting the ""must be"" from the ""being,"" the ethics from the knowledge of the metaphysics of the act of being, thus overcoming the ""naturalist fallacy."" The appreciation and respect of the person as a subject who possesses a supreme value is what underpins this anthropologically-based ethics. Based on the foundation of ethics and bioethics in the philosophy of the being and anthropology, but not limited exclusively to a bioethical approach that disregards the contributions of other currents. For the study of medicine, we propose a humanistic plan that includes courses in philosophy, anthropology, ethics, and bioethics. This plan is mainly worked on in the early years of training but continues throughout the study of medical sciences and is completes, at the end, with the clinical courses. At the same time, the proposal goes beyond the teaching of the subjects per se and goes across the entire curriculum. The integral education that is sought for the medical student is not obtained only with the existence of certain subjects or credits, but it is guaranteed by the teaching work of all.","[Antimicrobial resistance of uropathogens in older adults in a private clinic in Lima, Peru].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116345,Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,2019 05 22,"The main mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are described using the Vitek® 2 system in uropathogens isolated in older adults from a private clinic in Lima.

A validated method of visible ultraviolet spectrophotometry was used to determine the dissolution profile. The similarity factor (f2) was used to establish the therapeutic equivalence, being considered equivalent if the values of f2 were between 50 and 100. For doxycycline, the four drugs were equivalent in vitro to the RP; for amoxicillin, only two drugs were equivalent in vitro to the RP; and for fluconazole, none was equivalent in vitro to the RP. It is concluded that some amoxicillin and fluconazole drugs circulating in the national market do not meet the therapeutic equivalence assessed by in vitro studies; in other words, they are not interchangeable.","[Clinical-epidemiological characteristics and prescribing patterns for burns in three hospitals in Lima, Peru].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116341,Revista peruana de medicina experimental y salud publica,2019 05 22,"In order to describe the clinical-epidemiological characteristics and medical prescription patterns of patients with first- and second-degree burns who visited three reference hospitals in Lima, a cross-sectional study was carried out to collect data on demographics, medical history, clinical evaluation, and treatment received by 561 participants.

In each group, 14 specimens were analyzed microscopically after hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis of c-Kit and tryptase expression. Results revealed that the number and density of mast cells is different in follicular tissues according to the eruption phase, which may mean that: 1) masticatory trauma of the oral mucosa and dental follicles in the submucosa may explain why reduced enamel epithelium exposes enamel to the cells of the connective tissue; 2) exposure of antigenic enamel proteins might correspond to the release of sequestered antigens, which may lead to the interaction of IgE and a greater number of mast cells in the region; and 3) the consequent degranulation and the local release of mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, proteases, cytokines and growth factors, contribute to the understanding of signs and symptoms associated with tooth eruption.",The in vitro remineralizing effect of CPP-ACP and CPP-ACPF after 6 and 12 weeks on initial caries lesion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116280,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2019 06 13,"The aim of this in vitro study was to determine the effects of remineralization promoting agents containing casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), or CPP-ACP in combination with fluoride (CPP-ACPF) on artificial white spot lesions (WSLs) after 6 and 12 weeks.",Comparison of in vivo and in vitro models to evaluate pulp temperature rise during exposure to a Polywave® LED light curing unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116279,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2019 06 13,"To measure and compare in vivo and in vitro pulp temperature (PT) increase (ΔTEMP) over baseline, physiologic temperature using the same intact upper premolars exposed to the same Polywave® LED curing light.",Clinical and x-ray oral evaluation in patients with congenital Zika Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116278,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2019 06 13,"The aim of this study was to investigate possible malformations in the soft, bone and/or dental tissues in patients with congenital Zika Virus (ZIKV) by clinical and x-ray evaluation."

Cannabis use prevalence in Brazil is lower than in high-use regions in the Americas (e.g., North America), but concentrated among young people. Frameworks for cannabis control are increasingly shifting towards public health-oriented principles, with some countries undertaking respective policy reforms. These frameworks require a continuum of population-level interventions (e.g., prevention and treatment) including targeted prevention of adverse health outcomes among users. In this context, and based on examples from other health fields, an international expert group developed the evidence-based Lower-Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines (LRCUG), originally for Canada, including a set of 10 recommendations based on systematic data reviews and expert consensus methods. The LRCUG form a scientific population-health prevention tool to reduce adverse public health impacts for broad application among cannabis users. In Canada, the LRCUG have been formally endorsed and are supported by leading national health organizations and government authorities within the continuum of cannabis interventions. As the LRCUG are being internationalized, this paper introduces the LRCUG's concept and content - including their original recommendations translated into Portuguese - to the Brazilian context as an evidence-based population-level intervention tool for uptake, dissemination, and discussion.

The aim of this research was to investigate whether Uncaria rhynchophylla alkaloid extract (URE), a highly safe anti-inflammation constituent of the herb, can inhibit inflammation and improve clinical characteristics of preeclampsia in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preeclampsia rat model. The rat model was established by daily administration of LPS (1 μg/kg body weight per day) from gestational day (GD) 14 to 19. Different doses of URE (35, 70, and 140 mg/kg body weight per day) were administered from GD 14 to GD 19. The effects of URE on proteinuria, maternal hypertension, pregnancy outcomes, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in serum and placenta were measured. High-dose URE (HURE) treatment decreased LPS-induced mean 24-h proteinuria and systolic blood pressure, and increased fetal weight, placental weight, and the number of live pups (P<0.05). Moreover, increased serum and placental levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ in the LPS-treated group were obviously inhibited after HURE administration (P<0.01).

MIE improved the cardiac function of SHRs by decreasing left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and first derivation of LVP (+LVdP/dtmax and -LVdP/dtmax). In addition, exercise-induced beneficial effects in SHRs were mediated by decreasing damage to myocardial mitochondrial morphology, decreasing production of reactive oxygen species, increasing glutathione level, decreasing oxidized glutathione level, increasing expression of SIRT3/SOD2, and increasing activity of superoxide dismutase. Exercise training in SHRs improved cardiac function by inhibiting hypertension-induced myocardial mitochondrial damage and attenuating oxidative stresses, offering new insights into prevention and treatment of hypertension.",Linderae radix ethanol extract attenuates alcoholic liver injury via attenuating inflammation and regulating gut microbiota in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116255,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,2019 06 10,"This study aimed to explore the influence of gut microbiota alterations induced by Linderae radix ethanol extract (LREE) on alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in rats and to study the anti-inflammatory effect of LREE on ALD through the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. ALD rat models were established by intragastric liquor [50% (v/v) ethanol] administration at 10 mL/kg body weight for 20 days. Rats were divided into six groups: normal group (no treatment), model group (ALD rats), Essentiale group (ALD rats fed with Essentiale, 137 mg/kg), and LREE high/moderate/low dose groups (ALD rats fed with 4, 2, or 1 g LREE/kg). NF-κB and LPS levels were evaluated. Liver pathological changes and intestinal ultrastructure were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. The gut microbiota composition was evaluated by 16S rDNA sequencing. Expression levels of TLR4 and CD68 in liver tissue, and occludin and claudin-1 in intestinal tissue were measured. LREE treatment significantly reduced NF-κB and LPS levels, improved liver pathological changes, and ameliorated intestinal ultrastructure injury. Meanwhile, LREE-fed groups showed a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes than the rats in the model group. Administration of LREE suppressed TLR4 overexpression and promoted the expression of occludin and claudin-1 in intestine tissue. Thus, LREE could partly ameliorate microflora dysbiosis, suppress the inflammatory response, and attenuate liver injury in ALD rats. The protective effect of LREE might be related to the LPS-TLR4-NF-κB pathway."

This article is the first to systematically evaluate this relationship. A comprehensive worldwide search was conducted for relevant literature on surfactant-associated protein D gene mutations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk prediction. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. After four genetic models (the allele, additive, recessive, and dominant models) were identified, odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis included 659 individuals in the case group and 597 in the control group. In the Asian population, none of the four genetic models revealed any significant association between rs2243639 genotype and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In Caucasians, however, the recessive model exhibited significant risk associated with rs2243639. Furthermore, there was a significant association between rs721917 genotype and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Asian population. In contrast, none of the four gene models revealed any significant risk associated with this gene in the Caucasian population. This meta-analysis suggests that rs2243639 is not related to the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Asian population but is related to this risk in the Caucasian population.

In the past, LOV domain variants have been developed as fluorescent reporter proteins (called flavin-based fluorescent proteins; FbFPs), which due to their ability to fluoresce under anaerobic conditions, fast folding kinetics and a small size of ∼12-16 kDa are a promising reporter system for quantitative real-time analysis of biological processes. Here, we present a small thermostable flavin-based fluorescent protein CagFbFP derived from a soluble LOV domain-containing histidine kinase from the thermophilic bacterium Chloroflexus aggregans. CagFbFP is composed of 107 amino acids with a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa and consists only of the conserved LOV core domain. The protein is thermostable with a melting point of about 68 °C. It crystallizes easily and its crystals diffract to 1.07 Å. Both the crystal structure and small angle scattering data show that the protein is a dimer. Unexpectedly, glutamine 148, which in LOV photoreceptor proteins is the key residue responsible for signal transduction, occupies two conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the two conformations interconvert rapidly. The crystal structure of the wild-type Chloroflexus aggregans LOV domain determined at 1.22 Å resolution confirmed the presence of two alternative conformations of the glutamine 148 side chain. Overall, this protein, due to its stability and ease of crystallization, appears to be a promising model for ultra-high resolution structural studies of LOV domains and for application as a fluorescent reporter.",Polarizable embedding for simulating redox potentials of biomolecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116217,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 14,"Redox reactions play a key role in various biological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. Quantitative and predictive computational characterization of redox events is therefore highly desirable for enriching our knowledge on mechanistic features of biological redox-active macromolecules. Here, we present a computational protocol exploiting polarizable embedding hybrid quantum-classical approach and resulting in accurate estimates of redox potentials of biological macromolecules. A special attention is paid to fundamental aspects of the theoretical description such as the effects of environment polarization and of the long-range electrostatic interactions on the computed energetic parameters. Environment (protein and the solvent) polarization is shown to be crucial for accurate estimates of the redox potential: hybrid quantum-classical results with and without account for environment polarization differ by 1.4 V. Long-range electrostatic interactions are shown to contribute significantly to the computed redox potential value even at the distances far beyond the protein outer surface. The approach is tested on simulating reduction potential of cryptochrome 1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.

A clear difference was found between the samples which were seeded with nanodiamond and the ones not seeded before growth. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the excellent quality of the diamond film. Dielectric measurements showed an increase in the dielectric constant of the material after diamond growth. The diamond was also doped with boron to make it superconducting.

In water-based syntheses, MOFs with three different topologies, denoted as UiO-66 (fcu), CAU-41 (bcu) and CAU-44 (bct), were obtained within 30 min under mild reaction conditions. The MOFs were fully characterized and their structures were refined from PXRD data. The chirality of the incorporated linker molecules was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The optical activities were also investigated by second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements.

The electronic coupling between the BDP chromophore and an electron-donating carbazole (Carb) moiety was tuned by attachment via the meso and the beta positions on the BDP core, and through the use of various chemical linkers (phenyl and alkynyl) to afford mesoBDP-Carb, mesoBDP-phen-Carb, and betaBDP-alk-Carb. meso-Substituted dyads were found to retain ground-state absorption features of the unsubstituted BDP. However, variation of the linkage between the donor and acceptor moieties modulated the photophysical behavior of excited-state deactivation by controlling the rate of photoinduced internal charge transfer (ICT). The beta-substituted dyad dramatically tuned (red shifted) the absorption spectrum, while retaining desired features of the BDP, specifically stability and high extinction coefficients, however the ICT kinetics were accelerated compared to the meso-substituted dyads. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) were carried out on the six potential dyads formed between BDP and Carb (attachment using the beta and meso positions for all three connections: direct, phenyl and alkynyl) to support the experimental observations. DFT and TDDFT showed molecular orbital density spread across the HOMO level only when attachment occurred through the beta position of BDP. In the meso-substituted BDP-Carb dyads, the molecular orbitals resembled those of the unsubstituted BDP. This work reveals several possible synthetic paradigms to tune photophysical properties with directed synthetic modifications and provides a mechanistic understanding of the ground- and excited- state behavior in these small-molecule donor-acceptor dyads.",Heterostructured NiFe oxide/phosphide nanoflakes for efficient water oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116198,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 06 13,"To realise the gradual replacement of noble metal-based materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion, numerous studies need to be focused on the compounds based on inexpensive 3d transition metals (such as Fe and Co).

Hence, to overcome such shortcomings, we propose here an immobilization-free and label-free PEC aptasensor using solution-phase methylene blue (MB) as the PEC signal probe. Based on the unique T-Hg2+-T base pairs, and the diffusivity difference between free MB molecules and the MB/G-quadruplex composite towards the ITO electrode surface with negative charge, the ""signal-off"" approach for Hg2+ detection is developed. In the presence of target Hg2+, via the T-Hg2+-T bond formation, the two sticky ends of the hairpin DNA probe form a rigid duplex stem, which triggers the exonuclease III-facilitated target cycling amplification, and the formation of multiple G-quadruplexes. Upon the intercalation of MB in G-quadruplexes, significantly decreased photocurrent is obtained owing to the increased electrostatic repulsion between the MB/G-quadruplex composite and the ITO electrode. Therefore, highly sensitive and ultrasensitive Hg2+ determination is achieved, with a low detection limit of 1.2 pM, well below the maximum allowable Hg2+ level in drinking water defined by the WHO, China's Ministry of Health, and the US EPA. Due to the avoidance of sophisticated electrode modification and recognition probe immobilization processes, as well as an expensive labeling procedure, the PEC aptasensor proposed here demonstrates the advantages of simplicity, good reproducibility, rapidness and low cost.",Inkjet-printed micro-calibration standards for ultraquantitative Raman spectral cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116195,The Analyst,2019 06 13,"Herein we report the development of a cytometric analysis platform for measuring the contents of individual cells in absolute (picogram) scales; this study represents the first report of Raman-based quantitation of the absolute mass - or the total amount - of multiple endogenous biomolecules within single-cells. To enable ultraquantitative calibration, we engineered single-cell-sized micro-calibration standards of known composition by inkjet-printer deposition of biomolecular components in microarrays across the surface of silicon chips. We demonstrate clinical feasibility by characterizing the compositional phenotype of human skin fibroblast and porcine alveolar macrophage cell populations in the respective contexts of Niemann-Pick disease and drug-induced phospholipidosis: two types of lipid storage disorders.

Gallium acts as an iron mimic and disturbs iron-dependent propagation and other processes in tumor cells. However, the toxicity of gallium was also well documented in vitro and in vivo in animals. Though the oral administration of gallium in humans is less toxic, it has also been shown that a long period of administration could induce tumor fibrosis. Chromium (Cr), a naturally occurring heavy metal, is commonly used in industrial processes and can cause severe health problems in humans. It has been found to be closely involved in the metabolism of nucleic acids, proteins and fats in humans. Cr(iii) salts can be used as micronutrients and dietary supplements. However, similar to gallium (Ga3+), chromium (Cr3+) can build up to an excessive degree that is harmful to the human body. Therefore, it would be of great interest to develop chemosensing for the selective and sensitive detection of gallium and chromium ions in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we reported that an NBD-based (4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) fluorescent probe (NBDT) was fabricated with demonstrated extraordinary specificity and sensitivity. A swift response toward Ga3+ and Cr3+ ions was discovered using fluorescence enhancement over a wide pH range and with cycle stability. Furthermore, lighted up by Ga3+ and Cr3+ ions in vitro, this NBDT sensor was successfully applied to detect exogenous Ga3+ and Cr3+ ions in MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells. Additionally, using zebrafish as the in vivo model, we demonstrated the capability of this NBDT for detecting and imaging Ga3+ and Cr3+ ions in zebrafish. Taken together, this NBDT has indicated great potential for detecting and monitoring Ga3+ and Cr3+ ions in vitro and in vivo.",Application of novel solid phase extraction-NMR protocols for metabolic profiling of human urine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116193,Faraday discussions,2019 05 22,"Metabolite identification and annotation procedures are necessary for the discovery of biomarkers indicative of phenotypes or disease states, but these processes can be bottlenecked by the sheer complexity of biofluids containing thousands of different compounds.

Slowing myopia by 1 diopter may do just that for myopic maculopathy-the most common and serious sight-threatening complication of myopia. There is a growing interest in slowing the progression of myopia due to its increasing prevalence around the world, the sight-threatening consequences of higher levels of myopia, and the growing evidence-based literature supporting a variety of therapies for its control. We apply data from five large population-based studies of the prevalence of myopic maculopathy on 21,000 patients. We show that a 1-diopter increase in myopia is associated with a 67% increase in the prevalence of myopic maculopathy. Restated, slowing myopia by 1 diopter should reduce the likelihood of a patient developing myopic maculopathy by 40%. Furthermore, this treatment benefit accrues regardless of the level of myopia. Thus, while the overall risk of myopic maculopathy is higher in a -6-diopter myope than in a -3-diopter myope, slowing their myopic progression by 1 diopter during childhood should lower the risk by 40% in both.",Semaphorin-5A downregulation is associated with enhanced migration and invasion of BRAF-positive melanoma cells under vemurafenib treatment in melanomas with heterogeneous BRAF status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116162,Melanoma research,2019 05 22,"Tumor heterogeneity affects the efficacy of anticancer treatment as tumor subclones with distinct molecular patterns may be present within one tumor, leading to differing sensitivities to chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, six melanoma tissue fragments were obtained from different parts of tumor of four patients and then the effect of vemurafenib treatment on biological characteristics and molecular processes of cell cultures was estimated by using MTT-test, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays, PCR real time. There was different BRAF status determined between cells derived from the central and peripheral regions of primary melanoma tumors. BRAF-positive melanoma cells showed an increased apoptotic rate under vemurafenib treatment, as well as increased migration and invasion rates, whereas BRAF-negative melanoma cells did not exhibit such tendency. Furthermore, semaphorin-5A levels were diminished in BRAF-positive cells, but not in BRAF-negative ones, which could be related to increased migration and invasion. Melanoma cells derived from different regions of the same tumor may differ by mutations status, molecular processes and biological response to target therapy. The downregulation of semaphorin-5A may be involved in divergent effects of anticancer agents on tumor cell biology.",Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog mRNA is differentially spliced to give five distinct isoforms: implications for melanoma therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116161,Melanoma research,2019 05 22,"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog is a commonly mutated oncogene in melanoma, and therapeutic targeting of neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog has proven difficult. We characterized the expression and phenotypic functions of five recently discovered splice isoforms of neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog in melanoma. Canonical neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (isoform-1) was expressed to the highest degree and its expression was significantly increased in melanoma metastases compared to primary lesions. Isoform-5 expression in metastases showed a significant, positive correlation with survival and tumours over-expressing isoform-5 had significantly decreased growth in a xenograft model. In contrast, over-expression of any isoform resulted in enhanced proliferation, and invasiveness was increased with over-expression of isoform-1 or isoform-2. Downstream signalling analysis indicated that the isoforms signalled differentially through the mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K pathways and A375 cells over-expressing isoform-2 or isoform-5 showed resistance to vemurafenib treatment in vitro. The neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog isoforms appear to play varying roles in melanoma phenotype and could potentially serve as biomarkers for therapeutic response and disease prognosis.",Exploring metabolic reprogramming in melanoma via acquired resistance to the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor phenformin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116160,Melanoma research,2019 05 22,"Therapeutic failures in cancer therapy are often associated with metabolic plasticity. The use of metabolic modulators as anti-cancer agents has been effective in correcting metabolic alterations; however, molecular events behind metabolic switch are still largely unexplored. Herein, we characterize the molecular and functional events that follow prolonged oxidative phosphorylation inhibition by phenformin in order to study how melanoma cells adapt to this specific metabolic pressure. We show that melanoma cells cultured up to 3 months with high doses of phenformin (R-cells) are less viable and migrate and invade less than parental (S-) cells. Microarray analysis of R-melanoma cells reveals a switch in the energy production strategy accompanied by the modulation of several immunological-associated genes. R-cells display low oxygen consumption rate and high basal extracellular acidification rate. When treated with vemurafenib, R-cell viability, growth and extracellular signal-regulated kinases activation decrease. Finally, phenformin withdrawal reverts R-cells phenotype. In summary, our study provides an in vitro model of on-off metabolic switch in melanoma and reveals interesting molecular signatures controlling metabolic reprogramming in this tumour."

However, little is known about community as a concept among people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings and stakeholders' interactions and engagement in NCDs prevention and management. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand; (1) the meaning of community among people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs in Region Stockholm and (2) how communities interact and engage with stakeholders at local and regional levels for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in three municipalities in Region Stockholm with a high proportion of migrants. Multiple data collection methods were used, including observations of community activities; interviews with community members, representatives of public authorities and NGOs; and group interviews with healthcare providers. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Community was perceived as living in close proximity with shared beliefs, values and resources. Although they recognized its social and cultural diversity, community members focused more on the commonalities of living in their neighborhood and less on their differences in country of birth and languages spoken. Several mismatches between awareness of community needs and the available skills and resources among stakeholders for T2D prevention were identified. Stakeholders expressed awareness of T2D risk and interest in addressing it in a culturally appropriate manner. Conclusion: Interaction between the communities and stakeholders was limited, as was engagement in T2D prevention and management. This highlights barriers in the collaboration between community, healthcare institutions and other stakeholders which consequently affect the implementation of preventive interventions. Innovative ways to link the community to the healthcare sector and other local government institutions are needed to build the capacity of health systems for T2D prevention in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.",Weight among children born 2005-2011 in Nuuk at the time of school entry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116095,International journal of circumpolar health,2019 06 10,"The aim of this study was to explore weight status among children born between 2005-2011 at the time of their school entry in Nuuk, and separately to compare weight status between Nuuk and the rest of Greenland among children born in 2011.

Among children born in 2011, the prevalence of overweight or obesity was 14.6% in Nuuk, compared to 28.8% in the rest of Greenland (p < 0.001). The prevalence of overweight and obesity was stable for children living in Nuuk. A higher prevalence was observed among children living outside Nuuk. Continued monitoring of weight status is recommended.

Throughout his career, Davy used analogical reasoning to direct and to interpret his experimental analyses of the chemical reactions between substances. In his writing, he deployed analogies to organise and to explain his theories about the relations between physical processes and between the properties of different chemical elements and compounds. But Davy also regularly expressed two concerns about analogical comparison: first, that it was founded not on the rational interpretation of facts but on imaginative speculation; and second, that it was a kind of rhetoric, the persuasiveness of which depended not on material evidence but on misleading figures of speech. This article discusses the influences that informed Davy's ambivalent assessment of the value of analogy, and it examines the distinct yet overlapping ways in which this assessment was expressed in his notebooks, his lectures and treatises on chemistry, his philosophical writings, and his poetry.","How Social Welfare and Health Professionals Understand ""Race,"" Racism, and Whiteness: A Social Justice Approach to Grounded Theory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116092,Social work in public health,2019 05 22,"Social welfare and health professionals continually practice within communities, either directly as practitioners or indirectly by supervising students and co-workers. The current study investigated how social welfare and health professionals conceptualized race, racism, and whiteness in health disparities discourse. Employing constructivist grounded theory, through a social justice lens, the researchers developed a theoretical model based upon the collective experiences of social workers, nurses, and physicians. The analysis revealed four theoretical categories that characterized facets of how social welfare and health professionals' understand race, racism, and whiteness: (1) self-defined skin color; (2) (pre)judgments and discrimination; (3) privilege and power; and (4) conceptual conflation and unfamiliarity. The findings suggest more emphasis during training and in workplace settings on concepts such as power, inequities, and structural racism may significantly improve the efficacy and scope of REHD interventions by expanding social welfare and health professionals' understanding of race, racism, and whiteness beyond interpersonal level interactions.","Brain serotonin in high-fat diet-induced weight gain, anxiety and spatial memory in rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116091,Nutritional neuroscience,2019 05 22,"Effects of high-fat diet (HFD) consumption on body weight gain and its consequences on anxiety, learning and memory, and serotonin metabolism (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in the hypothalamus and hippocampus are determined in rats.",Circular RNA 0001785 regulates the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma as a ceRNA by sponging miR-1200 to upregulate HOXB2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116090,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 06 05,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are recently emerged to be promising therapeutic targets of tumors. Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent primary bone tumor and the third most prevalent cancer in children and adolescents. This study firstly analyzed circRNA microarray of osteosarcoma and selected circ-0001785 as the study object. We aimed to comprehensively investigate the expression pattern and biological function of circ-0001785 in the progression of osteosarcoma. Relative levels of circ-0001785 and miR-1200 in the normal human osteoblast cell line and osteosarcoma cell lines were determined. Bioinformatics analyses predicted the binding relationship between miR-1200 to HOXB2 and circ-0001785, while dual-luciferase reporter gene assay further verified this relationship. Flow cytometry and EdU assay were used for evaluating the regulatory effects of circ-0001785/miR-1200/HOXB2 axis on osteosarcoma cells. Consistent with the microarray analysis, circ-0001785 was highly expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of circ-0001785 attenuated proliferative ability, but induced the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that circ-0001785 competitively bound to miR-1200, thus up-regulating its target gene HOXB2. Western blot analyses revealed that circ-0001785 regulated the PI3K/Akt signaling and Bcl-2 family pathway in osteosarcoma. In conclusion, circ-0001785 regulates the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma by sponging miR-1200 to up-regulate HOXB2 expression.",Deletion of caveolin scaffolding domain alters cancer cell migration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116089,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 06 05,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is an integral membrane protein that plays an important role in proliferative and terminally differentiated cells. As a structural component of Caveolae, Cav-1 interacts with signaling molecules via a caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) regulating cell signaling. Recent reports have shown that Cav-1 is a negative regulator in tumor metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that Cav-1 inhibits cell migration through its CSD. HeLa cells were engineered to overexpress Cav-1 (Cav-1 OE), Cav-1 without a functional CSD (∆CSD), or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a control. HeLa cell migration was suppressed in Cav-1 OE cells while ∆CSD showed increased migration, which corresponded to a decrease in the tight junction protein, zonula occludens (ZO-1). The migration phenotype was confirmed in multiple cancer cell lines. Phosphorylated STAT-3 was decreased in Cav-1 OE cells compared to control and ∆CSD cells; reducing STAT-3 expression alone decreased cell migration. ∆CSD blunted HeLa proliferation by increasing the number of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Overexpressing the CSD peptide alone suppressed HeLa cell migration and inhibited pSTAT3. These findings suggest that Cav-1 CSD may be critical in controlling the dynamic phenotype of cancer cells by facilitating the interaction of specific signal transduction pathways, regulating STAT3 and participating in a G2/M checkpoint. Modulating the CSD and targeting specific proteins may offer potential new therapies in the treatment of cancer metastasis.",Feedback regulation of small RNA processing by the cleavage product.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116083,RNA biology,2019 05 22,"Many bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are processed resulting in variants with roles potentially distinct from the primary sRNAs. In Enterobacteriaceae sRNA GlmZ activates expression of glmS by base-pairing when the levels of glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) are low. GlmS synthesizes GlcN6P, which is required for cell envelope biosynthesis. When dispensable, GlmZ is cleaved by RNase E in the base-pairing sequence. Processing requires protein RapZ, which binds GlmZ and recruits RNase E by interaction. Cleavage is counteracted by the homologous sRNA GlmY, which accumulates upon GlcN6P scarcity and sequesters RapZ. Here, we report a novel role for a processed sRNA. We observed that processing of GlmZ is never complete in vivo. Even upon RapZ overproduction, a fraction of GlmZ remains full-length, while the 5' cleavage product (GlmZ*) accumulates. GlmZ* retains all elements required for RapZ binding. Accordingly, GlmZ* can displace full-length GlmZ from RapZ and counteract processing in vitro. To mimic GlmZ* in vivo, sRNA chimeras were employed consisting of foreign 3' ends including a terminator fused to the 3' end of GlmZ*. In vitro, these chimeras perform indistinguishable from GlmZ*. Expression of the chimeras in vivo inhibited processing of endogenous GlmZ, causing moderate upregulation of GlmS synthesis. Hence, accumulation of GlmZ* prevents complete GlmZ turnover. This mechanism may serve to adjust a robust glmS basal expression level that is buffered against fluctuations in RapZ availability.",Are there two independent evaluative conditioning effects in relational paradigms? Dissociating the effects of CS-US pairings and their meaning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116082,Cognition & emotion,2019 05 22,"Recent research into evaluative conditioning (EC) shows that information about the relationship between the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli can exert strong effects on the size and direction of the EC effect. Additionally, the co-occurrence of these stimuli seems to exert an orthogonal effect on evaluations. This finding has been interpreted as support for two independent types of EC effects. However, previous research devoted to this question relied on aggregated evaluative measures, allowing for alternative interpretations. In four experiments, we developed and validated a multinomial processing tree model that distinguishes effects of the pairings from effects of the meaning of the pairings. Our findings suggest that two independent EC effects contribute to overall evaluative change in a relational EC paradigm. The model that we developed offers a helpful method for future research in that it allows for an assessment of the effects of manipulations on processes rather than overall performance on an evaluative measure.",Lifestyle-based modifiable risk factors in multiple sclerosis: review of experimental and clinical findings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116081,Neurodegenerative disease management,2019 05 22,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a lifelong inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease influenced by multiple lifestyle-based factors.

In contrast, obesity and comorbid cardiovascular diseases are associated with increased MS susceptibility and worse disease progression. In addition, the potential influence of smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption on MS onset and disability development are discussed. Successful management of the modifiable risk factors may lead to better long-term outcomes and improve patients' quality of life. MS specialists should participate in educating and facilitating lifestyle-based modifications as part of their neurological consults."

Objectives: This study aimed to assess potential impacts of e-cigarette price changes on vaping and smoking behaviors by smoking status (current, former, and never smokers) and e-cigarette type (pre-filled only vs. refillable). Methods: A total of 918 US-based adult e-cigarette users completed an online survey, designed to assess behavioral intention of e-cigarette/cigarette use in hypothetical situations with varying prices of e-cigarettes, in 2017. Results: With reduction in e-cigarette prices, more than 50% of current smokers reported they would reduce or quit smoking, but with greater increases in price, the rates of not only those who would quit (12.5-19.4%), but also those who would increase smoking rose (15.1-25.1%). Current smokers (vs. former/never) were more likely to increase e-cigarette use at reduced e-cigarette prices. Among current smokers, pre-filled users were less likely to quit smoking with reduced prices. At higher prices, pre-filled users were more likely to quit e-cigarettes (former smokers), but also more likely to start smoking (never smokers). Among former smokers, recent quitters were more likely to restart smoking with any e-cigarette price changes, and less likely to reduce or quit e-cigarettes with increased prices. Conclusions: Both smoking and e-cigarette use seem to be sensitive to e-cigarette price changes. Increases in e-cigarette price may have both positive and negative effects on smoking behavior, and e-cigarette price changes may disproportionately affect pre-filled users and recent quitters.",Novel Targets for Therapy of Renal Fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116064,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,2019 05 22,"Renal fibrosis is an important component of chronic kidney disease, an incurable pathology with increasing prevalence worldwide. With a lack of available therapeutic options, end-stage renal disease is currently treated with renal replacement therapy through dialysis or transplantation. In recent years, many efforts have been made to identify novel targets for therapy of renal diseases, with special focus on the characterization of unknown mediators and pathways participating in renal fibrosis development. Using experimental models of renal disease and patient biopsies, we identified four novel mediators of renal fibrosis with potential to constitute future therapeutic targets against kidney disease: discoidin domain receptor 1, periostin, connexin 43, and cannabinoid receptor 1. The four candidates were highly upregulated in different models of renal disease and were localized at the sites of injury. Subsequent studies showed that they are centrally involved in the underlying mechanisms of renal fibrosis progression. Interestingly, inhibition of either of these proteins by different strategies, including gene deletion, antisense administration, or specific blockers, delayed the progression of renal disease and preserved renal structure and function, even when the inhibition started after initiation of the disease. This review will summarize the current findings on these candidates emphasizing on their potential to constitute future targets of therapy.",Human platelets and megakaryocytes express defensin alpha 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116063,Platelets,2019 05 22,"Platelets are anucleate cells that have a role in several innate immune functions, including the secretion of proteins with antimicrobial activity. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of platelets to secrete thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal proteins and antimicrobial peptides, like hBD-1. However, the expression and secretion of defensins of the alpha family by platelets have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of defensin alpha 1 (DEFA1) in human platelets and megakaryocytes. Our data indicate that DEFA1 mRNA and protein are present in peripheral blood platelets and in the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (MEG-01). DEFA1 co-localize with α-granules of platelets and MEG-01 cells, and was also detected in cytoplasm of MEG-01 cells. The assay of our in vitro model of platelet-like particles (PLPs) revealed that MEG-01 cells could transfer DEFA1 mRNA to their differentiated PLPs. Furthermore, platelets secreted DEFA1 into the culture medium when activated with thrombin, adenosine diphosphate, and lipopolysaccharide; meanwhile, MEG-01 cells secreted DEFA1 when activated with thrombopoietin. Platelet's secreted DEFA1 can rebind to platelet's surface and have antibacterial activity against the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. In summary, our data indicate that both, human platelets and megakaryocytes, can express and secrete DEFA1. These results suggest a new role of platelets and megakaryocytes in the innate immune response.",Extracellular Matrix in Kidney Fibrosis: More Than Just a Scaffold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116062,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,2019 05 22,"Kidney fibrosis is the common histological end-point of progressive, chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) regardless of the underlying etiology. The hallmark of renal fibrosis, similar to all other organs, is pathological deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Renal ECM is a complex network of collagens, elastin, and several glycoproteins and proteoglycans forming basal membranes and interstitial space. Several ECM functions beyond providing a scaffold and organ stability are being increasingly recognized, for example, in inflammation. ECM composition is determined by the function of each of the histological compartments of the kidney, that is, glomeruli, tubulo-interstitium, and vessels. Renal ECM is a dynamic structure undergoing remodeling, particularly during fibrosis. From a clinical perspective, ECM proteins are directly involved in several rare renal diseases and indirectly in CKD progression during renal fibrosis. ECM proteins could serve as specific non-invasive biomarkers of fibrosis and scaffolds in regenerative medicine. The gold standard and currently only specific means to measure renal fibrosis is renal biopsy, but new diagnostic approaches are appearing. Here, we discuss the localization, function, and remodeling of major renal ECM components in healthy and diseased, fibrotic kidneys and the potential use of ECM in diagnostics of renal fibrosis and in tissue engineering.","Multifaceted toxin profile, an approach toward a better understanding of probiotic Bacillus cereus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116061,Critical reviews in toxicology,2019 05 22,"Strains of the Bacillus cereus group have been widely used as probiotics for human beings, food animals, plants, and environmental remediation.

Here, we summarize the state of our current knowledge about the toxins of B. cereus sensu lato to be considered for safety assessment of probiotic candidates. Surfactin-like emetic toxin (cereulide) and various enterotoxins including nonhemolytic enterotoxin, hemolysin BL, and cytotoxin K are responsible for food poisoning outbreaks characterized by emesis and diarrhea.

Each participant underwent two measurements on a posturographic device (32 Hz sampling rate) based on the Interactive Balance System (time interval: 7 d). Test procedure consisted of tests on solid ground with eyes open (1) and eyes closed (2). Data analysis included parameters of motor output and a frequency band analysis. Reliability tests were realized using by intraclass correlations (ICC). Coefficients of ICC ranged from 0.36 (95% CI: 0.01-0.73) to 0.94 (95% CI: 0.86-0.97) in both test positions.

[Method] DNA microarray analysis was performed using RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients with IgG4-RD and four healthy individuals. Genes showing a greater than 3-fold change in expression in IgG4-RD patients following steroid therapy were identified. Four genes related to innate immunity such as transcobalamin I (TCN1), secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and lactotransferrin (LTF) were assessed by real-time PCR in 15 IgG4-RD patients and 13 healthy individuals. [Result] DNA microarray analysis identified 30 genes showing a greater than 3-fold change in expression in IgG4-RD patients following steroid therapy. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the levels of mRNAs encoding TCNI and SLPI, except for BPI and LTF, were significantly lower in patients with IgG4-RD than in healthy people. The levels of all four mRNAs in patients with IgG4-RD were significantly increased after steroid treatment. [Conclusion] These results indicate that reduction in expression of innate immunity-related genes may participate in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD that steroid treatment may rectify impaired innate immunity as well as acquired immunity."

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of vascular lipids, immune system activation, inflammation, oxidative stress and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), endothelial cell (EC) activation, arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, macrophage activation and foam cell formation that cause endothelial dysfunction. DNA methylation is one of important epigenetic mechanisms which changes gene expression. It has been evident that this mechanism plays an important role in the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, DNA methylation is a crucial and distinct mechanism that modulates genes governing cell proliferation, thereby connecting environmental insults with gene expression. This study represents many atherosclerosis-related genes which are regulated through DNA methylation mechanism. Although the role of epigenetics in atherosclerosis is at their infancy. Nevertheless, various studies demonstrated that DNA methylation involvement in this disease is undeniable. DNA methyltransferases are the main player of the smooth muscle cell proliferation, endothelial cell integrity, as well as arteriosclerosis formation. In this review, we focus on recent achievements in the functional and description interpretation of the DNA methylation pattern of cells and tissues implicated in atherosclerosis. Besides, we discuss the association of DNA methylation with oxidative stress, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), ageing, and inflammation in the development and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",Declined circulating Elabela levels in patients with essential hypertension and its association with impaired vascular function: A preliminary study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116039,"Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)",2019 05 22,"Background: Elabela (ELA) is a newly identified endogenous ligand of apelin receptor (APJ) which has been confirmed to be implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Previous experiments have revealed the critical role of ELA in eliciting vasodilation and lowering blood pressure. However, the role of plasma ELA levels in hypertensive patients and its relationship with vascular function have not been investigated. Method: Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 31 age-matched healthy subjects as controls were recruited in the study. Plasma ELA concentration and vascular function parameters including brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured. Results: We observed remarkably lower plasma ELA concentration in hypertensive patients as compared with controls (1.29 ± 0.56 ng/ml vs. 1.79 ± 0.55 ng/ml; P = 0.001). Linear correlation analysis showed that ELA was negatively correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = -0.388, P = 0.002) and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.321, P = 0.011) and positively correlated with FMD (r = 0.319, P = 0.011). There was no statistically significant relationship between ELA and baPWV (r = 0.234, P = 0.067). Stepwise multiple linear analysis also identified a close association of plasma ELA levels with endothelial function. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates for the first time that circulating ELA levels are reduced in patients with EH. The fall in endogenous ELA levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension-related vascular damage.",Characteristics of metabolic factors related to arterial stiffness in young and old adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116038,"Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)",2019 05 22,"It has not been adequately studied which biomarkers for cardiovascular risk indicate changes of atherosclerosis by aging process.

Without adjustment, most parameters were significantly correlated with baPWV in both young and old groups. Mean baPWV was significantly different according to metabolic syndrome (MetS) in both groups (13.1 and 12.1 m/s in the young subjects with and without MetS, respectively; 17.4 and 15.8 m/s, respectively, in the old group). After adjusting for age, sex, and hemodynamic factors, the difference in baPWV according to MetS was significant only in the old group. The relationship between most biomarkers and baPWV was influenced by metabolic disorders such as hypertension and diabetes in old adults. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and apolipoprotein B were significant in young group. In conclusion, the metabolic biomarkers related to arterial stiffness were different between young and old adults. Contrary to old adults, TC, LDLC, and apolipoprotein B were independent biomarkers for arterial stiffness in healthy young adults.","The relationships between symptoms, disability, perceived health and quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116037,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2019 05 22,"Objectives: Using the Wilson and Cleary model linking clinical variables to quality of life, we explored the associations between physical and psychological factors, disability, perceived health and quality of life in ALS/MND. Methods: The ongoing UK study of Trajectories of Outcomes in Neurological Conditions (TONiC) recruited participants with ALS/MND to complete a questionnaire pack including demographic factors and several patient reported outcome measures (PROMs); a clinician provided data on disease onset type and duration since diagnosis. All PROMs were transformed from ordinal raw scores to interval-scaled latent estimates via the Rasch measurement model. Results: Data from 636 patients were analyzed; mean age 65.1 years (SD 10.7), 61.3% male. Median duration since diagnosis was 11.2 months (IQR 4.6-29.9; range 0.4-295.9 months); 67.3% had limb and 27.3% bulbar onset disease. Symptoms such as breathlessness and fatigue, along with most domains of activity limitations, were shown to vary by onset type. A series of models illustrated the importance of physical functioning and anxiety upon quality of life, with breathlessness and fatigue having indirect effects. The models were invariant for gender and onset type. Conclusions: This large study highlights the importance of functional status and anxiety as key variables influencing quality of life in ALS/MND. The nature and diversity of factors, both physical and psychological, which have been shown to influence the quality of life of people with ALS/MND provide strong evidence in support of the widespread implementation of multidisciplinary care.",Alantolactone induces apoptosis through ROS-mediated AKT pathway and inhibition of PINK1-mediated mitophagy in human HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116036,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 05 22,"Alantolactone (Ala), a major sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Inula helenium, exerts potent anti-tumour activities in various cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of such activities is still ambiguous. This study focused on evaluating the anti-tumour effects and molecular mechanisms of Ala on HepG2 cells. Our results demonstrated that Ala might inhibit cellular proliferation, induce G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Specifically, this study confirmed that Ala induced G2/M phase arrest by upregulating p21, downregulating cyclin A1 and cyclin B1, and promoting cellular apoptosis by increasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, Ala caused an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and inhibition of ROS production significantly prevented Ala-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the accumulation of ROS, in turn, suppressed the downstream AKT signalling. Finally, mitophagy of Ala-treated HepG2 cells was observed by Mito/Lyso staining. Mitophagy was significantly inhibited by downregulation of the expression of PINK1 and Parkin proteins. The inhibition of mitophagy by a mitophagy inhibitor was found to markedly enhance Ala-mediated apoptosis and growth inhibition in HepG2 cells. Consequently, Ala induced cellular apoptosis via ROS-mediated suppression of AKT signalling and inhibition of PINK1-mediated mitophagy. Thus, Ala has potential to be used for the treatment of liver cancer.",Meta-analysis comparing incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia with ALK inhibitors and chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116035,"Future oncology (London, England)",2019 05 22,"Aim: This meta-analysis compared incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia with ALK inhibitors versus chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

Summary incidence, relative risk and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated for grade 3-4 neutropenia. Results: Five randomized clinical trials were included. Relative risk (95% CI) of developing grade 3-4 neutropenia with ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy was 0.27 (0.07-1.06). Probabilities of developing grade 3-4 neutropenia were 6.56 and 14.19%, respectively; no significant difference was found. Conclusion: In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia with ALK-targeted therapy is not significantly different compared with chemotherapy."

A study was conducted to evaluate the relationship among physical and mechanical properties of the eggshell, as affected by breed and hen's age. 2. Data on eggshell quality (external characteristics and derived measurements) were obtained from 322 laying hens, from three breeds (Fayoumi, Dandarawi and Hy-Line Brown) during the laying cycle, starting from 38 wks of age for four experimental periods (38, 46, 54 and 62 wks). 3. Eggs obtained from the Fayoumi breed exhibited the highest shell thickness and breaking force. There was a linear improvement in eggshell quality attributes associated with hen's age up to 54 wks, thereafter a deterioration was found for all breeds. 4. Generally, eggs laid by native breeds (Fayoumi and Dandarawi) had better mechanical properties compared to those produced by the commercial strain (Hy-Line Brown). In addition, the interaction between breed and hen's age was not significant for all physical properties and mechanical attributes. There was a highly significant (P≤0.01) positive correlation between the breaking force and either eggshell toughness or shell thickness, and regression analyses suggested that eggshell toughness was the best predictor for breaking force, followed by shell thickness.",Tobacco use and HIV symptom severity in Chinese people living with HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116021,AIDS care,2019 05 22,"Exposure to nicotine among people living with HIV (PLWH) may impact physical health as indicated by experienced symptoms. Yet, the empirical evidence documenting the relations between tobacco use and symptom experiences among PLWH remains limited. This study aims to assess the relationships between tobacco use and HIV symptoms through a cross-sectional survey conducted in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO ASSIST screening test was used for frequency of tobacco use. Sixty-four items from the revised signs and symptoms checklist for persons with HIV disease (SSC-HIVrev) were used. ""Total number of symptoms"" was created by summing all the binary coded and ""Maximal symptom severity"" was created by taking the maximal severity level across all symptoms for each participant. After controlling for confounding variables, tobacco use was not associated with the total number of symptom, yet was associated with the maximal symptom severity. This study documents the link between tobacco use and experienced symptoms among PLWH by demonstrating that higher frequency of tobacco use is associated with greater odds of reporting more severe symptoms. Smoking cessation strategies should be integrated into symptom management interventions for PLWH to optimize their effectiveness.",Episodic memory and executive functioning in informal dementia caregivers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116020,Aging & mental health,2019 05 22,"Objectives: Informal dementia caregivers are thought to experience high levels of depression and burden, which can contribute to worse cognitive functioning. However, poorer cognitive functioning in caregivers is not always found. The current study explored whether caregivers perform better, worse, or similar to non-caregivers on tasks for executive functioning and memory. Whether sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics are associated with caregivers' performance was also assessed. Methods: One hundred forty-five caregivers completed the Letter Fluency and Category Fluency, the Logical Memory test from the WMS-III, and five questionnaires assessing psychological characteristics. Standardized z-scores (based on age, education, and sex) were calculated using data from a matched control group (187 non-caregivers). One sample z-tests were executed to examine if the caregivers' standardized mean z-score significantly deviated from the population mean of z = 0. The z-scores were used as dependent variables in multivariable regression analyses. Results: The caregivers performed significantly better on Logical Memory - Immediate Recall than non-caregivers (z = 2.92, p = .004). The obtained z-scores on the other tasks did not deviate significantly from 0. Male sex and social reliance predicted higher scores on Category Fluency, but the F-test was non-significant, and the explained variance was low (adjusted R2 = .068). Conclusions: We found no evidence for poorer cognitive performance among informal caregivers compared to non-caregivers. Our results suggest that caregiving for a loved one with dementia does not impair the caregivers' episodic memory or executive functioning when measured cross-sectionally.",Anaphylaxis stimulates afferent vagal nerve activity and efferent sympathetic nerve activity in the stomach of anesthetized rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116019,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 05 22,"Systemic anaphylaxis is a life-threatening and allergic reaction that affects various organs. We previously reported that in the stomach, gastric vasoconstriction occurring at the late phase (15-55 min after injection of ovalbumin antigen) was observed in anesthetized rats sensitized with ovalbumin. In addition, anaphylaxis enhances gastric motility and delays emptying. However, the role of extrinsic autonomic nervous system on antigen-induced gastric alterations was not known. Thus, using the same rat anaphylaxis model, we aimed to determine the changes in the efferent and afferent autonomic nerve activities in the stomach during anaphylactic hypotension. The findings showed that injection of ovalbumin antigen cause a substantial systemic hypotension in all sensitized rats. The efferent gastric sympathetic nerve activity (ef-GSNA), but not the efferent vagal nerve activity, increased only at the early phase (1-10 min after injection of ovalbumin antigen) and showed baroreceptor reflex, as evidenced by a stimulatory response to sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension. In general, excitation of ef-GSNA could induce pylorus sphincter contraction and gastric vasoconstriction. In the present study, we found that sympathectomy attenuated anaphylaxis-induced decease in gastric flux, but not increase in gastric vascular resistance. Thus, the increase in ef-GSNA may cause anaphylactic pylorus sphincter contraction, but not anaphylactic gastric vasoconstriction. On the other hand, the afferent gastric vagal nerve activity, but not the afferent sympathetic nerve activity, increased during the early phase of anaphylactic hypotension. However, vagotomy produced no effects on the anaphylactic gastric dysfunction. In conclusion, the gastric sympathetic nerves partly modulate stomach function during systemic anaphylaxis.",Infectious bursal disease virus suppresses H9N2 avian influenza viral shedding in broiler chickens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116018,British poultry science,2019 05 22,"1 Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) causes immunosuppression in chickens, increasing their susceptibility to other infectious diseases and resulting in vaccination failure. Here, we investigated the immune-depressing effect of IBDV on H9N2 avian influenza viral infection in the broiler chickens. 2 For this purpose, chickens were divided into four groups. In group A, chickens were inoculated with IBDV at 21 days of age and H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) 5 days later. Groups B and C only received AIV at 26 days of age and IBDV at 21 days, respectively. The control group (D) were inoculated with normal saline at the same times. Tissue samples from different organs were collected on the days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after H9N2 infection. 3 Macroscopic observation showed IBD lesions in groups A and C, including swollen bursa with the presence of gelatinous exudates, hemorrhages in the thigh muscle, edema, and nephritis. 4 Reverse Transcription-PCR was used to study H9N2 AIV dissemination, and qRT-PCR to determine viral genome copy number in different organs. A considerable titer of AIV was found in the trachea, lungs, cecal tonsils, spleens, and feces of infected chickens. The genome copy number of the virus in the trachea and lungs of group A was significantly higher than that in group B on the first day after inoculation. . But in the other days post inoculation, RT-PCR did not detect the AIV genome in group A. Although there might have been some immunosuppression in group A, IBDV could interfere with AIV replication in the chickens of this group. 5 In conclusion, we propose that pre-exposure to IBDV at 3 weeks of age reduces the replication and shedding of H9N2 in broiler chicken.",Development of an audio and computer cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116017,Aging & mental health,2019 05 22,"Background: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of two novel technology-based interventions for depression in older adults while comparing older adults' preferences for audio-based and computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depressive symptoms. The audio program consisted of eight compact discs and a workbook while the computer program consisted of 11 modules of similar duration provided on a tablet PC. Both interventions consisted of the following topics: 1) introduction, 2) identifying and changing unhelpful thoughts, 3) addressing feelings, 4) relaxation, 5) engaging in pleasant events, 6) assertiveness, and 7) problem-solving. Methods: Fifty-one older adults were recruited from medical settings and rural communities and randomly assigned to an immediate treatment group (computer or audio) with minimal contact or a four-week minimal contact delayed treatment control condition. Results: Participants rated computer-based and audio-based cognitive behavioral therapy fairly equally, with 75% of those who received audio treatment and 85% of those who received computer-based treatment indicating benefits to their mood. Discussion: Computer-based or audio-based cognitive behavioral treatments may be valuable, low-cost modalities to deliver psychotherapy to older adults with depressive symptoms within a health care setting. Both modalities seem to be accepted by older adults.",The effect of routine preoperative interruption of dabigatran therapy on coagulation parameters and dabigatran plasma levels in a mixed surgical population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116016,Anaesthesia and intensive care,2019 06 07,"Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant used for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. While an effective antibody reversal agent is available, its cost precludes routine use and the mainstay of preoperative management is timely dabigatran interruption. Unlike warfarin, there are no universally accepted protocols for interruption of dabigatran in the preoperative period and there is uncertainty around the interpretation of standard coagulation tests in the presence of dabigatran. We performed a prospective, observational pilot study in patients presenting for elective surgery to examine: 1) the preoperative plasma dabigatran concentrations on day of surgery associated with the local dabigatran interruption protocol, 2) the potential utility of dabigatran concentrations on day of surgery, and 3) the utility of standard coagulation tests in determining whether dabigatran concentrations were below a 'safe' threshold for surgery. We recruited patients presenting to pre-admission clinics for elective surgery. Dabigatran concentrations below 30 µg/L were considered adequate for proceeding with surgery. Data were obtained and analysed from 21 patients with a median (range) age of 70 (20-86) years. Median (range) dabigatran concentrations on the day of surgery were 5 (0-59) µg/L. Two patients had day of surgery concentrations exceeding 30 µg/L. Of the standard coagulation tests examined, only the thrombin clotting time (TCT) was abnormal for these two patients. Our interruption protocol was associated with safe dabigatran concentrations in most patients on the day of surgery. A minority of patients had dabigatran concentrations above the safe threshold, which were detectable by abnormal TCT results.",Serratus anterior plane block for upper abdominal incisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116015,Anaesthesia and intensive care,2019 06 07,"Regional anaesthetic techniques for patients undergoing laparotomy have been shown to provide optimal postoperative analgesia and allow early mobilisation, and thus, enhance recovery.

Although there are published cases of this block being used for chest wall analgesia, there are currently no published cases of this block being used for abdominal incisions.

Current implantation methods recommend the radiological method, using standard chest RX in antero-posterior projection, as a method of assessing the correct positioning of the catheter tip. The observational study evaluated the effectiveness in terms of reliability of the intracavitary tip location system (ITLS) method, better known as the ECG method, for the correct positioning of the catheter tip in patients with atrial fibrillation (AFIB); the method exploits the recording of the electrical potential produced by the f waves, expression of the fibrillation of the atrium typical in patients with this disease, the measurement is based on the calculation of the peak-to-peak value of the f waves. They were implanted using this method 101 subjects with previous determination of anthropometric measurement, according to the rule of Peres modified according to Pittiruti, and then subjected to standard thoracic RX in projection antero-posterior and latero-lateral. Our study shows that 97% of the patients implanted with this method at radiological control had the PICC correctly positioned, at an average distance from the hull of 44.9mm; 100% of the patients did not present complications in either the short or medium term. The analysis of the data also shows that the anthropometric evaluations, carried out with the Peres method, corresponded to the correct radiological positioning of the catheter, evaluated with the hull method, only in 45.5% of cases. Our study tends to demonstrate that the ECG-ITLS method, used as a method of intra-procedural control of PICC-type CVC positioning, in patients with atrial fibrillation, has greater reliability than that of anthropometric measurement and equivalent to radiological measurement, but has less chance of incurring in error of reading or projection.",Evaluation of the expression of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (CXCL 12) in psoriatic patients after treatment with Methotrexate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116013,Journal of cosmetic dermatology,2019 05 22,CXCL12 has an important role in skin homeostasis and inflammation.

This retrospective analysis was conducted to identify an appropriate scaling method to predict human PK for ADCs from animal PK data in the linear range. Different methods for projecting human clearance (CL) from animal PK data for 11 ADCs exhibiting linear PK over the tested dose ranges were examined: multiple species allometric scaling (CL vs. body weight), allometric scaling with correction factors, allometric scaling based on rule of exponent, and scaling from only cynomolgus monkey PK data. Two analytes of interest for ADCs, namely total antibody and conjugate (measured as conjugated drug or conjugated antibody), were assessed. Percentage prediction errors (PEs) and residual sum of squares (RSS) were compared across methods. Human CL was best estimated using cynomolgus monkey PK data alone and an allometric scaling exponent of 1.0 for CL. This was consistently observed for both conjugate and total antibody analytes. Other scaling methods either underestimated or overestimated human CL, or produced larger average absolute PEs and RSS. Human concentration-time profiles were also reasonably predicted from the cynomolgus monkey data using species-invariant time method with a fixed exponent of 1.0 for CL and 1.0 for volume of distribution. In conclusion, results from this retrospective analysis of 11 ADCs indicate that allometric scaling of CL with an exponent of 1.0 using cynomolgus monkey PK data alone can successfully project human PK profiles of an ADC within linear range.",Non-infectious granulomatous dermatoses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115996,Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,2019 05 22,"Granulomatous dermatoses comprise a wide range of etiologically and clinically distinct skin diseases that share a common histology characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes include macrophages. While the pathogenesis of these disorders is not fully understood, the underlying mechanism is thought to involve a reaction pattern caused by an immunogenic stimulus. Antigen-presenting cells and the effect of various cytokines play a key role. Our understanding of granulomatous reaction patterns has been advanced by insights drawn from observations of such reactions in patients on immunomodulatory therapy and in individuals with genetic immunodeficiency. Traditionally, a distinction is made between infectious and non-infectious granulomatous dermatoses. The present CME article addresses granulomatous skin diseases for which there is no evidence of a causative infectious agent. Common representatives include granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and cutaneous sarcoidosis. Granulomatous dermatoses may be part of the clinical spectrum of various systemic disorders or may be associated therewith. Some neoplastic disorders may mimic granulomatous dermatoses histologically. Given the pathogenetic diversity involved, the clinical presentation, too, is quite varied. Overall, however, each disorder is characterized by typical clinical features. The diagnosis always requires thorough clinicopathologic correlation.

The need for the optimization of bioprocesses such as ethanol production, to increase product yield, enhanced the development of control strategies. The control system developed by the authors utilized noninvasive Raman measurements to avoid possible sterilization problems. Real-time data analysis was applied using partial least squares regression (PLS) method. With the aid of spectral pretreatment and multivariate data analysis, the monitoring of glucose and ethanol concentration was successful during yeast fermentation with the prediction error of 4.42 g/L for glucose and 2.40 g/L for ethanol. By Raman spectroscopy-based feedback control, the glucose concentration was maintained at 100 g/L by the automatic feeding of concentrated glucose solution. The control of glucose concentration during fed-batch fermentation resulted in increased ethanol production. Ethanol yield of 86% was achieved compared to the batch fermentation when 75% yield was obtained. The results show that the use of Raman spectroscopy for the monitoring and control of yeast fermentation is a promising way to enhance process understanding and achieve consistently high production yield.",miR-145 inhibits glutamine metabolism through c-myc/GLS1 pathways in ovarian cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115975,Cell biology international,2019 06 14,"miR-145 has been found to be a participant in cancer metastasis and glucose metabolism in ovarian cancer. However, the role of glutamine metabolism in ovarian cancer remains unclear. In this study, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of glutamine metabolism by miR-145 in ovarian cancer cells. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of miR-145 and glutaminase 1 (GLS1) were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein levels of c-myc and GLS1 were detected by western blot analysis. Luciferase reporter assays were used to validate c-myc was a target of miR-145. Glutamine metabolism was analyzed using assay kits. In addition, we performed luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to validate c-myc transcription activated GLS1 and promoted GLS1 expression. The qRT-PCR demonstrated that the mRNA level of miR-145 and GLS1 was negatively correlated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test showed that patients with high miR-145 expression had significantly increased the overall survival. The overexpression of miR-145 inhibited glutamine consumption, α-ketoglutarate production, and cellular ATP levels. Furthermore, we found miR-145 inhibited glutamine metabolism by targeting c-myc. Moreover, c-myc could promote GLS1 expression by transcription activated. Together, our results revealed that miR-145 inhibited glutamine metabolism through c-myc/GLS1 pathways in ovarian cancer cells, which may improve the current strategy of ovarian cancer diagnosis and therapy.",Total Syntheses of (+)-Aquatolide and Related Humulanolides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115973,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 22,"The short, efficient total synthesis of (+)-aquatolide was achieved by a biomimetic transannular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which provides the first example of constructing a 5/5/4/8-ring system from asteriscunolides.

These individuals, as well as two additional members of the same family also carrying this KLF1 mutation, exhibit high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). KLF1 is an erythroid transcription factor, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the developmental switch between fetal and adult hemoglobin by regulating the expression of a multitude of genes including that of BCL11A. The mutation appears to be the main candidate responsible for the beta thalassemia-ameliorating effect since this segregates with the observed phenotype and also exogenous expression of the KLF1 mutant protein in human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in the induction of γ-globin, without, however, affecting BCL11A levels. This report adds to the weight of evidence that heterozygous KLF1 mutations can ameliorate the severity of the β-thalassemia major phenotype. This article is protected by copyright.

Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Tafazzin (TAZ) have been recently shown to be involved in osteogenic differentiation. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of AgNps on osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs), and investigate the underlying mechanisms of AgNps activity. MTT assay was employed to determine the safe concentration of AgNps in HPDLFs. Using an alkaline phosphatase assay, Alizarin red S staining and detection of the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN), osterix (OSX), and collagen-I, we found that AgNps, at a concentration range of 25 to 100 μM, promoted osteogenic differentiation of HPDLFs in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that 100 μM AgNps up-regulated the active RhoA expression level. The results of ALP activity and expression of osteogenic markers showed that the effects of AgNps on osteogenic differentiation were abrogated by a RhoA pathway inhibiter, C3 reagent. Additionally, silencing of TAZ attenuated the AgNps-induced osteogenic differentiation of HPDLFs, as shown by decreased ALP activity and down-regulation of osteogenic markers. Interestingly, TAZ knockdown had a very small effect on the activity of RhoA, whereas C3 suppressed the expression of TAZ, indicating that TAZ was a downstream effector of RhoA. In conclusion, the present work demonstrated that AgNps promoted osteogenic differentiation of HPDLFs by activating the RhoA-TAZ axis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Evidence-based treatment guidelines for JOCD are currently lacking. An animal model would facilitate study of JOCD and evaluation of diagnostic and treatment approaches. The purpose of this study was to assess the suitability of miniature pigs as a model of JOCD at the distal femur. First, stifle (knee) joints harvested from three juvenile miniature pigs underwent MRI to establish the vascular architecture of the distal femoral epiphyseal cartilage. Second, vessels supplying the axial or abaxial aspects of the medial femoral condyle were surgically interrupted in four additional juvenile miniature pigs, and the developing epiphyseal cartilage lesions were monitored using three consecutive MRI examinations over nine weeks. The miniature pigs were then euthanized, and their distal femora were harvested for histological evaluation. Vascular architecture of the distal femoral epiphyseal cartilage in the miniature pigs was found to be nearly identical to that of juvenile human subjects, characterized by separate vascular beds supplying the axial and abaxial aspects of the condyles. Surgical interruption of the vascular supply to the abaxial aspect of the medial femoral condyle resulted in ischemic cartilage necrosis (a precursor lesion of JOCD) in 75% (3/4) of the miniature pigs. Cartilage lesions were identified during the first MRI performed 3 weeks post-operatively. No clinically-apparent JOCD-like lesions developed. In conclusion, miniature pigs are suitable for modelling JOCD precursor lesions. Further investigation of the model is warranted to assess induction of clinically-apparent JOCD lesions.

Since adhesion/growth-regulatory galectins are linked to arthritis/osteoarthritis pathogenesis by activating a pro-degradative/-inflammatory gene expression signature, we hypothesized a similar functional involvement of galectins in IVD degeneration. Immunohistochemical evidence for the presence of galectins-1 and -3 in IVD is provided comparatively for specimens of spondylochondrosis, spondylolisthesis and spinal deformity. Immunopositivity was detected in sections of fixed IVD specimens in each cellular compartment with age-, disease- and galectin-type-related differences. Of note, presence of both galectins correlated with IVD degeneration, whereas correlation with age was seen only for Gal-3. In addition, staining profiles for these two galectins showed different distribution patterns in serial sections, an indication for non-redundant functionalities. In vitro, both galectins bound to IVD cells in a glycan-dependent manner. However, exclusively galectin-1 binding triggered a significant induction of functional disease markers (i.e., IL6, CXCL8 and MMP1/3/13) with involvement of the NF-kB pathway. This study thus gives direction to further network analyses and functional studies on galectins in IVD degeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

The VDR has also been identified in muscle cells. Vit D supplementation resulted in improved muscle strength. However, there is a paucity of studies of the role of Vit D on tenocytes. We investigated the effects of Vit D on damaged tenocytes. Human tenocytes were treated with dexamethasone (Dex) to induce cell injury. Expression of the tenocyte-related markers tenomodulin (Tnmd), tenascin C (Tnc), scleraxis (Scx), mohawk (Mkx), and collagen (Col) 1 and 3 were measured. Then, tenocytes were cotreated with Vit D. 1-α-Hydroxylase and VDR were explored in tenocytes. With 10 μM Dex, the growth of tenocytes was significantly inhibited, and the gene expression of Tnmd, Tnc, Scx, Mkx, Col 1 and 3 also decreased. When tenocytes were cotreated with Vit D, cell proliferation recovered in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression of TNMD and Col 1 improved. When studying the mechanisms of the effects of Vit D on tenocytes, reactive oxygen species produced by Dex decreased with Vit D, and the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was stimulated by Vit D cotreatment. 1-α-Hydroxylase and VDR were found in tenocytes, indicating that the cells have the ability to use an inactive form of Vit D and interact with it. Vit D is known to perform diverse actions and its protective effects on tenocytes suggest its beneficial role in tendon in addition to muscle and bone. This article is protected by copyright.

Freeze-thawed menisci are used in clinical practice to replace defective menisci; however, the disadvantages of freeze-thawed tissues include disease transmission and immune rejection. In this study, we decellularized menisci using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and compared the decellularized menisci with freeze-thawed menisci. Porcine menisci were either pressurized at 1,000 MPa for 10 min and then washed with DNase solution or frozen at -80 °C for two days and thawed. These menisci then underwent in vitro histological, biochemical, and biomechanical comparisons with native menisci. The HHP-treated and freeze-thawed menisci were also subcutaneously implanted in a pig, and later harvested for histological analysis. The numbers of histologically detected cells were significantly lower and the amount of biochemically detected DNA was approximately 100-fold lower in HHP-treated than in native and freeze-thawed menisci. The compression strength of the HHP-decellularized menisci was decreased after 1 and 50 cycles at 20% strain but was unchanged in the freeze-thawed menisci. After implantation, the numbers of multinucleated giant cells were significantly lower around the HHP-treated menisci than around the freeze-thawed menisci. Recellularization of the HHP-decellularized menisci was confirmed. Thus, although the HHP-decellularized menisci were mechanically inferior to the freeze-thawed meniscus in vitro, they were immunologically superior. Our study is the first to demonstrate the use of HHP for decellularization of the meniscus. This article is protected by copyright.

However, its use is restricted due to the inability to obtain sufficiently long veins for larger grafts. We previously reported that vein-derived basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which reduces allodynia via its anti-inflammatory properties. To mimic vein wrapping, we developed a collagen sheet impregnated with bFGF. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) was induced in male Wistar rats as a model of sciatic nerve injury, and the rats were divided into three groups: (1) untreated after CCI surgery (control group), (2) treated with a collagen sheet wrap impregnated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS/CS group), and (3) treated with a collagen sheet wrap impregnated with bFGF (bFGF/CS group). Pain behavior (von Frey test) was evaluated on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 5, 7, and 14. Quantitative PCR was conducted on sciatic nerve RNA to quantify HO-1 gene, Hmox1, expression. ELISA were used to determine HO-1 protein levels on POD 1. von Frey testing showed significantly greater pain hypersensitivity in the control and PBS/CS groups than the bFGF/CS group. In the bFGF/CS group, Hmox1 mRNA and HO-1 protein levels were significantly increased in the sciatic nerve compared to the control and PBS/CS groups on PODs 1 and 5 and POD 1, respectively. The bFGF/CS group showed decreased allodynia and HO-1 induction, as observed with vein wrapping. Therefore, local application of bFGF may be an alternative treatment strategy for compressive neuropathy and peripheral nerve trauma in clinical settings. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of nivolumab monotherapy in Chinese patients with previously treated advanced/recurrent solid tumors, including NSCLC and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), using data from 2 predominantly Chinese (CheckMate 077 and 078), and 5 global (MDX1106-01, CA209-003, and CheckMate 017, 057, and 063) studies. The PPK model was developed by reestimating parameters of a prior global population model with Chinese patient data. Model reestimates showed nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) to be linear and dose proportional. Race did not have a clinically meaningful effect on nivolumab clearance. Body weight, Asian race, sex, and performance status had significant effects on clearance. Baseline clearance was 9% lower in the Asian versus the global population but not considered clinically relevant. Change in time-varying clearance and predicted nivolumab exposures with 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) were similar in Chinese, non-Chinese Asian, and non-Asian patients. In Chinese patients, the predicted nivolumab exposure with a 240-mg Q2W regimen was ∼25% higher than with 3 mg/kg Q2W, but ∼62% lower than that of a previously evaluated, well-tolerated regimen of 10 mg/kg Q2W (global population). Differences in nivolumab baseline clearance and exposures between patients with NPC and NSCLC were not clinically meaningful (<20%).

This study was undertaken to identify the causes of district-wide basement infiltration in an aquitard system. It comprised widespread continuous monitoring of utility trench wells and dye tracing from storm sewer system exfiltration tests. The results indicate that a major effect of urbanization on shallow groundwater is related to storm sewer system exfiltration, which is marked by a characteristic pattern of head variations in the aquitard unrelated to distributed surface infiltration. The aquitard constrains flow from storm sewer system exfiltration to the utility trench, creating an urban flow path for groundwater discharge. Temporary build-up of water levels in the utility trench drives relatively high-velocity flow through the permeable sewer bedding material of the utility trench to a separate foundation drainage collector system, ultimately causing a severe 'urban karst' effect that produces system surcharging and widespread basement water infiltration. The main conditions causing the 'urban karst' are the large hydraulic conductivity ratio between the utility trench material and the aquitard and the shallow depth and low gradient of the storm sewer system imposed by a very flat drainage basin.

The present study proposed a clinically relevant animal model that satisfied: i) induction of osteoporosis, ii) unilateral complete osteotomy at metaphysis, iii) internal fixation. 6 months old female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 64) were randomly divided into the ovariectomised-metaphyseal osteotomy (OVX, n = 32) and metaphyseal osteotomy (SHAM, n = 32) groups. The metaphyseal-osteotomy model was created with a plate-fixation of the osteotomy and assessed by X-ray, micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and mechanical testing at weeks 1, 3 and 6. X-ray results showed complete healing of metaphyseal osteotomy at week 6. Histology showed 3 stages of metaphyseal healing. Stage 1 was characterised by fibrous tissue, consisting of disorganised orientation of collagen fibres, and infiltration of immune cells. At stage 2, a transitional zone consisting of maturing fibrous tissue and differentiating mesenchymal cells with early trabecular bone formation and disorganised woven bone were observed. During stage 3, cortical bone ends unified and woven bone underwent transformation to lamellar bone. OVX group healing was significantly delayed when compared to SHAM samples. The study demonstrated that healing of osteoporotic osteotomy at the metaphyseal region was delayed in terms of radiography, histomorphometry and mechanical strength. These quantitative evaluations, along with histological features, may provide key references for future studies. The animal model may provide additional clinical relevance as most osteoporotic fracture in humans occurs at metaphyseal regions.",Budget Impact Analysis of Molecular Lymph Node Staging Versus Conventional Histopathology Staging in Colorectal Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115896,Applied health economics and health policy,2019 05 22,"The presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis is a critical prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and is also an indicator for adjuvant chemotherapy.

Overall, 130 patients who received at least two cycles of standard chemoimmunotherapy were evaluated; of these, 64 patients received additional systemic HD-MTX, either on day 15 of alternating cycles or 2-5 weeks after completion of primary therapy. Patients receiving HD-MTX showed a generally higher risk of CNS relapse than the other 66 patients not receiving prophylaxis. The estimated 2-year cumulative CNS relapse, progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 8.1%, 66.3%, and 77.5%, respectively, in patients who received systemic HD-MTX and 6.9%, 67.4%, and 71.4%, respectively, in patients without prophylaxis, with no significant between-group differences.

In the present study, we studied the expression of CD48 in a total of 74 primary MM samples derived from patients to evaluate SLAMF2 (CD48) as a candidate in mAb therapy for MM. Of 74 samples, 39 were subjected to SLAMF7 analysis. Most of the MM cells, defined as CD38 and CD138 double-positive cells, showed strong expression of CD48 or SLAMF7 independent of disease stage or treatment history. In these 39 samples, most MM cells showed expression of both SLAMF7 and CD48; however, several samples showed expression of either only CD48 or only SLAMF7, including seven cases that were only highly positive for SLAMF7, and five that were only highly positive for CD48. Our study demonstrates that the immune receptor CD48 is overexpressed on MM cells together with SLAMF7, and that CD48 may be considered as an alternative target for treatment of MM in cases showing weak expression of SLAMF7.",Application of GFR estimation equations in elderly patients with measured GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115878,Aging clinical and experimental research,2019 05 22,"Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations can be inaccurate when applied to elderly patients.

In addition, ageing has been associated with higher levels of different inflammatory biomarkers while the association between inflammatory biomarkers and PA has remained controversial. The aim of the current investigation was to examine the association between blood biomarkers and objectively assessed PA among a sample of healthy older women with different levels of PA engagement. A total of 81 healthy women were recruited. Study participants were allocated to three groups according to accelerometer-obtained PA data. Body composition was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting blood samples were collected for the measurement of resistin, leptin, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. There were no significant differences between groups for resistin, leptin, TNFα and for CRP concentrations; however, higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) groups tended to have lower level of blood biomarker concentrations. There was a significant negative relationship between resistin and steps per day. Inverse association between leptin and MVPA was significant after controlling for age. In multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis, steps per day were the strongest independent predictor for resistin, whereas for leptin, TNFα and CRP the strongest independent predictor was whole body fat mass. In conclusion, this study demonstrated negative association between resistin concentration and steps per day.

In one of the areas most affected by nitrates, the Lombardy Plain (Italy), the effectiveness of the ND and the capacity of governance to support its application correctly was assessed using a socio-hydrogeological approach. Nitrate trends over 11 years show that most regions present steady or increasing concentrations, highlighting how contamination can affect previously impaired situations and supposedly resistant and resilient aquifers. Stakeholder network analysis reveals that the governance framework does not support knowledge dissemination and changes in farmers' attitudes, hindering water quality improvements. Nitrogen input needs to be reduced and manure relocation monitored. The local governance scale has a key role in enhancing ND dissemination. Reports to the EU Commission should integrate multi- or interdisciplinary evaluation of trends, including governance dynamics, alongside hydrochemical information."

The model accounts for known anatomy and physiology of the brain, including the presence of distinct blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. CSF and interstitial fluid turnover, and FcRn mediated transport of mAbs are accounted for. The model was first used to characterize published and in-house pharmacokinetic (PK) data on the disposition of mAbs in rat brain, including the data on PK of mAb in different regions of brain determined using microdialysis. Majority of model parameters were fixed based on literature reported values, and only 3 parameters were estimated using rat data. The rat PBPK model was translated to mouse, monkey, and human, simply by changing the values of physiological parameters corresponding to each species. The translated PBPK models were validated by a priori predicting brain PK of mAbs in all three species, and comparing predicted exposures with observed data. The platform PBPK model was able to a priori predict all the validation PK profiles reasonably well (within threefold), without estimating any parameters. As such, the platform PBPK model presented here provides an unprecedented quantitative tool for prediction of mAb PK at the site-of-action in the brain, and preclinical-to-clinical translation of mAbs being developed against central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The proposed model can be further expanded to account for target engagement, disease pathophysiology, and novel mechanisms, to support discovery and development of novel CNS targeting mAbs.",Routine clinical care data for population pharmacokinetic modeling: the case for Fanhdi/Alphanate in hemophilia A patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115857,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,2019 05 22,"Fanhdi/Alphanate is a plasma derived factor VIII concentrate used for treating hemophilia A, for which there has not been any dedicated model describing its pharmacokinetics (PK). A population PK model was developed using data extracted from the Web-Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service-Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo) project. WAPPS-Hemo provided individual PK profiles for hemophilia patients using sparse observations as provided in routine clinical care by hemophilia centers. Plasma factor activity measurements and covariate data from hemophilia A patients on Fanhdi/Alphanate were extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database. A population PK model was developed using NONMEM and evaluated for suitability for Bayesian forecasting using prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC), cross validation, limited sampling analysis and external evaluation against a population PK model developed on rich sampling data. Plasma factor activity measurements from 92 patients from 12 centers were used to derive the model. The PK was best described by a 2-compartment model including between subject variability on clearance and central volume, fat free mass as a covariate on clearance, central and peripheral volumes, and age as covariate on clearance. Evaluations showed that the developed population PK model could predict the PK parameters of new individuals based on limited sampling analysis and cross and external evaluations with acceptable precision and bias. This study shows the feasibility of using real-world data for the development of a population PK model. Evaluation and comparison of the model for Bayesian forecasting resulted in similar results as a model developed using rich sampling data.",Distribution pattern of FDG uptake using ring-type dedicated breast PET in comparison to whole-body PET/CT scanning in invasive breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115856,Annals of nuclear medicine,2019 05 22,This study aimed to investigate the incidence of rim uptake (RU) or multifocal uptake (MU) by invasive breast cancers on a ring-type dedicated breast positron emission tomography (dbPET) scanner compared with whole-body PET (wbPET) scanner imaging and to correlate uptake patterns with pathological features and prognosis.,Papillary Thyroid Cancers with Focal Tall Cell Change are as Aggressive as Tall Cell Variants and Should Not be Considered as Low-Risk Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115855,Annals of surgical oncology,2019 05 22,The tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is as an aggressive histological variant.

Since various synthetic modifications have been widely applied to these nanoparticles for better targeting behaviors, it is meaningful to apply the optimal magnetic field condition for each case. This will enable creating a safe and efficient drug targeting using different types of MPs. In the present study, we aimed to find out any changes of transepithelial transport of polysaccharide-coated MPs by applying the continuous or the pulsatile magnetic field condition. Our results with heparin-functionalized MPs indicate that the particle concentrations and the external magnetic field could influence the transepithelial permeability of the particles. In the presence of a continuously applied magnetic density, heparin-MPs at high concentrations, by forming magnetically-induced aggregation of particles over the cell surface layer, showed a lower cellular transport than those at low concentrations. Furthermore, the results from the quantitative chemical assays and imaging analyses showed that transepithelial transport of heparin-MPs (negatively charged) under the pulsatile magnetic field was higher than that under the continuous magnetic field (CP), whereas the starch-MPs (neutrally charged) showed a small difference in transepithelial transport or cell retention between pulsatile vs. continuous magnetic field conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that the external magnetic field should be differentially applied to control the cellular drug transport depending on the physicochemical properties of the surface chemistry of magnetic particles.","The hierarchically mechanistic mind: an evolutionary systems theory of the human brain, cognition, and behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115833,"Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",2019 05 22,"The purpose of this review was to integrate leading paradigms in psychology and neuroscience with a theory of the embodied, situated human brain, called the Hierarchically Mechanistic Mind (HMM). The HMM describes the brain as a complex adaptive system that functions to minimize the entropy of our sensory and physical states via action-perception cycles generated by hierarchical neural dynamics. First, we review the extant literature on the hierarchical structure of the brain. Next, we derive the HMM from a broader evolutionary systems theory that explains neural structure and function in terms of dynamic interactions across four nested levels of biological causation (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism). We then describe how the HMM aligns with a global brain theory in neuroscience called the free-energy principle, leveraging this theory to mathematically formulate neural dynamics across hierarchical spatiotemporal scales. We conclude by exploring the implications of the HMM for psychological inquiry.",Medico-Religious Plants Employed in Mauritius: A Survey Among Hindu Priests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115832,Journal of religion and health,2019 05 22,"Mauritius is renowned for its rich floral and cultural diversity.

Neutrophil migration was evaluated by measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO) kinetic-colorimetric assay and the cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intramuscular or intrathecal pretreatment with A-317491 prevented static contraction-induced mechanical muscle hyperalgesia. In addition, A-317491 reduced static contraction-induced mechanical muscle hyperalgesia when administered 30 and 60 min of the beginning of static contraction, but not after 30 and 60 min of the end of static contraction. Intramuscular A-317491 also prevented static contraction-induced neutrophil migration. In a period of 24 h, static contraction did not increase muscle levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. These findings demonstrated that mechanical muscle hyperalgesia and neutrophil migration induced by static contraction are modulated by P2X3 receptors expressed on the gastrocnemius muscle and spinal cord dorsal horn. Also, we suggest that P2X3 receptors are important to the development but not to maintenance of muscle hyperalgesia. Therefore, P2X3 receptors can be pointed out as a target to musculoskeletal pain conditions induced by daily or work-related activities.",Using the surgical guide for impression-free digital bite registration in the edentulous maxilla-a technical note.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115829,International journal of implant dentistry,2019 06 10,"Studies reporting on the application of digital bite registration for fully edentulous patients rehabilitated with dental implants are scarce. This article describes a technique for intraoral digital registration of the occlusal vertical dimension in a fully edentulous maxilla to be rehabilitated with a fixed implant prosthesis. Following fully guided placement of six maxillary implants, the surgical stent duplicating the existing upper full denture was securely fixed on two anterior implants and sectioned along the center line of the hard palate. An intraoral scanner was used for the digital impression of the maxilla and dentate mandible. The occlusal vertical dimension was registered on each side using the contralateral part of the surgical guide along with the scanbodies on each side. The procedure allowed for the precise digital mounting of the digitized jaws. The maxilla was restored with a full-arch implant-supported prosthesis.",Disquieting Experiences of Ruptures in the Life Trajectory: Challenges to Dynamic Self-Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115828,Integrative psychological & behavioral science,2019 05 22,"This paper aims to deepen the understanding on how people face experiences of significant ruptures in their life trajectories, in articulation with and in the light of the notion of disquieting experience. Since the semiotic-cultural constructivist perspective in psychology, the empirical corpus that will be taken for analysis, based on this circumstantial nature experience, refers to women's narratives whose life trajectories were marked by repeated gestational losses. The experience of a gestational loss can be perceived and felt by a woman as an unexpected event, which challenges personal and socio-cultural expectations of what was about to happen - becoming a mother and the birth of a baby. Gaps established between the imagined expectations and perceived reality, produce a non-sense field, experienced by the person as disquieting. In order to reduce the experienced psychological tension and integrate non-sense field in cognitive-affective base pre-existing, new symbolic actions are required to subject in the construction of reorganizers meanings from personal experience - what we denominate semiotic strategies of dynamic self-repair. With this, this paper aimed to shed light on the dynamic and complex aspects of human life related to the psychological processes involved in self repair, due to disruptive events.",Effects of Workplace-Based Physical Activity Interventions on Cardiorespiratory Fitness: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115827,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 05 22,Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality.

The present study evaluated the occurrence, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of V. parahaemolyticus in seawater and bivalves obtained in 2016 from the southern coast of Korea, an important region for commercial aquaculture industries, especially the Korean raw seafood culture. V. parahaemolyticus was detected in 87 of 160 (54.4%) bivalve samples and in 32 of 130 (24.5%) seawater samples. Especially high levels were detected during summer to early autumn. All the seawater and bivalves contained less than 2 and 5% of the tdh and trh genes of the isolates, respectively, and seawater isolates possessed two fewer genes than the bivalve isolates. Of 23 antimicrobials tested, three agents (ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) effectively treated V. parahaemolyticus illness due to the sensitivity of the isolates. The isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin, however, excluding it as a treatment option. More than half of the isolates exhibited resistance to at least three antimicrobials. These findings indicate the importance of an integrated monitoring and surveillance program noting the occurrence, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of V. parahaemolyticus in various aquatic sources for preventing human health risks from seafood consumption.",Study on the microbial community in earthworm and soil under cadmium stress based on contour line analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115813,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"Cadmium (Cd) contamination in soil has become the focus of widespread concern in society today. In this paper, with Eisenia fetida as research subjects, an indoor simulation experiment was conducted. A BIOLOG microplate technique was used to determine the carbon source (single-carbon) utilization of the microbial communities in the contaminated soil and earthworms under Cd stress. Contour line analysis was used for the first time to study the difference of carbon source metabolism in microbial communities. And the effects of Cd stress on the functional diversity of the microbial communities and the detoxification mechanism in earthworms were researched. With two test groups, a short-term test and the long-term test were performed. The former test lasted for 10 days, with the removal of an earthworm every day for analysis; the latter test lasted for 30 days, with the removal of an earthworm every 10 days. The Cd2+ concentration was set at 0, 50, 100, 125, 250, or 500 mg kg-1 dry weight, and 10 earthworms were inoculated in each concentration treatment. The earthworm homogenate and soil extracts were used to determine the carbon source utilization of the microbial communities. The results show that Cd stress changed the functional diversity of the microbial communities in the soil and earthworms. With the extension of stress time and the increase of stress concentration, earthworms will adjust their own physiological functions (including the microbial community structure and stress mechanism in the body) and regulate the microbial community structure in the external environment to obtain the necessary substances for growth. In addition, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, γ-hydroxybutyric acid, glutamyl-L-glutamic acid, α-butyric acid, threonine, and α-cyclodextrin were important carbon sources for the earthworms to maintain their normal physiological metabolism under Cd stress. This study confirms that changes in microbial communities can be used to reveal the detoxification mechanisms of earthworm under heavy metal stress.",Photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and isopropanol by LaFeO3/black-TiO2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115812,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"Large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted from industrial, mobile, and domestic sources, causing adverse effects on human health and environment. Among VOCs, toluene and isopropanol (IPA) are commonly used as solvent, soldering flux, and spray paint and their emissions need to be reduced. Several VOCs abatement technologies are available to reduce VOC emission and photocatalytic oxidation of VOC is regarded as a viable technique due to its advantage of utilizing solar energy. TiO2 has been investigated for its oxidation capability toward VOCs because of its good photocatalytic activity. However the utilization is limited to UV due to its wider bandgap; furthermore, its fast recombination rate of electron-hole pair reduces the oxidation rate of VOCs. Black-TiO2 and perovskite-type photocatalyst such as LaFeO3 can be applied to enhance photocatalytic activity due to narrower bandgap and longer electron-hole pair lifetime. In this study, black-TiO2 and LaFeO3 are prepared and investigated for their photocatalytic oxidation rates toward toluene and IPA. Results show that toluene removals achieved with black-TiO2 and LaFeO3 are 89% and 98% while IPA removals are 90% and 94%, respectively. Both photocatalysts show better photocatalytic activity than TiO2 and good absorption capability toward visible light. Graphical abstract.",Enhanced effects of ash and slag on SO3 formation in the post-flame region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115811,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"The effects of slag, fly ash (formed in boiler above 1500 °C), and experimental ash (formed in muffle furnace at 815 °C) on the formation of sulfur trioxide (SO3) were studied in a fixed bed rector. The results showed that the slag had the best catalytic effect on SO3 formation, the effect of fly ash was second, and the effect of experimental ash was the worst. The reason may be that the forms of iron in different samples were different. Iron in the experimental ash all existed in the form of Fe2O3. Iron in the fly ash mainly existed in the form of composite iron oxides, such as Fe0.3Mg0.7SiO3, Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3, and MgFe2O4. Iron in the slag also mainly existed in the form of composite iron oxides, such as CaFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and CaMgO0.88Fe0.12SiO4. The different forms of iron had different effects on SO3 formation. Composite iron oxides could produce more oxygen vacancies owing to lattice defects. This likely promoted the migration and regeneration of lattice oxygen and thus better promoted the formation of SO3 than Fe2O3. Moreover, MgFe2O4 and Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3 could better promote SO3 formation than CaMgO0.88Fe0.12SiO4 and Fe0.3Mg0.7SiO3. In addition, increasing the SO2 concentration and O2 concentration increased the SO3 concentration but increasing the SO2 concentration decreased the SO3 formation ratio.",Use of soil amendments to reduce cadmium accumulation in rice by changing Cd distribution in soil aggregates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115810,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the response of cadmium (Cd) distribution and stability in soil aggregates as affected by applying different amendments and to understand the relationship between changes in soil aggregates and alleviation of Cd phytotoxicity to rice after amendment application. In the present study, rice (Oryza sativa L.) was cultivated on a Cd-polluted soil. Five soil amendments were applied, which are as follows: rice husk biochar (BC), Fe-added rice husk biochar (Fe-BC), attapulgite-based mixture (AM), zeolite-based mixture (ZM), and cow manure-based mixture (MM). The effect on Cd redistribution in soil and Cd accumulation in rice plant was evaluated. The results showed that the five amendments applied at the rate of 3% (w/w) significantly increased soil pH and decreased Cd mobility in soil and Cd accumulation in rice plants. The reduction rate of Cd content in rice grains ranged from 41 to 62% after amendment application. The remediation efficiency of the different amendments for decreasing Cd accumulation in rice tissues followed the order of Fe-BC > MM > BC > ZM > AM. Adding amendments promoted the formation of large aggregates (0.2-2.0 mm) with more mass loading of Cd and enhanced aggregate stability. Comparatively, Fe-BC was more effective than others for remediation of acid Cd-polluted paddy soil, as a significantly decreased Cd concentration in rice grain after its application was observed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that DTPA-extractable Cd in small aggregates was the main factor affecting Cd accumulation in rice grain; soil pH directly affected aggregate stability; and aggregate stability was closely related to Cd availability in different size soil particles. These results indicated that the applied amendments were effective in reducing Cd bioavailability, most likely through raising the soil pH, improving aggregate stability, and re-distributing Cd from smaller soil aggregates to larger ones.","Comparison of monoculture and mixed culture (Scenedesmus obliquus and wild algae) for C, N, and P removal and lipid production.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115809,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"This study compared the efficiency of nutrient removal and lipid accumulation by a monoculture of Scenedesmus obliquus and mixed cultures of microalgae. The highest removal efficiencies of ammonium (99.2%), phosphate (91.2%), and total organic carbon (83.6%) occurred in the monoculture. All the mixed cultures were dominated by S. quadricauda; in some mixed cultures, the proportions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and C. microsphaera reached > 20%. The lipid content and lipid production in the monoculture were 15.9% and 52.3 mg kg-1, respectively, significantly higher than those in all the mixed cultures of microalgae. In all the mixed cultures, the proportion of palmitic acid was > 50%.

In the last few decades, butanol, as liquid biofuel, has received considerable research attention due to its advantages over ethanol. Several studies have focused on the production of butanol through the fermentation from raw renewable biomass, such as lignocellulosic materials. However, the low concentration and productivity of butanol production and the price of raw materials are limitations for butanol fermentation. Moreover, these limitations are the main causes of industrial decline in butanol production. This study reviews butanol fermentation, including the metabolism and characteristics of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) producing clostridia. Furthermore, types of butanol production from biomass feedstock are detailed in this study. Specifically, this study introduces the recent progress on the efficient butanol production of ""designed"" and modified biomass. Additionally, the recent advances in the butanol fermentation process, such as multistage continuous fermentation, metabolic flow change of the electron carrier supplement, continuous fermentation with immobilization and recycling of cell, and the recent technical separation of the products from the fermentation broth, are described in this study.",The impact of natural gas and renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions and economic growth in two major emerging market economies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115807,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"For the last three decades, both China and India are considered as the largest emerging market economies in the world. Both of these economies play an essential role in the global economy in terms of economic output and CO2 emissions. Hence, these countries are expected to play an important role in setting up environmental and sustainable development policies. Therefore, our paper aims to examine the role of natural gas and renewable energy consumptions on CO2 emissions and economic growth during 1965-2016 within a multivariate framework. The autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach to cointegration and vector error correction model (VECM) is employed to explore the long-run and causal nexus among the natural gas consumption, renewable energy consumption, coal and petroleum consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic growth, respectively. The empirical results show existence of long-run equilibrium association among the variables. The Granger causality results indicate that the short-run bidirectional causality between renewable energy consumption and economic growth in India, while no causality is found between these two variables in China. However, natural gas consumption causes economic growth in China whereas no causality is confirmed in India in the short-run. The findings further suggest that there is long-run bidirectional causality among the considered variables in both countries. Our paper addresses several important policy implications.",Cellular distribution of cadmium in two amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) cultivars differing in cadmium accumulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115806,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"Differences in cellular cadmium (Cd) distribution between Cd-tolerant and Cd-sensitive lines of amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) may reveal mechanisms involved in Cd tolerance and hyperaccumulation. We compared the cellular distribution and accumulation of Cd in roots, stems, and leaves between a low-Cd accumulating cultivar (Zibeixian, L-Cd) and a high-Cd accumulating cultivar (Tianxingmi, H-Cd) in a hydroponic experimental system. In all treatments, H-Cd grew better than L-Cd and accumulated more Cd. As the Cd concentration increased, the H-Cd plants grew normally and their biomass increased, except in the 60 μM Cd treatment. The biomass of L-Cd decreased with increasing Cd concentrations. The highest Cd concentration in the roots, stems, and leaves of H-Cd was 950 mg/kg, 305 mg/kg, and 205 mg/kg, respectively, compared with 269 mg/kg, 62.9 mg/kg, and 74.8 mg/kg, respectively, in L-Cd. The Cd distribution differed between the two cultivars. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry analyses showed that Cd was distributed across the entire cross section of H-Cd roots but largely restricted to the epidermal cells and the exodermis of L-Cd roots. The main Cd storage sites were the root apoplast, cell walls, and intercellular spaces in H-Cd and the root epidermal cells and the exodermis in L-Cd. In H-Cd leaves, Cd accumulated mainly in vacuoles of epidermal cells and, at high external Cd concentrations, in the vacuoles of mesophyll cells.","Evaluation of genetic damage in pesticides applicators from the province of Córdoba, Argentina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115805,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 22,"The impact evaluation of pesticide exposure is conducted using combined data from biomonitoring and environmental monitoring. Damage to the human genome is, probably, the leading cause of chronic-degenerative disorders, reproductive toxicology, and developmental problems. Although the general population is exposed to pesticides, workers in the agrochemical industry and farmers represent a high-risk group due to the occupational and environmental exposure. The aim of this study is to determine whether occupational exposure to agrochemicals in Córdoba (Argentina) constitute a factor of genotoxic damage. The study was conducted in 30 pesticide applicators from the province of Córdoba. Chromosomal aberrations (CAs), micronuclei (MN), and comet assays (CO) were performed. The current study shows that occupational exposure to pesticides increases values of CAs, MN, and DNA fragmentation biomarkers, all indicators of damage to the genetic material. Evidence suggests that chronic exposure to pesticides is a potential risk to workers health."

The ability to manage play-fighting interactions can favour the development of communicative modules and their correct decoding. Due to their high levels of social cohesion and cooperation, slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) are a very good model to test some hypotheses on the role of facial communication in synchronizing playful motor actions. We found that the relaxed open mouth (ROM), a playful facial expression conveying a positive mood in several social mammals, is also present in meerkats. ROM was mainly perceived during dyadic playful sessions compared to polyadic ones. We also found that meerkats mimic in a very rapid and automatic way the ROM emitted by playmates (Rapid Facial Mimicry, RFM). RFM was positively correlated with the relationship quality shared by subjects, thus suggesting that the mimicry phenomenon is socially modulated. Moreover, more than the mere presence of isolated ROMs, the presence of at RFM prolonged the duration of the play session. Through RFM animals can share the emotional mood, they are experiencing and this appears to be particularly adaptive in those species, whose relationships are not inhibited by rank rules and when animals build and maintain their bonds through social affiliation. The meerkat society is cohesive and cooperative. Such features could have, therefore, favoured the evolution of facial mimicry, a phenomenon linked to emotional contagion, one of the most basic forms of empathy.",Inhibition of p53 and/or AKT as a new therapeutic approach specifically targeting ALT cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115790,Protein & cell,2019 06 13,"While the majority of all human cancers counteract telomere shortening by expressing telomerase, ~15% of all cancers maintain telomere length by a telomerase-independent mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Here, we show that high load of intrinsic DNA damage is present in ALT cancer cells, leading to apoptosis stress by activating p53-independent, but JNK/c-Myc-dependent apoptotic pathway. Notably, ALT cells expressing wild-type p53 show much lower apoptosis than p53-deficient ALT cells. Mechanistically, we find that intrinsic DNA damage in ALT cells induces low level of p53 that is insufficient to initiate the transcription of apoptosis-related genes, but is sufficient to stimulate the expression of key components of mTORC2 (mTOR and Rictor), which in turn leads to phosphorylation of AKT. Activated AKT (p-AKT) thereby stimulates downstream anti-apoptotic events. Therefore, p53 and AKT are the key factors that suppress spontaneous apoptosis in ALT cells. Indeed, inhibition of p53 or AKT selectively induces rapid death of ALT cells in vitro, and p53 inhibitor severely suppresses the growth of ALT-cell xenograft tumors in mice. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of p53 in anti-apoptosis and identify that the inhibition of p53 or AKT has a potential as therapeutics for specifically targeting ALT cancers.","The seroprevalence of Bartonella spp. in the blood of patients with musculoskeletal complaints and blood donors, Poland: a pilot study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115789,Clinical rheumatology,2019 05 22,"Bartonella spp. can cause a variety of diseases, such as lymphadenopathies, cat scratch disease, and trench fever, but can also give rise to many non-specific symptoms.

Considering the muscle weakness resulting from disease activity as well as from the administered drugs, these patients could benefit from an evidence-based physical therapy program. To perform a systematic review to assess safety and effects of physical therapy on the functional outcome of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in both active and quiescent disease: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane. Patients with one of the following idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and/or overlap myositis. The intervention included several types of rehabilitation programs, from strength and resistance training to endurance training, with a minimal duration of 1 month. Studies reporting intervention-related adverse events, disease activity, and functional outcomes were eligible. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane guidelines. We included five randomized controlled and seven open-label non-randomized non-controlled trials. Data on statistical significance were extracted for all the trials. Included trials were of medium-quality evidence given the low number of patients and some risk of bias factors. Physical therapy does not have a negative effect on the disease activity of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in quiescent disease and could improve functional outcome. The physical therapy program should minimally include endurance training. A combination with resistance training might be beneficial.",White matter changes follow low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation plus intensive occupational therapy for motor paralysis after stroke: a DTI study using TBSS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115787,Acta neurologica Belgica,2019 05 22,"Intervention that combines low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and intensive occupational therapy (OT) may improve brain function in post-stroke patients with motor paralysis. We aimed to clarify the brain region involved in motor function improvement following chronic stroke. We recruited 25 patients hospitalized for 15 days with post-stroke upper extremity paralysis to receive 12 sessions of low-frequency rTMS over the non-lesioned hemisphere and occupational therapy. In this study, 72% of the patients had suffered from intracranial haemorrhage. Imaging analysis was performed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess changes in white matter after intervention. We investigated white matter change before and after intervention and the relationship between white matter structure and motor function recovery using tract-based spatial statistics. The intra-voxel directional coherence was significantly increased in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and anterior thalamic radiation on the lesional side following intervention. Mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity values of clusters in the superior corona radiata on the lesional side were negatively correlated with motor function recovery. White matter nerve fibre structures are involved in motor function improvement following rTMS and OT interventions.

Four environmental exposure conditions were considered: high vacuum (HV), O2, N2, and air. The devices exposed to O2 and N2 for 2 h performed in a manner similar to that of the device kept in HV. However, the device exposed to air for 2 h exhibited significantly better electrical properties than its counterparts. The average and highest carrier mobility of the 70 air-exposed C8-BTBT TFTs were 4.82 and 8.07 cm2V-1s-1, respectively. This can be compared to 2.76 cm2V-1s-1 and 4.70 cm2V-1s-1, respectively, for the 70 devices kept in HV. Furthermore, device air stability was investigated. The electrical performance of C8-BTBT TFTs degrades after long periods of air exposure. Our work improves knowledge of charge transport behavior and mechanisms in C8-BTBT OTFTs. It also provides ideas that may help to improve device electrical performance further.",Profiles of Future Orientation among Assault-injured Adolescents: Correlates and Concurrent Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115785,Journal of youth and adolescence,2019 05 22,"Future orientation has been established as having positive associations with health and educational outcomes for adolescents exposed to violence. However, conceptualizations of future orientation have been inconsistent. This study uses latent profile analysis to understand the interrelationships between measures of future orientation (e.g., commitment to learning, goal orientation, hope, expectancies, fatalism). Participants were 188 primarily African American male early adolescents ranging from 10 to 15 years old (60.6% male; Mage = 12.87, SDage = 1.52). Adolescents in the high- and low-future orientation profiles differed on academic behaviors and aggressive behavior. A discordant profile emerged with adolescents moderate on all measures of future orientation except expectancies. Relational aspects of parenting were associated with higher likelihood of adolescents being assigned to the high- and low-future orientation profiles. These findings suggest the importance of parental warmth in promoting future orientation for adolescents in risky environments, as improving future orientation might mitigate risk for future negative academic comes or engagement in violent behavior.","Psychosocial Maturation, Race, and Desistance from Crime.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115784,Journal of youth and adolescence,2019 05 22,"Research on maturation and its relation to antisocial behavior has progressed appreciably in recent years. Psychosocial maturation is a relatively recent concept of development that scholarship has linked to risky behavior. Psychosocial maturation appears to be a promising explanation of the process of exiting criminal behavior, known as desistance from crime. However, to date, research has not examined whether psychosocial maturation is related to desistance in similar ways across race/ethnicity. Using the Pathways to Desistance Study which followed a mixed-race/ethnicity group of serious adolescent offenders for 7 years, this research tested growth in psychosocial maturation across race/ethnic groups. The sample (14.46% female, average age 15.97 at baseline) was composed of white (n = 250), black (n = 463), and Hispanic (n = 414) individuals. The results showed variation in trajectories of psychosocial maturation with blacks having higher initial levels but slower growth in maturation over time compared to whites. Psychosocial maturation was negatively related to crime across all racial/ethnic groups. Across all racial/ethnic groups, differences in the magnitude of the association between psychosocial maturation and desistance were small. Rather than needing distinct theories for specific groups, psychosocial maturation appears to be a general theoretical perspective for understanding desistance from crime across races/ethnicities. Policy formulation based on psychosocial maturation would, therefore, be applicable across racial/ethnic groups.",Prevalence and clinical presentation of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: A single centre experience from southern India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115783,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,2019 06 10,There are scanty data from India on the prevalence and clinical profile of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM).,Various approaches for measurement of synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the central nerve terminal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115782,Archives of pharmacal research,2019 06 13,"At the presynaptic terminal, neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs), which are released and recycled via exo- and endocytosis. SV endocytosis is crucial for sustaining synaptic transmission by maintaining the SV pool. Many studies have shown that presynaptic dysfunction, particularly impairment of SV endocytosis, is related to neurological disorders. Notably, the presynaptic terminal is considered to be a sensitive structure because certain presynaptic dysfunctions, manifested as impaired SV endocytosis or ultrastructural changes in the presynaptic terminal, can be observed before there is a biochemical or pathological evidence of a neurological disorder. Therefore, monitoring and assessing the presynaptic function by SV endocytosis facilitates the development of early markers for neurological disorders. In this study, we reviewed the current methods for assessing and visualizing SV endocytosis at the central nerve terminal."

The drugs used to treat TS are relatively limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rhynchophylline (RH) and the underlying mechanism in 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI)-induced neurotoxicity in a TS rat model. A TS model was induced with DOI. The rats were divided into control, TS, TS + tiapride (25 mg/kg), and TS + RH (20 and 40 mg/kg) groups. Behavioral tests were performed 24 h after the last administration by nodding and stereotype experiments. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in striatum and serum were detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signal proteins in the striatum. The expression of TLR2 and NF-κB p65 subunit was detected with immunohistochemical analysis. RH may significantly improve behavioral changes in rats with DOI-induced TS and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors in serum and striatum. RH inhibited the activation of TLR/NLRP3/NF-κB signaling proteins in the striatum of TS rats. In BV2 cells, DOI-induced inflammation mediated through TLR/NLRP3/NF-κB was significantly inhibited following RH administration. The therapeutic effect of RH in TS was studied and its mechanism of action mediated via the TLR/NLRP3/NF-κB pathway was clarified in vitro and in vivo.",Protective Effects of Tyrosol Against DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115770,Inflammation,2019 05 22,"In this study, the effects of tyrosol were investigated in DSS-induced experimental ulcerative colitis model. For this purpose, rats were divided into five groups of seven rats in each: control group, colitis group (DSS-4%), tyrosol group (tyrosol 20 mg/kg), sulfasalazine (sulfasalazine+DSS 100 mg/kg), and treatment group (tyrosol+DSS 20 mg/kg). In the study, the active substances were administered to all animals for a period of 21 days. At the end of the study, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased (p < 0.001); GSH level (p < 0.05) along with GSH.Px (p < 0.01) and CAT (p < 0.001) activities decreased in the DSS-induced colitis group. However, with the administration of tyrosol, MDA and GSH levels along with GSH.Px and CAT activities came to the same levels as the control group. In the colitis group, an increase occurred in IL-6, COX-2, and NF-κB parameters, which created a significant difference compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Similarly, TNF-α levels also significantly increased with the administration of DSS (p < 0.05) which created a significant difference compared to the control group, while there was no difference among the other groups. As for the Nrf-2 data, it decreased with the administration of DSS which created a significant difference compared to the control group (p < 0.05), while there was no difference in other groups. In the colitis-induced group, IL-6, COX-2, and NF-κB gene expression levels also similarly increased but returned to the normal levels with the administration of tyrosol. In the histopathological scoring, the negativity that increased with the administration of DSS returned to the normal levels with the administration of tyrosol+DSS. In conclusion, according to the data obtained, tyrosol fixed the destruction picture in the DSS-induced colitis model, giving rise to thought that it has a protective effect.",Early maternal circulating alkaline phosphatase with subsequent gestational diabetes mellitus and glucose regulation: a prospective cohort study in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115769,Endocrine,2019 05 22,"Emerging clinical evidence has implied that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may contribute to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Many studies have presented various ways of protecting biometric data especially finger vein biometric data. Thus, It is needs to find better ways of securing this data by applying the three principles of information security aforementioned, and creating a robust verification system with high levels of reliability, privacy and security. Moreover, it is very difficult to replace biometric information and any leakage of biometrics information leads to earnest risks for example replay attacks using the robbed biometric data.

Three new complexes, {[RuCl(H2biim)(η6-p-cymene)]PF6}2·H2O (1), [(η5-Cp)RhCl(H2biim)]PF6 (2), and [(η5-Cp)IrCl(H2biim)]PF6 (3), were fully characterized by CHN, X-ray diffraction analysis, UV-Vis, FTIR, and 1H, 13C and 15N NMR spectroscopies. The complexes exhibit a typical pseudooctahedral piano-stool geometry, in which the aromatic arene ring (p-cymene or Cp) forms the seat, while the bidentate 2,2'-biimidazole and chloride ion form the three legs of the piano stool. Moreover, the cytotoxic activities of the compounds were examined in the LoVo, HL-60, MV-4-11, MCF-7 human cancer cell lines and BALB/3T3 normal mouse fibroblasts. Notably, the investigated complexes showed no cytotoxic effects towards the normal BALB/3T3 cell line compared to cisplatin, which has an IC50 value of 2.20 µg. Importantly, 1 displayed the highest activity against HL-60 (IC50 4.35 µg). To predict a binding mode, we explored the potential interactions of the metal complexes with CT-DNA and protein using UV absorption and circular dichroism. The obtained data suggest that the complexes could interact with CT-DNA via an outside binding mode. Moreover, binding of the complexes with the GSH via UV-Vis and ESI mass spectra was determined. Comparative studies have shown that the rhodium complex (2) is the most GSH reactive, which is probably responsible for its deactivation towards LoVo and MCF-7 tumour cells. The influence of the metal ion on the biological activity of isostructural Rh(III) and Ir(III) complexes was an important goal of the presented investigation.",Experimental and theoretical studies of the porphyrin ligand effect on the electronic structure and reactivity of oxoiron(iv) porphyrin π-cation-radical complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115764,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,2019 05 22,"Oxoiron(IV) porphyrin π-cation-radical complexes (Cpd I) have been studied as models for reactive intermediates called compound I in cytochromes P450, peroxidases, and catalases. It has been well known that the electronic structure and reactivity of Cpd I are modulated by the substituted position and the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent. However, there still remain two major questions: (1) how many electronegative halogen atoms should be introduced in the meso-phenyl group to switch the porphyrin π-cation-radical state of Cpd I? (2) How does the electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent modulate the reactivity of Cpd I? To answer these two questions, we here performed experimental and theoretical studies on the electron-withdrawing effect of the meso-substituent. We gradually increased the electron-withdrawing effect by increasing the number of fluorine atoms in the meso-phenyl group. Spectroscopic analyses of these Cpd I models reveal that the porphyrin radical state shifts from having a2u radical character to having a1u radical character with an increase in the number of the fluorine atoms in the phenyl group, and the ground state of Cpd I switches from the a2u state to the a1u state when four fluorine atoms are introduced in the meso-phenyl group. The switch of the radical state is predicted well by LC-BLYP, but not by the commonly used B3LYP. The theoretical calculations indicate that the electron-withdrawing substituent makes Cpd I more reactive by stabilizing the ferric porphyrin state (product state) more than the Cpd I state (reactant state), generating a larger free energy change in the oxygenation reaction (ΔG) of Cpd I.",Emergence of metal selectivity and promiscuity in metalloenzymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115763,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,2019 05 22,"Metal coordination with proteinaceous ligands has greatly expanded the chemical toolbox of proteins and their biological roles. The structure and function of natural metalloproteins have been determined according to the physicochemical properties of metal ions bound to the active sites. Concurrently, amino acid sequences are optimized for metal coordination geometry and/or dedicated action of metal ions in proteinaceous environments. In some occasions, however, natural enzymes exhibit promiscuous reactivity with more than one designated metal ion, under in vitro and/or in vivo conditions. In this review, we discuss selected examples of metalloenzymes that bind various first-row, mid- to late-transition metal ions for their native catalytic activities. From these examples, we suggest that environmental, inorganic, and biochemical factors, such as bioavailability, native organism, cellular compartment, reaction mechanism, binding affinity, protein sequence, and structure, might be responsible for determining metal selectivity or promiscuity. The current work proposes how natural metalloproteins might have emerged and adapted for specific metal incorporation under the given circumstances and may provide insights into the design and engineering of de novo metalloproteins.",Comparison of different combinations of maximum medical therapy for lowering intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma: 12-month retrospective consecutive case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115761,Japanese journal of ophthalmology,2019 05 22,To compare the efficacy and safety of two combinations of maximum medical therapy for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).,"Dynamic, patient-specific mitral valve modelling for planning transcatheter repairs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115756,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 06 15,"Transcatheter, beating heart repair techniques for mitral valve regurgitation is a very active area of development.

We collected quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effectiveness of the demonstration in both a police-led environment (Experiment 1) and a laboratory environment (Experiment 2). We also compared the change blindness intervention to two control tasks. The results showed that participants' self-reported ability to spot important visual changes was reduced after the change blindness demonstration in both experiments, but was not reduced after participation in the control tasks of Experiment 2. Furthermore, participants described the change blindness demonstrations positively and would recommend that they were shown more widely.",RNA-seq and microRNA-seq analysis of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) larvae treated by thyroid hormones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115741,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 05 22,"Flatfish pigmentation is a complex process, affected by environmental factors including light, nutrients, and hormones.

By comparison of albinism rate, T3 treatment and control larvae of 42 DAH were chosen for mRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing analyses. A total of 337 miRNAs were identified via miRNA-seq, and 12 miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression patterns in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (TPM > 10, fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67 and q ≤ 0.05). These differentially expressed miRNAs targeted 3658 putative genes, which further enriched to 10 GO terms (q < 0.05). RNA-seq identified 146 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (|log2 fold change| > 1 and q < 0.005), including pigmentation-related genes such as the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3, pro-opiomelanocortin A, and melanotransferrin, and the growth-related gene somatotropin. These DEGs were significantly enriched to 15 GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways (q < 0.05), which included several sugar metabolic pathways (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway). Integrated analysis revealed that 26 overlapping genes between DEGs and mRNAs were targeted by miRNAs. Furthermore, seven mRNA-miRNA pairs exhibited reversed regulation patterns.

To better understand relationships between total Hg (THg) concentrations in feathers and other tissues for birds in the thrush and sparrow families, we (1) examined variation in THg concentrations among tissues, including feathers from six different tracts, nails, liver, and muscle; (2) tested relationships between THg concentrations in the various feather tracts and those in internal tissues from the same birds, to assess the predictive power of feather THg, and; (3) compared these relationships to those between THg concentrations in nails and internal tissues, to assess the viability of nails as a non-lethal sampling alternative. THg concentrations in all feather tracts and nails were consistently higher than those in the liver and muscle, and THg was higher in the thrushes than the sparrows. When comparing feather tracts, we observed high variation within some individuals, suggesting that estimates of Hg exposure could vary depending on which feather was sampled. Despite this variation, feather type had little effect on the predictive power of feather THg concentrations, which ranged from extremely weak in the sparrows (0.09 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.16) to moderate (0.29 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.42) in the thrushes. Alternatively, we found that nail samples better predicted internal tissue THg concentrations in both the thrushes (0.44 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.48) and sparrows (0.70 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.78). Nails have been used to monitor Hg in mammals and reptiles, but their reliability as a sampling matrix for monitoring Hg in avian populations has yet to be assessed for most taxa. While nails exhibit stronger relationships to internal tissue THg concentrations, they may not be an effective sampling option for all avian species because the collection of sizable nail samples could harm living birds, particularly small songbirds. However, this method may be reasonable for retrospective museum studies. Overall, our results suggest that, despite their current use in the literature, feathers are not a suitable sampling matrix for Hg monitoring in some songbird species.",Community Health Workers in the Emergency Department-Can they Help with Chronic Hypertension Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115736,Current hypertension reports,2019 06 10,To review community health worker (CHW) interventions tailored for hypertension management and to determine if the emergency department (ED) population would benefit from such interventions.,N-Acetylcysteine extends lifespan of Drosophila via modulating ROS scavenger gene expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115735,Biogerontology,2019 05 22,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAc) has been shown to play a diversity of favorable health-related roles (e.g., antioxidant, paracetamol antidote, mucolytics, neuroprotective agent).

We note that 1 mg/ml NAc prolonged the lifespan of Drosophila. Furthermore, it was observed that NAc increased the capability of these flies to resist environmental stresses measured by starvation and paraquat stress assays. In an effort to reveal cellular mechanisms behind this interesting phenomenon, qPCR was performed, uncovering that transcript levels of catalase and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase-key enzymes to fend off reactive oxygen species (ROS) assaults, were up-regulated. Correspondingly, enzyme activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase were increased as well. Combined, we hope our research helps broaden the spectrum of clinical application for NAc so that one may eventually determine if NAc is a potentially useful anti-aging agent by encouraging others to scrutinize the hidden health benefits of NAc."

We investigated supplementing the same combination of nucleosides to seed bioreactors and production fed batch bioreactors. In the seed bioreactors, growth rate and harvest density were improved. However, in the production fed batch bioreactors, no improvements in growth rate or peak viable cell density were observed. Cell cycle analysis of the passaging cells provides evidence that nucleosides can affect the cell cycle. It is not clear from our work how the nucleosides impact the cell cycle regulatory pathways.

In particular, immobilization of bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) to the scaffold surface may facilitate rapid and robust integration of the scaffold with adjacent bone tissues. As a first step toward testing this, model PCL surfaces were modified by the addition of heparin (Hep) and BMP-2 to facilitate osteoblastic differentiation. Specifically, Hep was combined with PCL at 0, 0.5, and 1 wt% (denoted as PCL, PCL-0.5Hep, and PCL-1Hep), cast into films, and then BMP-2 was immobilized to surfaces by either adsorption and covalent conjugation. Here, BMP-2 concentration increased systematically with incorporation of Hep, and higher concentrations were achieved by covalent conjugation. Next, blends were electrospun to form thin meshes with fiber diameters of 0.92, 0.62, and 0.54 μm for PCL, PCL-0.5Hep, and PCL-1Hep, respectively. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) had no difficulty attaching to and proliferating on all meshes. Lastly, PCL-1Hep meshes were prepared with adsorbed or covalently conjugated BMP-2 and cultured with MSCs in the absence of osteogenic factors. Under these conditions, alkaline phosphatase activity and deposition of bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and calcium minerals-markers of osteoblastic differentiation-were significantly higher on surfaces with immobilized BMP-2. Together, these data indicate that covalent immobilization of trophic factors confers bioactivity to scaffolds, which may be applied in a spatially controlled manner for ligament regeneration and bone integration.",The multi-user evolutionary game simulation in water quality-based water source system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115718,Environmental geochemistry and health,2019 05 22,"Water is a crucial factor for human living and maintaining ecological system health. Water resource conflict has become an important factor which restricts regional economic development and affects the harmony and stability of society. This paper, on the one hand, builds a trilateral evolution game model of water intaking in the upper, middle, and lower reaches in terms of water-quality conflict, and makes an analysis of the evolutionary stable strategy of the model on the foundation of a cross-border water resource conflict warning system and based on the view of evolution game. The paper verifies related conclusions by using numerical simulation calculation examples and makes sensitivity analysis of the change of the parameters of the model. The result of the research indicates that (1) there are three groups of system local gradual stable points [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] in the trilateral game of water quality-based cross-border conflicts. This means that there are three groups of evolutionary stable strategies: (non-cooperation, non-cooperation, cooperation), (cooperation, non-cooperation, cooperation), and (non-cooperation, cooperation, cooperation). The conclusion obtained via verification by using numerical simulation is that upper and middle reaches are the sections which most likely lead to conflicts, so the strategy selected therefor is (non-cooperation, non-cooperation, cooperation); (2) in water quality-based cross-border conflict, the factor [Formula: see text] of compensation cost increased because excessive transfer of pollutants has a significant effect on water-intaking group strategy evolution path. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to the scientific operation of cross-border water quality and water amount conflicts and the realization of the goal of water resources management.",Application of a soil quality assessment system using ecotoxicological indicators to evaluate contaminated and remediated soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115717,Environmental geochemistry and health,2019 05 22,"The deterioration of soil quality owing to human activities results in adverse effects on the soil ecosystem. This study developed a systematic method to quantitatively evaluate soil quality based on physical, chemical, biological, and ecotoxicological indicators and proposed the soil quality assessment and management system. This system consists of step-by-step processes, including indicator classification, indicator measurement, scoring and weighting, and soil quality index (SQI) calculation. The novel strategy included the usage of authentic ecotoxicological indicators for realistically interpreting soil quality assessment results. This study used five ecotoxicological indicators, including earthworm survival, enzyme activities, nematode reproduction, plant germination and growth, soil algal biomass, and soil algal photosynthetic capacity. Relatively higher SQI values than those corresponding to the actual soil quality status would be obtained without considering the ecotoxicological indicators. We conclude that the use of ecotoxicological indicator can help in soil quality assessment even under extreme soil quality conditions, such as highly contaminated or physically and chemically remediated soils.",The heat-tolerance evaluation of an Isochrysis zhangjiangensis mutant generated by atmospheric and room temperature plasmas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115716,AMB Express,2019 06 10,"Isochrysis zhangjiangensis is widely used in the marine aquaculture as larval feed, especially for filter feeding cultures, as well as a good candidate for biofuels. However, the optimal cultivation temperature for I. zhangjiangensis is below 30 °C and this stain is seriously affected by high temperature, which causes the limited application during the summer. I. zhangjiangensis IM130005 is a strain generated by atmospheric and room temperature plasmas with relative higher growth rate and lipid production than the wide strain (WT), with the ability to tolerate several hours' high temperature during the outdoor cultivation. Here, a detailed comparison was performed by continuous monitoring growth, chlorophyll fluorescence and fatty acid profile between IM13005 and WT under a mimic temperature shock to the summer outdoor cultivation. Based on a nearly 20% increase of total fatty acid in IM13005, which was majorly contributed by saturated or monounsaturated FAs in form of neutral lipids, within 5 h under the heat shock, the fatty acids and lipids synthesis variation were postulated as the physiological reason for the high temperature tolerance.",A Novel Method for Identifying the Potential Cancer Driver Genes Based on Molecular Data Integration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115714,Biochemical genetics,2019 05 22,"The identification of the cancer driver genes is essential for personalized therapy. The mutation frequency of most driver genes is in the middle (2-20%) or even lower range, which makes it difficult to find the driver genes with low-frequency mutations. Other forms of genomic aberrations, such as copy number variations (CNVs) and epigenetic changes, may also reflect cancer progression. In this work, a method for identifying the potential cancer driver genes (iPDG) based on molecular data integration is proposed. DNA copy number variation, somatic mutation, and gene expression data of matched cancer samples are integrated. In combination with the method of iKEEG, the ""key genes"" of cancer are identified, and the change in their expression levels is used for auxiliary evaluation of whether the mutated genes are potential drivers. For a mutated gene, the concept of mutational effect is defined, which takes into account the effects of copy number variation, mutation gene itself, and its neighbor genes. The method mainly includes two steps: the first step is data preprocessing. First, DNA copy number variation and somatic mutation data are integrated. Then, the integrated data are mapped to a given interaction network, and the diffusion kernel is used to form the mutation effect matrix. The second step is to obtain the key genes by using the iKGGE method, and construct the connection matrix by means of the gene expression data of the key genes and mutation impact matrix of the mutated genes. Experiments on TCGA breast cancer and Glioblastoma multiforme datasets demonstrate that iPDG is effective not only to identify the known cancer driver genes but also to discover the rare potential driver genes. When measured by functional enrichment analysis, we find that these genes are clearly associated with these two types of cancers.",A comparison of peptide amphiphile nanofiber macromolecular assembly strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115713,"The European physical journal.

The self-assembly mechanisms of these peptide nanofibers also provide convenient models for understanding the self-assembly mechanisms of various biological supramolecular systems; however, the current theoretical models that explain these mechanisms do not sufficiently explain the experimental results. In this study, we present a new way of modeling these nanofibers that better fits with the experimental data. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to create model fibers using two different layer models and two different tilt angles. Strikingly, the fibers which were modeled to be tilting the peptide amphiphile molecules and/or tilting the plane were found to be more stable and consistent with the experiments.",Systemic Vasculitis Associated With Immune Check Point Inhibition: Analysis and Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115712,Current rheumatology reports,2019 06 10,"Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become a well-established modality to treat a number of different malignancies, especially in cases with advanced stages and/or recurrent diseases.

The Hennops and Jukskei Rivers lying in the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment are two of the worst impacted rivers in South Africa and are in need of rehabilitation. Passive sampling (Chemcatcher® with a HLB receiving phase) together with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry-targeted screening was used to provide high sensitivity and selectivity for the identification of a wide range of emerging pollutants in these urban waters. Over 200 compounds, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, drugs of abuse and their metabolites were identified. Many substances (~ 180) being detected for the first time in surface water in South Africa. General medicines and psychotropic drugs were the two most frequently detected groups in the catchment. These accounted for 49% of the emerging pollutants found. Of the general medicines, antihypertensive agents, beta-blocking and cardiac drugs were the most abundant (28%) classes detected. The Hennops site, downstream of a dysfunctional wastewater treatment plant, was the most polluted with 123 substances detected. From the compounds detected, peak intensity-based prioritisation was used to identify the five most abundant pollutants, being in the order caffeine > lopinavir > sulfamethoxazole > cotinine > trimethoprim. This work provides the largest available high-quality dataset of emerging pollutants detected in South African urban waters.

Highly ordered periodic structural properties and morphology were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Compared with planar samples, cathodoluminescence measurement revealed that NR samples showed 1.92-fold light extraction efficiency (LEE) enhancement and a 12.2-fold internal quantum efficiency (IQE) enhancement for the emission from multi-quantum wells at approximately 277 nm. The LEE enhancement can be attributed to the well-fabricated nanostructured interface between the air and the epilayers. Moreover, the reduced quantum-confined stark effect accounted for the great enhancement in IQE.","An update on Burkitt lymphoma: a review of pathogenesis and multimodality imaging assessment of disease presentation, treatment response, and recurrence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115699,Insights into imaging,2019 06 10,"Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive, rapidly growing B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which manifests in several subtypes including sporadic, endemic, and immunodeficiency-associated forms.

BL affects nearly every organ system, most commonly the abdomen and pelvis in the sporadic form. Imaging using a multimodality approach plays a crucial role in the management of BL from diagnosis, staging, and evaluation of treatment response to therapy-related complications with ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography playing roles.

To overcome difficulties regarding lymph node dissection (LND), a scope holder and an energy device were used, allowing fine dissection in a fixed field of view. The overlap gastro-gastrostomy technique was used for anastomosis. Seventeen patients underwent solo SIPGG. The mean operation time was 150.1 ± 28.7 min, and no patients developed postoperative complications or delayed gastric emptying within 30 days of the operation. Using scope holders and performing fine dissection with the energy device, challenges regarding LND in SIPPG can be overcome. INTACT anastomosis was initially used; however, due to its inconsistency and the high degree of surgical skill required, it was changed to the overlap method. Solo SIPPG with overlap gastro-gastrostomy may be safe and feasible with good cosmetic results and fast patient recovery.",Transcriptomic analysis of Chinese wild Vitis pseudoreticulata in response to Plasmopara viticola.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115695,Protoplasma,2019 05 22,"Downy mildew, resulted from Plasmopara viticola, is one of most severe fungal diseases of grapevine. Since Vitis vinifera is susceptible to downy mildew, much effort has been focused on improving the resistance of V. vinifera. The Chinese wild V. pseudoreticulata accession Baihe-35-1 (BH) shows resistance to P. viticola; however, the molecular mechanism underlying its resistance to P. viticola is largely unknown. In order to better understand the cellular processes, the transcriptomic changes were investigated at 0, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 120 h post infection (hpi). Transcriptome analysis identified a total of 175 differentially expressed genes. Most of them were found to be associated with oxidative stress, cell wall modification, and protein modification. Moreover, the BH resistance to P. viticola was involved in metabolism process, including terpene synthesis and hormone synthesis. In addition, we verified 12 genes to ensure the accuracy of transcriptome data using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This study broadly characterizes a molecular mechanism in which oxidative stress and cell wall biosynthesis and modification play important roles in the response of BH to P. viticola and provides a basis for further analysis of key genes involved in the resistance to P. viticola.",Appraisal of immediate and late effects of mobile phone radiations at 2100 MHz on mitotic activity and DNA integrity in root meristems of Allium cepa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115694,Protoplasma,2019 05 22,"The present study evaluated the potential of 2100 MHz radiofrequency radiations to act as cytotoxic and genotoxic agent. Fresh onion (Allium cepa L.) roots were exposed to electromagnetic field radiations (EMF-r) for different durations (1 h and 4 h) and evaluated for mitotic index (MI), phase index, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA damage. DNA damage was investigated with the help of the comet assay by assessing various parameters like % head DNA (HDNA), % tail DNA (TDNA), tail moment (TM), and olive tail moment (OTM). Effects of EMF-r exposure were also compared with that of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; 90 μM), which acted as a positive control. The post-exposure effects of EMF-r after providing the test plants with an acclimatization period of 24 h were also evaluated. Compared to the control, a significant increase in the MI and aberration percentage was recorded upon 4 h of exposure. However, no specific trend of phase index in response to exposure was detected. EMF-r exposure incited DNA damage with a significant decrease in HDNA accompanied by an increase in TDNA upon exposure of 4 h. However, TM and OTM did not change significantly upon exposure as compared to that of control. Analysis of the post-exposure effects of EMF-r did not show any significant change/recovery. Our data, thus, suggest the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic nature of 2100 MHz EMF-r.

Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations: bilateral cataract and chronic diarrhea during childhood, then occurrence of neurological debilitating symptoms in adulthood (cognitive decline, motor disorders). Plasma cholestanol is used as a diagnostic marker of CTX, and to monitor the response to the treatment. Current treatment for CTX is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which was reported to improve and/or stabilize clinical status and decrease levels of plasma cholestanol. Rare published reports have also suggested a potential efficacy of cholic acid (CA) in patients with CTX. In this retrospective Franco-Belgian multicentric study, we collected data from 12 patients treated with CA, evaluating their clinical status, cholestanol levels and adverse effects during the treatment period. The population was divided in two subgroups: treatment-naive (who never had CDCA prior to CA) and non-treatment-naive patients (who had CDCA prior to CA introduction). We found that treatment with CA significantly and strongly reduced cholestanol levels in all patients. Additionally, 10 out of 12 patients clinically improved or stabilized with CA treatment. Worsening was noted in one treatment-naïve patient and one non-treatment-naïve patient, but both patients experienced similar outcomes with CDCA treatment as well. No adverse effects were reported from patients with CA treatment, whereas elevated transaminases were observed in some patients while they were treated with CDCA. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CA may be a suitable alternative treatment for CTX, especially in patients with side effects related to CDCA.",Myopathy and scleromyxedema.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115676,Journal of neurology,2019 05 22,"Scleromyxedema is a chronic, idiopathic disorder associated with monoclonal gammopathy, and characterized by dermal mucin deposition.

Nonetheless, compared to tremor and gait impairment, less emphasis has been placed on the quantification of bradykinesia and rigidity. This review aimed to consolidate the existing research on objective measurement of bradykinesia and rigidity in PD through the use of wearables, focusing on the continuous monitoring of these two symptoms in free-living environments. A search of PubMed was conducted through a combination of keyword and MeSH searches. We also searched the IEEE, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases to ensure thorough results and to minimize the chances of missing relevant studies. Papers published after the year 2000 with sample sizes greater than five were included. Studies were assessed for quality and information was extracted regarding the devices used and their location on the body, the setting and duration of the study, the ""gold standard"" used as a reference for validation, the metrics used, and the results of each paper. Thirty-one and eight studies met the search criteria and evaluated bradykinesia and rigidity, respectively. Several studies reported strong associations between wearable-based measures and the gold-standard references for bradykinesia, and, to a lesser extent, rigidity. Only a few, pilot studies investigated the measurement of bradykinesia and rigidity in the home and free-living settings. While the current results are promising for the future of wearables, additional work is needed on their validation and adaptation in ecological, free-living settings. Doing so has the potential to improve the assessment and treatment of motor fluctuations and symptoms of PD more generally through real-time objective monitoring of bradykinesia and rigidity.","Differences in the health, mental health and health-promoting behaviours of rural versus urban cancer survivors in Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115668,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2019 05 22,"People affected by cancer who live in rural Australia experience inferior survival compared to their urban counterparts.

NK cells exhibit phases of expansion, contraction and memory formation in response to the natural mouse pathogen murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Innate and adaptive immune responses are tightly regulated in mammals to avoid excess tissue damage while preventing acute and chronic viral disease and assuring resistance to reinfection. Caspase (CASP)8 is an autoactivating aspartate-specific cysteine protease that initiates extrinsic apoptosis and prevents receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinase (RIPK)1-RIPK3-driven necroptosis. CASP8 also promotes death-independent signal transduction. All of these activities make contributions to inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that CASP8 restricts NK cell expansion during MCMV infection but does not influence NK memory. Casp8-/-Ripk3-/- mice mount higher NK response levels than Casp8+/-Ripk3-/- littermate controls or WT C57BL/6 J mice, indicating that RIPK3 deficiency alone does not contribute to NK response patterns. MCMV m157-responsive Ly49H+ NK cells support increased expansion of both Ly49H- NK cells and CD8 T cells in Casp8-/-Ripk3-/- mice. Surprisingly, hyperaccumulation of NK cells depends on the pronecrotic kinase RIPK1. Ripk1-/-Casp8-/-Ripk3-/- mice fail to show the enhanced expansion of lymphocytes observed in Casp8-/-Ripk3-/- mice even though development and homeostasis are preserved in uninfected Ripk1-/-Casp8-/-Ripk3-/- mice. Thus, CASP8 naturally regulates the magnitude of NK cell responses in response to infection where strong activation signals depend on another key regulator of death signaling, RIPK1. In addition, the strong NK cell response promotes survival of effector CD8 T cells during their expansion. Thus, hyperaccumulation of NK cells and crosstalk with T cells becomes amplified in the absence of extrinsic cell death machinery.",Therapeutic application of the CRISPR system: current issues and new prospects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115652,Human genetics,2019 06 10,"Since its discovery, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (the CRISPR) system has been increasingly applied to therapeutic genome editing. Employment of several viral and non-viral vectors has enabled efficient delivery of the CRISPR system to target cells or tissues. In addition, the CRISPR system is able to modulate the target gene's expression in various ways, such as mutagenesis, gene integration, epigenome regulation, chromosomal rearrangement, base editing and mRNA editing. However, there are still limitations hindering an ideal application of the system: inefficient delivery, dysregulation of the delivered gene, the immune response against the CRISPR system, the off-target effects or the unintended on-target mutations. In addition, there are recent discoveries that have not been yet applied to CRISPR-mediated therapeutic genome editing.

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and coding sequences of an up-to-date bacterial core gene set (92 protein clusters) indicated that strain HPM-16T formed a phylogenetic lineage in the genus Neptunomonas. Strain HPM-16T was most closely related to Neptunomonas concharum LHW37T with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 96.7%. Cells were Gram-stain negative, facultatively anaerobic, motile by means of a single polar flagellum, rod-shaped and formed white colonies. Optimal growth occurred at 30-35 °C, pH 6.5-8, and in the presence of 2-5% NaCl. C18:1ω7c and summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c and/or C16:1ω6c) were the predominant fatty acids. The only isoprenoid quinone was Q-8. The polar lipid profile revealed the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and several uncharacterized lipids. The major polyamines were putrescine and spermidine. The draft genome was approximately 3.68 Mb in size with a G + C content of 50.5 mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic inference, demonstrate that strain HPM-16T should be classified as a novel species of the genus Neptunomonas, for which the name Neptunomonas marina sp. nov. is presented. The type strain is HPM-16T (= BCRC 80980T = LMG 29560T = KCTC 52235T).",Long-Term Effects of Teriparatide Followed by Antiresorptive Therapy on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Severe Spinal Osteoporosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115640,Calcified tissue international,2019 05 22,"Teriparatide (TPTD) is the most widely used anabolic agent in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis although its use is restricted in many countries. A recent randomised trial confirmed that TPTD was superior to risedronate at preventing vertebral fractures over a 2-year period. There is limited information on the relative effectiveness of TPTD compared with standard care in routine clinical practice. In this paper, we report the results of an extended observational study of 724 women referred to a specialist clinic with severe osteoporosis over an 11.5-year period, who were considered for TPTD therapy. Of these patients, 496 (68.5%) were treated with TPTD, whereas the remaining 228 (31.5%) received other treatments. This was either because they were unwilling or unable to self-inject (52.6%), because they had already been established on oral bisphosphonates (31.1%) or because of contraindications (12.7%). The TPTD group were younger than the standard care group (69.6 vs. 74.1 years) and had a lower 10-year fracture risk (25.7% vs. 28.6%). Those treated with TPTD had a greater increase in BMD at the lumbar spine compared with standard care (13.3% vs. 8.2%, p < 0.001) after approximately 2 years and had a lower incidence of vertebral fractures (4.8% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.01) over the course of our observation. There was no difference between groups with respect to either BMD change at the femoral neck or incidence of non-vertebral fractures. This study confirms that TPTD is superior to standard care at reducing the risk of vertebral fracture in patients with severe osteoporosis.","The Association of Aromatic Amino Acids with Incident Hip Fracture, aBMD, and Body Composition from the Cardiovascular Health Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115639,Calcified tissue international,2019 05 22,"In 5187 persons from the Cardiovascular Health Study, there was no significant association of dietary intakes of aromatic amino acids (AAA) with areal BMD of the hip or body composition. However, those who had the lowest dietary intakes of AAA were at increased risk for incident hip fractures. Prior studies of the association of protein intake with osteoporosis are conflicting and have not directly examined the relationship of aromatic amino acids (AAA) with fractures, areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and body composition. We sought to determine the relationship of dietary intakes of AAA with osteoporosis parameters in elderly men and women. 5187 men and women aged ≥ 65 years from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) with dietary intakes of AAA (tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) estimated by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were included. We examined the relationship between a one-time estimate of daily dietary AAA intake with risk of incident hip fractures over a median of 13.2 years of fracture follow-up. A subset (n = 1336) who had dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) performed were included in a cross-sectional analysis of the association of dietary AAA intake with aBMD of the total hip and measurements of body composition. In multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, medication use, and diet, higher dietary AAA intake was not significantly associated with incident hip fractures. All hazard ratios (HR) were less than one (tryptophan, HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.89; phenylalanine, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.55; tyrosine, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.32), but confidence intervals were wide and included no difference. However, in post hoc analyses, the lowest quartile of intake for each AAA was associated with an increased risk for hip fracture compared to higher quartiles (p ≤ 0.047 for all). Dietary AAA intakes were not significantly associated with total hip aBMD or any measurements of body composition. Overall, there was no significant association of dietary AAA intake with hip fractures, aBMD of the hip, or body composition. However, there may be a subset of elderly individuals with low dietary intakes of AAA who are at increased for hip fractures."

Lactobacillus rhamnosus in mouse intestinal mucosa a mutant of the red fluorescence protein (RFP) DSred2 was used to tag L. rhamnosus to observe the adhesion and distribution of L. rhamnosus in mouse intestinal mucosa. A mutant of the red fluorescence protein (RFP) Dsred2 was used to tag L. rhamnosus to allow us to observe and distinguish it in the mouse intestine. Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were fed once (at day 0) with an oral administration of the labeled L. rhamnosus, and the number of labeled bacteria was detected in different regions of the intestinal tract at 3 h and at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 15 after administration. The labeling process changed the morphology of L. rhamnosus, as it appeared after observation under the microscope, but did not change its basic probiotic properties in vitro. In vivo, labeled L. rhamnosus reached the colonization peak at the fourth day after gavage. From the distribution point of view, the number of colonization strains increased from the proximal to the distal small intestine (duodenum < jejunum < ileum) and the number of strains in the colon was less than the distal small intestine (ileum).

As a consequence, this issue is either underevaluated or alternatively, instruments originally designed for cancer patients are being used. We therefore started to systematically develop a AA/PNH-specific QoL (QLQ-AA/PNH) instrument in these ultra-rare diseases according to European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines. While phases I and II of the process have previously been published, we now report on the resulting instrument (phase III of this process). As part of the phase III of the evaluation process, we approached patients through physicians, patient support groups, and patient conferences. After participants completed the preliminary questionnaire and reported socio-demographic data, they were interviewed in person or via phone with a debriefing interview to find out whether the items were relevant, easy to understand, and acceptable to patients and whether there was anything missing in the questionnaire. We hypothesised what items could be combined into a scale and calculated Cronbach's alpha to define its preliminary internal consistency. After definition of a priori criteria to keep or delete items, a group of six experts met in person, discussed the results, and decided on in- or exclusion. A total of 48 patients were enrolled, 21 of those suffered from AA (44%), 13 from PNH (27%), and 14 from AA/PNH syndrome (29%). The median time to complete the 69 items was 10 min (range 5-20), mean time 11 min. The compliance criterion (> 95% completion) was fulfilled by 57 items. Twenty-three items were mentioned as especially relevant by ≥ 2% of the patients. Cronbach's alpha of the hypothesised scales ranged from 0.63 (social support) to 0.92 (fear of progression and illness intrusiveness). Finally, 47 items were kept; 16 were deleted, and 5 were changed, while 1 item expanded. This resulted in 54 items in total. As no issues were mentioned to lacking by a minimum of five patients, no items were added to the questionnaire. After completion, the AA/PNH-QoL tool (QLQ-AA/PNH) was translated according to EORTC guidelines into English, French, and Italian. For patients with PNH and AA until now, the standard assessment for QoL was to use the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) or the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Instrument (FACIT-Fatigue). We herewith present a new instrument aimed to be better tailored to the needs of PNH and AA patients. The anticipated fourth development phase will be performed for psychometric validation; however, we already explored the internal consistency of the hypothesised scales and found the results to be very good. Hence, the new QLQ-AA/PNH with 54 items can be used in trials and clinical studies from now on, according to EORTC strategy even if the scoring algorithm at this point is preliminary and the QLQ-AA/PNH might change slightly after phase IV. This is important, as there are no other disease-specific instruments available for AA/PNH patients right now.",Effects of zoledronic acid on bone mineral density around prostheses and bone metabolism markers after primary total hip arthroplasty in females with postmenopausal osteoporosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115592,Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2019 05 22,To investigate the effect of zoledronic acid on periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism markers after primary total hip arthroplasty in females with postmenopausal osteoporosis.,Okadaic acid activates Wnt/β-catenin-signaling in human HepaRG cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115591,Archives of toxicology,2019 05 22,"The lipophilic phycotoxin okadaic acid (OA) occurs in the fatty tissue and hepatopancreas of filter-feeding shellfish. The compound provokes the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) syndrome after intake of seafood contaminated with high levels of the DSP toxin. In animal experiments, long-term exposure to OA is associated with an elevated risk for tumor formation in different organs including the liver. Although OA is a known inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A, the mechanisms behind OA-induced carcinogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the influence of OA on the β-catenin-dependent Wnt-signaling pathway, addressing a major oncogenic pathway relevant for tumor development. We analyzed OA-mediated effects on β-catenin and its biological function, cellular localization, post-translational modifications, and target gene expression in human HepaRG hepatocarcinoma cells treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations up to 50 nM. We detected concentration- and time-dependent effects of OA on the phosphorylation state, cellular redistribution as well as on the amount of transcriptionally active β-catenin. These findings were confirmed by quantitative live-cell imaging of U2OS cells stably expressing a green fluorescent chromobody which specifically recognize hypophosphorylated β-catenin. Finally, we demonstrated that nuclear translocation of β-catenin mediated by non-cytotoxic OA concentrations results in an upregulation of Wnt-target genes. In conclusion, our results show a significant induction of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway by OA in human liver cells. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying OA-induced carcinogenesis."

Immunohistochemical, western blot and RT‑qPCR analyses were performed to detect the expression levels of Sirt6, the markers of podocytes and monocytes and related inflammatory factors in the tissues of rats with streptozocin‑induced DN. A series of cell experiments in isolated culture or the co‑culture of macrophages and podocytes were conducted to examine the effects of the overexpression of Sirt6 on macrophage transformation, podocyte apoptosis and associated genes, and analyses were performed using RT‑qPCR, flow cytometry and western blot analysis, where appropriate. In the rat model of DN, injured podocytes were represented by the decreased protein expression levels of Nephrin and Sirt6, and by an increased Desmin expression. Additionally, the M1 phenotype transformation of macrophages was evidenced by the increased expression levels of CD86, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and by the decreased expression levels of CD206, Sirt6, interleukin (IL)‑4 and IL‑10. In vitro assays of macrophages and podocytes demonstrated that glucose promoted macrophage M1 transformation and podocyte apoptosis in a dose‑dependent manner and attenuated Sirt6 expression. Macrophages transformed into the M2 phenotype following the overexpression of Sirt6 by the successful transfection of macrophages with a Sirt6 overexpression plasmid. Sirt6 was also overexpressed in podocytes. In a Transwell co‑culture system, the overexpression of Sirt6 in macrophages (but not the overexpression of Sirt6 in podocytes) protected the podocytes from high‑glucose‑induced injury. However, the apoptosis of the podocytes overexpressing Sirt6 (induced by transfection with a Sirt6 overexpression plasmid) still increased when these podocytes were co‑cultured with macrophages in high‑glucose medium. These protective effects were evidenced by the inhibition of apoptosis, the upregulation of the expression levels of Bcl‑2 and CD206, as well as by the decreased expression levels of Bax and CD86. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that Sirt6 protects podocytes against injury in a mimicked diabetic kidney microenvironment by activating M2 macrophages, indicating that Sirt6 can act as an immune response regulatory factor in DN‑associated renal inflammatory injury.","Striatisporolide A, a butenolide metabolite from Athyrium multidentatum (Doll.) Ching, as a potential antibacterial agent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115578,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The present study aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity of striatisporolide A (SA) against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the underlying mechanism. Antibacterial activity was evaluated according to the inhibitory rate and zone of inhibition. The antibacterial mechanism was investigated by analyzing alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity and ATP leakage, protein expression, cell morphology and intracellular alterations in E. coli. The results demonstrated that SA exerted bacteriostatic effects on E. coli in vitro. AKP activity and ATP leakage analysis revealed that SA damaged the cell wall and cell membrane of E. coli. SDS‑PAGE analysis indicated that SA notably altered the level of 10 and 35 kDa proteins. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed marked alterations in the morphology and ultrastructure of E. coli following treatment with SA. The mechanism underlying the antimicrobial effects of SA against E. coli may be attributed to its actions of disrupting the cell membrane and cell wall and regulation of protein level. The findings of the present study provide novel insight into the antimicrobial activity of SA as a potential natural antibacterial agent.",Evaluation of EGFR mutations in NSCLC with highly sensitive droplet digital PCR assays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115577,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Targeted drugs have been widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, particularly for those with non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Plasma cell‑free DNA is an emerging clinical tool for the detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation in patients with lung cancer. Detection of circulating tumor (ct) DNA by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a highly sensitive and minimally invasive alternative for the assessment and management of cancer. In the present study, four ddPCR systems were developed to detect the 19DELs, L858R, T790M and C797S mutations of the EGFR gene in plasma ctDNA samples, and all exhibited higher sensitivity compared with the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)‑PCR assays. The results revealed that the sensitivity of the ddPCR assays for the four major types of EGFR mutant reached 0.04%. In total, 50 plasma ctDNA samples were collected from patients with NSCLC to detect the 19DELs, L858R, T790M and C797S mutations by ddPCR and ARMS‑PCR. All the mutations except for C797S were detected and the concordance rates between ddPCR and ARMS‑PCR were 96% (19DELs), 98% (L858R) and 100% (T790M). The fraction of EGFR mutation ranged from 0.43 to 68.07% using the ddPCR method. Therefore, the present study suggests that the four ddPCR testing systems could be used for early detection of EGFR mutations in plasma samples, so that patients can better select the targeted drugs according to the EGFR mutation.",Silencing of heat shock protein 27 increases the radiosensitivity of non‑small cell lung carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115576,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Radiotherapy is a useful treatment for malignant tumors, including lung carcinoma; however, non‑small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is frequently insensitive to radiation. It has been reported that heat shock protein 27 (HSPB1) is a radioresistance‑associated protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the present study, the role of HSPB1 in NSCLC cells induced by irradiation was investigated. The viability of cells was determined by a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. The apoptotic activity, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of cells were evaluated via flow cytometry. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses were employed to measure the expression of various genes and proteins. It was observed that knockdown of HSPB1 with small interfering RNA (si‑HSPB1) markedly decreased the viability of A549 NSCLC cells and induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase following exposure to 6 Gy irradiation. Furthermore, it was revealed that si‑HSPB1 significantly downregulated cyclin B1 and cyclin G1 expression. Additionally, si‑HSPB1 promoted apoptosis and depolarized the MMP of cells exposed to 6 Gy irradiation. The expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2), mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyto c) and pro‑caspase‑8 were downregulated, whereas those of Bcl‑2 associated X protein (Bax), cytosolic cyto c and cleaved‑caspase‑8 were upregulated. Collectively, silencing of HSPB1 increased the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells by reducing cell viability, depolarizing the MMP, arresting the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and promoting cell apoptosis. Therefore, HSPB1 may be a novel target for increasing radiosensitivity in the treatment of NSCLC.","Downregulation of the long non‑coding RNA FOXD2‑AS1 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115575,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Increasing amounts of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the development of cancer. Recently, aberrant expression of the lncRNA forkhead box D2 adjacent opposite strand RNA1 (FOXD2‑AS1) has been reported to be involved in the progression of several types of human cancer. However, the function and mechanism of FOXD2‑AS1 in osteosarcoma (OS) are currently unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of FOXD2‑AS1 in OS. Firstly, it was revealed that the expression levels of FOXD2‑AS1 were significantly upregulated in OS tissues and cells, compared with in adjacent tissues and normal cells, as determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, the overall survival of patients with relatively high FOXD2‑AS1 expression in OS tissues was significantly lower than that of patients with relatively low expression, as determined using Kaplan‑Meier analysis. In addition, loss‑of‑function experiments were performed in vivo and in vitro to study the biological effects of FOXD2‑AS1. The SOSP‑9607 and U2OS OS cell lines were infected with lentivirus‑mediated FOXD2‑AS1 short hairpin RNA; subsequently, the alterations in cell phenotype and downstream molecules were evaluated. Knockdown of FOXD2‑AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of OS cells. Furthermore, the number of cells in the S phase was significantly decreased, which was consistent with the results of the Cell Counting kit 8 proliferation assay. The expression levels of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase were decreased, as determined by western blotting, following FOXD2‑AS1 knockdown. Finally, in a nude mouse model of tumorigenesis, it was revealed that, when FOXD2‑AS1 expression was downregulated, tumor growth was significantly reduced and pulmonary metastatic nodules were markedly reduced. The results of the present study suggested that decreased FOXD2‑AS1 expression may inhibit the growth, migration and invasion of tumor cells, and it may regulate downstream gene expression. In conclusion, these findings indicated that FOXD2‑AS1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target and early tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of OS.",Crocin protects against dexamethasone‑induced osteoblast apoptosis by inhibiting the ROS/Ca2+‑mediated mitochondrial pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115574,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Osteoblast apoptosis has been identified as an important event in the development of glucocorticoid (GC)‑induced osteoporosis and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Crocin, a bioactive ingredient of saffron, has been demonstrated to induce antiapoptotic effects on numerous types of cell in vitro; however, the effects of crocin on the dexamethasone (Dex)‑induced apoptosis of osteoblasts remain unclear. In the present study, the protective effects of crocin during Dex‑induced apoptosis of MC3T3‑E1 osteoblasts, and the underlying mechanisms, were investigated. MTT and Annexin V‑FITC/PI flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate the viability and apoptosis of cells, respectively. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca2+ levels and apoptosis‑associated protein expression were assessed via flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and western blotting. It was demonstrated that crocin pretreatment inhibited Dex‑induced apoptosis of osteoblasts in a dose‑dependent manner. Crocin reversed Dex‑induced decreases in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increases in ROS and intracellular Ca2+ levels. Furthermore, crocin upregulated the expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl‑2) and mitochondrial cytochrome c (Cyt C), and downregulated those of cleaved caspase‑9, cleaved caspase‑3, Bcl‑2‑associated X protein and cytoplasmic Cyt C. N‑acetylcysteine, a ROS inhibitor, and 1,2‑bis(2‑aminophenoxy)ethane‑N,N,N',N'‑tetraacetic acid, a calcium chelator, attenuated Dex‑induced osteoblast apoptosis, whereas H2O2 and ionomycin, a calcium ionophore that increases intracellular calcium levels, reversed the antiapoptotic effects of crocin on Dex‑treated osteoblasts. These results indicated that crocin may protect osteoblasts from Dex‑induced apoptosis by inhibiting the ROS/Ca2+‑mediated mitochondrial pathway, thus suggesting that crocin has potential value as a treatment for GC‑induced bone diseases.",A 9‑lncRNA risk score system for predicting the prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus‑positive hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115573,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, and can be induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DE‑RNAs were identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage, pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy. A 9‑lncRNA optimal combination [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 9, glucosidase, β, acid 3 (GBA3), HLA complex group 4, N‑acetyltransferase 8B, neighbor of breast cancer 1 gene 2, prostate androgen‑regulated transcript 1, ret finger protein like 1 antisense RNA 1, solute carrier family 22 member 18 antisense and T‑cell leukemia/lymphoma 6] was selected from the 14 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs, and was further supported by the validation dataset, GSE10186. The lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network revealed lncRNA GBA3 as a positive regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2, an important enzyme in the metabolic pathway of gluconeogenesis. A risk score system was established based on the optimal 9 lncRNAs, which may be valuable for predicting the prognosis of patients with HBV‑positive HCC and improving understanding of mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of this disease. On the contrary, a larger, independent cohort of patients is required to further validate the risk‑score system.",A novel mutation associated with Type III Bartter syndrome: A report of five cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115572,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The clinical, biochemical and mutation spectra of Chinese patients with Type III Bartter syndrome (type III BS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, were investigated. A total of five unrelated Chinese patients aged 8 months to 24 years were diagnosed with type III BS via analysis of biochemical markers, including chloride, potassium and calcium, and genetic sequencing. The levels of insulin‑like growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1) were evaluated via ELISA and a mutation study of cultured amniocytes was conducted for prenatal diagnosis. The child patients were admitted for polydipsia, polyuria, myasthenia and developmental delay, whereas the adult patients were hospitalized for limb numbness, polydipsia and polyuria. Nine variants in the chloride voltage‑gated channel Kb (CLCNKB) gene were detected, including eight sequence variants and one whole CLCNKB gene deletion. One sequence variant (c.1967T>C) was novel, whereas the remaining variants (c.595G>T, c.908A>C, c.1004T>C, c.1312C>T, c.1334_1335delCT and c.1718C>A) and the whole gene deletion had been previously reported. The whole gene deletion was frequently observed in patients with early‑onset type III BS in the present study. Two patients showed IGF‑1 deficiency with normal growth hormone level. All patients were treated with potassium supplementation and indometacin. The mother of one patient underwent amniocentesis during her second pregnancy; the fetus was not affected by type III BS based on screening for sequence variants, and normal development and blood electrolyte analysis following birth confirmed the diagnosis. In conclusion, five cases of type III BS in patients from mainland China were reported. Large deletions were frequently detected, particularly in early‑onset patients; isolated IGF‑1 deficiency was found, one novel sequence variant was identified. Prenatal diagnosis was successfully established using genetic analysis of cultured amniocytes, and may facilitate the prevention of congenital defect of type III BS in the next pregnancy.",Formaldehyde induces the apoptosis of BMCs of BALB/c mice via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115571,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified formaldehyde (FA) as a leukemogen to humans in 2012; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor‑suppressor gene and can negatively regulate the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signal transduction pathway, which is associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. To determine the association between FA and the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway, flow cytometry, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis were conducted. Bone marrow cells were obtained from BALB/c mice, divided into the control (untreated cells) and FA groups, which were treated with various doses of FA (50, 100 and 200 µmol/l). Following treatment with FA for 24 h, cell viability, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and the expression of PTEN, PI3K and Akt, as well as the protein expression of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), Bcl‑2‑associated X (Bax), and Caspases‑3 and ‑9 were examined. Furthermore, 10 µmol/PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was applied to inhibit the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway and 100 µmol/l FA was selected for treatment; alteration in the cell cycle were analyzed. The results demonstrated that FA could suppress cell viability, and downregulate PTEN and Bcl‑2; the expression of PI3K, Akt, Bax, and Caspases‑3 and ‑9 were upregulated. Additionally, FA was reported to induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis. Following the application of LY294002 to inhibit the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway, the numbers of cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase were significantly increased in the PI3K inhibitor group compared with the control (P<0.01); however, no significant change in the number of G0/G1 cells compared with FA group was observed (P>0.05). The results of the present study suggested that the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway served an important role in the process of FA‑induced apoptosis, which may be associated with regulating the cell cycle; thus, cell proliferation may be affected.",Establishment and characterization of a novel cell line (cc‑006cpm8) of moderately/poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma derived from a primary tumor of a patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115570,International journal of oncology,2019 06 07,"In the present study, the cc‑006cpm8 novel colon cell line was established from a sample of right colorectal adenocarcinoma obtained from a woman with liver metastasis. It was possible to culture this cell line for ≥100 passages in vitro with vigorous growth. Morphologically, the cells grew as several layers with tight adhesion to the surface of the culture plate. The morphological, immunological and ultrastructural features of these cells suggested their epithelial origin. The characterization of this cell line indicated a doubling time of 27 h, a colony forming efficiency of 73.2% in semisolid media and a plate efficiency of 66.5% in liquid culture. The modal number of chromosomes was 50. In vivo, the cc‑006cpm8 cells underwent tumorigenesis in all nude mice used. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that mutS homolog 2 (MSH2) and MSH6 were expressed; however, mutL homolog 1 and postmeiotic segregation 2 were downregulated in cc‑006cpm8 cells. To determine the mutation profile of the cell line analyzed, exome capture DNA sequencing was performed. The results revealed 20 hypermutated exons comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms, and insertion and deletions (InDels), including single nucleotide variants of mucin (MUC)19, MUC16, MUC12, filaggrin and AHNAK nucleoprotein 2, and InDels of β defensin‑126, microRNA‑3665, WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1 and SLAIN motif‑containing protein 1. In addition, commonly mutated genes in colorectal cancer and exon mutations of genes in cc‑006cpm8 cells were analyzed, including adenomatous polyposis coli, tumor protein p53, Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic 4, phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit α and Kirsten rat sarcoma, and genes associated with the DNA mismatch repair pathway were investigated."

Distant metastasis is a key cause of CRC‑associated mortality. MEIS2 has been identified to be dysregulated in several types of human cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulatory role of MEIS2 in CRC metastasis remain largely unknown. For the first time, the present study demonstrated that MEIS2 serves a role as a promoter of metastasis in CRC. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that knockdown of MEIS2 significantly suppressed CRC migration, invasion and the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, microarray and bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of MEIS2 in the regulation of CRC metastasis. Additionally, it was identified that a high expression of MEIS2 was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival time for patients with CRC. The present study demonstrated that MEIS2 may serve as a novel biomarker for CRC.",Intratumoral injection of dendritic cells overexpressing interleukin‑12 inhibits melanoma growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115558,Oncology reports,2019 06 07,"The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor effects of an intratumoral injection of dendritic cells (DCs) overexpressing interleukin-12 (IL‑12) on melanoma. DCs, isolated from mouse spleen, were gene‑modified using an IL‑12 overexpression vector. Melanoma B6 cells were injected into C57BL/6 mice to generate tumors. Thereafter, DCs overexpressing IL‑12 were injected into the tumors, and tumor volume was subsequently measured. Pathological changes in tumor tissue were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of interleukin-4 (IL‑4) and IL‑12 in tumors was measured by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay, real‑time PCR and western blotting. DCs were successfully isolated and a lentivirus vector expressing IL‑12 was constructed. After intratumoral injection of phosphate‑buffered saline (control group), tumor cells exhibited malignant growth; whereas tumors injected with DCs (DC group) or DCs + empty vector (DC + vector group) exhibited a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration and limited areas of tissue necrosis. In contrast, tumors injected with DCs overexpressing IL‑12 (DC + IL‑12 group) displayed severe tissue necrosis, loss of cell structure, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Compared with the control group, the tumor volumes were significantly lower in the DC, the DC + vector and the DC + IL‑12 groups, while the expression of IL‑12 and IL‑4 in the tumors was significantly higher. Importantly, the most marked changes in tumor volume and IL‑12 and IL‑4 expression were in the DC + IL‑12 group, which were significantly greater than those in tumors treated with unmodified DCs. Hence, intratumoral injection of DCs overexpressing IL‑12 exerted strong antitumor effects in melanoma, and biotherapy with DCs overexpressing IL‑12 is a potential treatment strategy for melanoma.",iTRAQ‑based proteomic analysis of endotoxin tolerance induced by lipopolysaccharide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115557,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differentially expressed proteins between endotoxin tolerance and sepsis. Cell models of an endotoxin tolerance group (ET group) and sepsis group [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group] were established using LPS and evaluated using ELISA and flow cytometry methods. Differentially expressed proteins between the ET and the LPS groups were identified using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis and evaluated by bioinformatics analysis. The expression of core proteins was detected by western blotting. It was identified that the expression of tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6 was significantly decreased in the ET group compared with the LPS group. Following high‑dose LPS stimulation for 24 h, the positive rate of cluster of differentiation‑16/32 in the ET group (79.07%) was lower when compared with that of the LPS group (94.27%; P<0.05). A total of 235 proteins were identified by iTRAQ, and 36 upregulated proteins with >1.2‑fold differences and 27 downregulated proteins with <0.833‑fold differences were detected between the ET and LPS groups. Furthermore, the expression of high mobility group (HMG)‑A1 and HMGA2 in the ET group was higher compared with the LPS group following high‑dose LPS stimulation for 4 h, while HMGB1 and HMGB2 exhibited the opposite expression trend under the same conditions. In conclusion, proteomics analysis using iTRAQ technology contributes to a deeper understanding of ET mechanisms. HMGA1, HMGA2, HMGB1 and HMGB2 may serve a crucial role in the development of ET.",MicroRNA‑21 contributes to the puerarin‑induced cardioprotection via suppression of apoptosis and oxidative stress in a cell model of ischemia/reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115556,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Puerarin, a major bioactive constituent of the Radix puerariae, can ameliorate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Emerging evidence supports that microRNA (miR)‑21 functions as a protective factor against I/R and/or hypoxia‑reperfusion (H/R)‑induced myocardial injury. However, the role of miR‑21 in the cardioprotective effect of puerarin remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the involvement of miR‑21 in the cardioprotective mechanisms of puerarin using a cell model of I/R injury, generated by culturing rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes under H/R conditions. The results demonstrated that pre‑treatment with puerarin significantly increased cell viability, decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and upregulated miR‑21 expression in H/R‑treated H9c2 cells. Transfection of an miR‑21 inhibitor led to an increase in H/R‑induced cytotoxicity and reversed the protective effects of puerarin. Additionally, miR‑21 inhibition attenuated the puerarin‑induced decrease in the rate of apoptosis, caspase‑3 activity and the expression of apoptosis regulator Bax, and increased apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2 expression, under H/R conditions. Furthermore, puerarin mitigated H/R‑induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the decrease in endogenous reactive oxygen species production, malondialdehyde content and NADPH oxidase 2 expression, and enhanced the antioxidative defense system as illustrated by the increase in superoxide dismutase activity, catalase and glutathione peroxidase levels. These effects were all eliminated by miR‑21 inhibitor transfection. Furthermore, the miR‑21 inhibitor exacerbated the H/R‑induced oxidative stress and attenuated the antioxidative defense system in H/R‑treated H9c2 cells. Taken together, the results suggested that miR‑21 mediated the cardioprotective effects of puerarin against myocardial H/R injury by inhibiting apoptosis and oxidative stress.",Small RNA sequencing revealed aberrant piRNA expression profiles in colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115555,Oncology reports,2019 06 07,"Piwi‑interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a novel class of non‑coding RNAs, are enriched in germ cells and implicated in spermatogenesis. Emerging evidence demonstrated deregulated expression of piRNAs in numerous tumor types. However, changes in piRNA expression profiles in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not yet been investigated. In the present study, small RNA sequencing was used to evaluate the differences in piRNA expression profiles between CRC and adjacent non‑tumor tissues, as well as to screen for differentially expressed piRNAs. The present results demonstrated that the percentage of unique piRNA reads had no notable difference between the paired CRC and adjacent non‑tumor samples (0.12% vs. 0.13%); however, the counts of total piRNA reads in CRC samples were increased, compared with those in adjacent non‑tumor samples (0.15% vs. 0.07%). Differential expression analysis identified 33 upregulated piRNAs and 2 downregulated piRNAs in CRC samples, among which piR‑18849, piR‑19521 and piR‑17724 were the top three upregulated piRNAs. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that the expression levels of piR‑18849, piR‑19521 and piR‑17724 were increased in 80 CRC tissues, compared with paired adjacent non‑tumor tissues. Furthermore, the high expression of piR‑18849 and piR‑19521 was associated with a poor degree of differentiation. The increased expression of piR‑18849 was also associated with high lymph node metastasis. However, no associations were determined between piR‑17724 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of patients. In summary, the present study is the first to provide an overview of the changes in piRNA expression patterns in CRC, shedding new light on the regulatory roles of piRNAs in colorectal carcinogenesis. piR‑18849 and piR‑19521 may be prognostic biomarkers for patients with CRC.",Annexin A2 regulates glioma cell proliferation through the STAT3‑cyclin D1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115554,Oncology reports,2019 06 07,"Annexin A2 (ANXA2) acts as a calcium‑dependent phospholipid‑binding protein that is widely expressed in vertebrate cells and has abnormally high expression in various tumor cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the effects of ANXA2 on glioma cells remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of ANXA2 in glioma cell proliferation. The results revealed that knockdown of ANXA2 inhibited the proliferation of U251 and U87 glioma cell lines and decreased phosphorylated (p) signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)(Y705) and cyclin D1 expression, leading to impedance of the G1‑to‑S phase transition. Furthermore, it was suggested that ANXA2 may regulate pSTAT3(Y705) levels through direct binding with STAT3, thereby affecting STAT3‑cyclin D1 pathway‑mediated cell proliferation. When ANXA2 was re‑expressed in ANXA2‑knockdown cells, the expression of pSTAT3(Y705) and cyclin D1 was restored. Furthermore, overexpression of ANXA2 significantly promoted the proliferation of U251 cells, as determined by an MTT assay and a tumor formation assay in nude mice, but had no statistically significant effect on colony formation rate, cell cycle progression or the STAT3‑cyclin D1 pathway, suggesting that endogenous ANXA2 may be redundant. Additionally, the present study provided evidence that the overexpression of ANXA2 enhanced the expression of pSTAT3(Y705) in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), indicating that the proliferation‑promoting effect of ANXA2 may be due to the accumulation and synergistic effect of paracrine EGF. Taken together, the present results indicated that ANXA2 may affect the proliferation of human glioma cells through the STAT3‑cyclin D1 pathway via direct interaction with STAT3 in U251 and U87 glioma cells. ANXA2 was redundant in this pathway, but positive synergy was revealed to exist between ANXA2 and EGF.","Identification of claudin‑1, ‑3, ‑7 and ‑8 as prognostic markers in human laryngeal carcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115553,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Various genomic and epigenetic modifications that occur during the development of cancer act as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated abnormal expression of the claudin (CLDN) tight junction (TJ) proteins in numerous types of human cancer. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were employed to investigate variations in the expression of the CLDN TJ proteins in laryngeal non‑neoplastic tissues and laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissues. It was revealed that CLDN2, CLDN4, CLDN5, CLDN6, CLDN9, CLDN11 and CLDN12 were undetectable in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissues and laryngeal non‑neoplastic tissues. Additionally, CLDN10 was expressed in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissues and laryngeal non‑neoplastic tissues; however, no significant difference was reported. Conversely, the expression levels of CLDN1 and CLDN7 mRNA and protein were downregulated in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissues compared with in adjacent non‑neoplastic tissues, whereas those of CLDN3 and CLDN8 were upregulated. A total of 80 samples of laryngeal squamous carcinoma and non‑neoplastic tissues were analyzed for the expression of CLDN1, ‑3, ‑7 and ‑8 via streptavidin‑peroxidase immunohistochemical staining. It was revealed that the expression levels of CLDN1 and CLDN7 were downregulated in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissues compared with in non‑neoplastic mucosal tissues, whereas those of CLDN3 and CLDN8 were upregulated. Furthermore, the associations between CLDN expression and the clinicopathological factors of patients were analyzed. The expression levels of CLDN3 and CLDN7 were reported to be associated with distant metastasis and serve as potential predictors of poor prognosis. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrated that the expression levels of CLDN1, ‑3, ‑7 and ‑8 varied between laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissues and non‑neoplastic tissues. The expression levels of these CLDNs may be useful molecular markers for the diagnosis of laryngeal carcinoma, and determining the metastasis and prognosis of this disease.",Association of nutraceutical supplements with longer telomere length.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115552,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"Telomeres are nucleotide tandem repeats located at the tip of eukaryotic chromosomes that maintain genomic integrity. The gradual shortening of telomeres leads to cellular senescence and apoptosis, a key mechanism of aging and age‑related chronic diseases. Epigenetic factors, such as nutrition, exercise and tobacco can affect the rate at which telomeres shorten and can modify the risk of developing chronic diseases. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a combination of nutraceutical supplements (NS) on telomere length (TL) in healthy volunteers with no medical history of any disease. Participants (n=47) were selected from healthy outpatients visiting a private clinic and were divided into the experimental group (n=16), that received the NS and the control group (n=31). We estimated the length of single telomeres in metaphase spread leukocytes, isolated from peripheral blood, using quantitative‑fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q‑FISH) analysis. The length of the whole telomere genome was significantly increased (P<0.05) for the mean, 1st quartile and median measurements in the experimental group. Similar findings were observed for short TL (20th percentile) (P<0.05) for the median and 3rd quartile measurements in the NS group, compared to the control group. The beneficial effects of the supplements on the length of short telomeres remained significant (P<0.05) following adjustment for age and sex. Telomeres were moderately longer in female patients compared to the male patients. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that the administration of NS may be linked to sustaining the TL.",Glycyrrhizin protects human melanocytes from H2O2‑induced oxidative damage via the Nrf2‑dependent induction of HO‑1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115551,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"Oxidative stress serves a critical role in melanocyte death and is considered to be a major cause of vitiligo. The nuclear factor E2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway has an important role in the antioxidative stress mechanisms of melanocytes. Glycyrrhizin (GR) is a derivative of herbal medicines used to treat hepatitis and allergic disease due to its antiviral and anti‑allergy effects. GR also activates Nrf2 and induces the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)‑1 in macrophages. Whether GR can protect human melanocytes from oxidative stress remains unknown. The present study investigated the potential protective effects of GR against oxidative stress in human melanocytes and the mechanisms involved. Following exposure to 0.5 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), human primary melanocytes were treated with 1 mM GR. Cell viability was determined using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay, and apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. GR treatment significantly improved cell viability, reduced the apoptotic rate of melanocytes and reduced the level of reactive oxygen species in human melanocytes. Furthermore, GR induced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and induced the expression of HO‑1 in melanocytes. The knockdown of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA or the inhibition of HO‑1 by ZnPP reversed the protective effect of GR on melanocytes against H2O2‑induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These data demonstrate that GR protects human melanocytes from H2O2‑induced oxidative damage via the Nrf2‑dependent induction of HO‑1, providing evidence for the application of GR in the treatment of vitiligo.",Differential gene methylation patterns in cancerous and non‑cancerous cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115550,Oncology reports,2019 06 11,"Large‑scale projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Epigenome Project (HEP) and Human Epigenome Atlas (HEA), provide an insight into DNA methylation and histone modification markers. Changes in the epigenome significantly contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. The goal of the present study was to characterize the prostate cancer malignant transformation model using the CpG island methylation pattern. The Human Prostate Cancer EpiTect Methyl II Signature PCR Array was used to evaluate the methylation status of 22 genes in prostate cancer cell lines: PC3, PC3M, PC3MPro4 and PC3MLN4, each representing different metastatic potential in vivo. Subsequently, it was ascertained whether DNA methylation plays a role in the expression of these genes in prostate cancer cells. Hypermethylation of APC, DKK3, GPX3, GSTP1, MGMT, PTGS2, RASSF1, TIMP2 and TNFRSF10D resulted in downregulation of their expression in prostate cancer cell lines as compared to WT fibroblasts. Mining of the TCGA data deposited in the MetHC database found increases in the methylation status of these 9 genes in prostate cancer patients, further supporting the role of methylation in altering the expression of these genes in prostate cancer. Future studies are warranted to investigate the role of these proteins in prostate cancer development."

Accumulating evidence indicates that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play important roles in NSOC; however, the potential regulatory associations between them remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed next‑generation RNA sequencing (RNA‑seq) to identify transcriptome profiles, including mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs, in patients with CL/P and CPO. A total of 36 lncRNAs, 1,341 mRNAs and 60 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the CL/P group compared to the control group, and 57 lncRNAs, 1,255 mRNAs and 162 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the CPO group compared to the control group. Subsequently, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed to validate the expression of selected lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs. In addition, bioinformatics methods were employed to explore the potential functions of ncRNAs and to construct lncRNA‑miRNA‑mRNA regulatory networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze regulated non‑coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in CL/P and CPO, providing a novel perspective on the etiology of NSOC and laying the foundation for future research into the potential regulatory mechanisms of ncRNAs and mRNAs in NSOC.",Substance P enhances BMSC osteogenic differentiation via autophagic activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115537,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are the most commonly investigated progenitor cells in bone tissue engineering for treating severe bone defects. Strategies for regulating BMSC differentiation fate have received wide attention, in which redox homeostasis plays an important role due to the change in energy metabolism during stem cell differentiation. In the present study, it was observed that autophagic activity was induced along with BMSC osteogenic differentiation and subsequently regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the level of osteogenesis. Furthermore, it was also observed that neuropeptide substance P (SP) administration could enhance the autophagic activity in rat BMSCs via the AMPK and mTOR pathways, as well as decreasing ROS generation and promoting osteogenic differentiation. Inhibition of autophagic activity by 3‑MA reversed the effects of SP on ROS and osteogenic levels. The present results indicated that autophagic activity participated in the regulation of differentiation fate of BMSCs and SP could promote osteogenic differentiation by activating autophagy, providing a more precise biological mechanism for its application in bone tissue engineering.",Bioinformatics‑based identification of key pathways and candidate genes for estrogen‑induced intrahepatic cholestasis using DNA microarray analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115536,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Estrogen‑induced intrahepatic cholestasis (EIC) has increased incidence during pregnancy, and within women taking oral contraception and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. However, the pathology underlying EIC is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to identify key pathways and candidate genes in estrogen‑induced intrahepatic cholestasis (EIC) that may be potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. A whole‑genome microarray (4x44K) analysis of a 17α‑ethinylestradiol (EE)‑induced EIC rat liver model was performed. Bioinformatics‑based methods were used to identify key pathways and candidate genes associated with EIC. The candidate genes were validated using a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. A total of 455 genes were differentially expressed (P<0.05 and fold change >2.0) following EE treatment, including 225 downregulated genes and 230 upregulated genes. Sulfotransferase family 1E member 1, cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 2, carbonic anhydrase 3, leukotriene C4 synthase and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 8 were the 5 candidate genes identified to be differentially expressed and involved in the metabolism of estrogens and bile acids and the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress. The Analyses of Gene Ontology enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and protein‑protein interaction network associated‑modules identified several key pathways involved in the homeostasis of lipids and bile acids and in AMPK, p53 and Wnt signaling. These key pathways and candidate genes may have critical roles in the pathogenesis of EIC. In addition, reversing the abnormal expression of candidate genes or restoring the dysfunction of key pathways may provide therapeutic opportunities for patients with EIC.",Saikosaponin‑D improves fear memory deficits in ovariectomized rats via the action of estrogen receptor‑α in the hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115535,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Saikosaponin‑D (SSD), which is the main bioactive component in the traditional Chinese medicine Chai Hu (Bupleurum falcatum L), possesses estrogen‑like properties and is widely used in treating estrogen‑related neurological disorders. The current study aimed to investigate the protective effects of SSD on the fear memory deficit in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and the potential underlying mechanism. SSD treatment significantly prolonged freezing time in OVX rats in a manner similar to that of estradiol (E2), whereas this effect was markedly suppressed by co‑administration of ICI182780, a non‑selective estrogen receptor (ER) inhibitor. The expression of ERα in the hippocampus of OVX rats was significantly elevated by SSD; however, Erβ expression and E2 synthesis were not markedly affected by SSD treatment. Collectively, this study demonstrated that SSD‑mediated fear memory improvement in OVX rats may be attributed not to E2 levels or ERβ activity, but to ERα activation in the hippocampus.","miR‑10b‑3p, miR‑8112 and let‑7j as potential biomarkers for autoimmune inner ear diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115534,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested as non‑invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of several autoimmune diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have yet examined the miRNA expression profiles in autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). The present study aimed to use an miRNA sequencing assay to detect the miRNA expression profiles of serum samples from 3 control mice and 3 antigen‑induced AIED model mice. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE‑miRNAs) were screened using a t‑test. miRNA target prediction was performed using TargetScan Mouse. Then, the miRNA‑target gene interaction network was constructed and visualized using Cytoscape software. The underlying functions of the target genes of the DE‑miRNAs were predicted using the clusterProfiler package. As a result, 22 miRNAs were identified as DE‑miRNAs between AIED and control mice, including 10 upregulated and 12 downregulated genes. Based on the TargetScan Mouse prediction, 1,958 genes were identified as the targets for the 22 DE‑miRNAs. Functional analysis indicated that only the target genes of 8 miRNAs were respectively enriched for Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, among which miR‑10b‑3p, let‑7j and miR‑8112 were shared between the two pathway analyses. These 3 miRNAs may be involved in AIED by affecting inflammatory chemokine (miR‑10b‑3p‑C‑C motif chemokine 12), Wnt signaling (miR‑8112‑Wnt9b/Wnt 3a/Wnt2b) and Mucin type O‑glycan biosynthesis pathways (let‑7j‑Galnt2/Galnt12). In conclusion, miR‑10b‑3p, miR‑8112 and let‑7j may be underlying biomarkers for diagnosing AIED.",TFAP2E methylation promotes 5‑fluorouracil resistance via exosomal miR‑106a‑5p and miR‑421 in gastric cancer MGC‑803 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115533,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Hypermethylation of transcription factor activating enhancer‑binding protein 2e (TFAP2E) has been reported to be associated with chemoresistance to 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU) in gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, the molecular mechanism governing this chemoresistance was investigated. Drug‑resistant human GC MGC‑803/5‑FU cells were established and TFAP2E expression and methylation levels were assessed. Autocrine exosomes from GC culture medium were isolated and characterized. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis was used to determine the miRNA expression profile of GC cell‑derived exosomes. Exosomes collected from MGC‑803/5‑FU cells were co‑cultured with control cells, and 5‑Aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (5Aza) was added into MGC‑803/5‑FU cells to investigate the relationship between TFAP2E, exosomes and chemosensitivity. In the present study, it was demonstrated that hypermethylation of TFAP2E resulted in its reduced expression and 5‑FU chemoresistance in GC cells. miRNAs miR‑106a‑5p and miR‑421 were highly expressed and regulated the chemoresistance induced by TFAP2E methylation. Target gene prediction using miRBase, TargetScan and PicTar revealed that E2F1, MTOR and STAT3 may be TFAP2E target genes in GC. Collectively, our data support an important role of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs in TFAP2E methylation‑induced chemoresistance to 5‑FU in GC. These results highlight their potential for miRNA‑based therapeutics.",Bioinformatics identification of microRNAs involved in polycystic ovary syndrome based on microarray data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115532,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disease in women of reproductive age. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) serve important roles in the physiological and pathological process of PCOS. To identify PCOS‑associated miRNAs, the dataset GSE84376 was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE‑miRNAs) were obtained from Gene‑Cloud Biotechnology Information and potential target genes were predicted using TargetScan, DIANA‑microT‑CDS, miRDB and miRTarBase tools. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape and a protein‑protein interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Transcription factors were obtained from FunRich. DE‑miRNAs were verified by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. At the screening phase, there were seven DE‑miRNAs in the PCOS group not present in the control group. In total, 935 target genes were identified, which are involved in the development and maturation of oocytes. Mitogen‑activated protein kinase 1, phosphatase and tensin homolog, cAMP responsive element binding protein 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, interferon γ, Fms‑related tyrosine kinase 1, transcription factor p65, insulin receptor substrate 1, DnaJ homolog superfamily C member 10 and casein kinase 2 α 1 were identified as the top 10 hub genes in the protein‑protein interaction network. Specificity protein 1 was the most enriched transcription factor. At the validation phase, the levels of Homo sapiens (hsa)‑miR‑3188 and hsa‑miR‑3135b were significantly higher in the PCOS group than in the control group. In addition, the expression level of hsa‑miR‑3135b was significantly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved, the fertilization rate and the cleavage rate (P<0.05). The present bioinformatics study on miRNAs may offer a novel understanding of the mechanism of PCOS, and may serve to identify novel miRNA therapeutic targets.","Administration of live, but not inactivated, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has a preventive effect on dextran sodium sulfate‑induced colitis in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115531,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is one of the most abundant bacteria in the human gut microbiota. This bacterium is reported to serve an important role in inflammatory bowel diseases. In the present study, the preventive effects of F. prausnitzii on a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)‑induced colitis model in mice were investigated. BALB/c mice were fed with 5% DSS in drinking water. Administration of live or inactivated F. prausnitzii was initiated 7 days prior to the start of DSS feeding. Mucosal cytokines were analyzed by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Histological analysis of colon mucosa was also performed. The symptoms of DSS‑induced colitis (weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stools and colon shortening) were significantly improved in the group administered live F. prausnitzii, but not in the other groups. There were no significant differences in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines; however, the expression of mucosal cytokines appeared to be markedly reduced in the live F. prausnitzii‑administered group compared with the DSS‑fed control. The results suggested that preventive administration of 'live', but not inactivated, F. prausnitzii protected the colon against DSS‑induced colitis. Live F. prausnitzii were also administered therapeutically following the induction of colitis, resulting in an improved histological score in mice.",FGF signaling contributes to atherosclerosis by enhancing the inflammatory response in vascular smooth muscle cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115530,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The contractile to synthetic phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has been previously described. However, the role of the inflammatory response induced by FGF signaling in VSMCs and its occurrence in atherosclerosis remains unclear. In the present study, FGF signaling promoted a contractile to secretory phenotypic transition in VSMCs. VSMCs (primary human aortic smooth muscle cells) treated with FGF exhibited a decrease in the protein expression levels of factors involved in contractility and the secretion of various chemokines was increased, as assessed by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and ELISA. Additionally, inhibition of FGF signaling by silencing FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) decreased the protein expression levels of various chemokines. Furthermore, VSMCs in the medial layers of arteries from apolipoprotein E‑deficient mice and human atherosclerotic samples exhibited an increase in FGF signaling that was identified to be associated with an increase in the protein expression levels of pro‑inflammatory molecules, including C‑C motif chemokine ligand 2, C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, compared with wild‑type mice and healthy control samples, respectively. The present results suggested that FGF signaling induced dedifferentiation of contractile VSMCs and the transition to a secretory phenotype, which may be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Collectively, the present results suggested that the FGF signaling pathway may represent a novel target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",Possibility of early diagnosis in a fetus affected by Prader‑Willi syndrome with maternal hetero‑UPD15: A lesson to be learned.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115529,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Prader‑Willi syndrome (PWS), a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder arising from errors in genomic imprinting, is characterized by evident hypotonia along with feeding difficulties and the absence of crying in early infancy. Hyperphagia and obesity are not uncommon in patients with PWS, usually accompanied by intellectual disability, cognitive impairment, short stature, small hands and feet, as well as hypogonadism and typical facial features. Due to the severe complications associated with PWS, a thorough understanding of its features and an early diagnosis, preferably in the fetal period, are important for clinical management. According to previous studies, prenatal diagnosis has been confirmed in only a few cases of PWS, using ultrasound, or as an accidental finding by cytogenetic molecular techniques, as no precise fetal phenotype has been defined. In this present study, an infant with PWS arising from maternal heterodisomy of chromosome 15 is described. This is a typical case of missed diagnosis by fetal ultrasound examination, chromosome karyotype analysis and chromosome microarray (CMA) conducted during the pregnancy. To delineate the complex prenatal characteristics of a fetus with PWS, prenatally‑diagnosed cases of PWS described in the literature were reviewed. This present study indicated that although prenatal signs are not sufficient for a diagnosis to be confirmed, a comprehensive consideration of these signs is important in leading to a diagnosis of suspected PWS, and thus prompts further prenatal investigations using molecular genetic tools. Furthermore, this present study also suggested that CMA can lead to a missed diagnosis of PWS/Angelman syndrome and other imprinting disorders despite its high value in the detection of copy‑number variants in individuals with developmental delay. If clinical signs strongly suggest PWS, other prenatal molecular genetic investigations, including methylation tests and short tandem repeat‑based linkage analysis for uniparental disomy, are recommended as an additional tool to aid diagnosis."

In the present study, 2‑ and 3‑dimensional pressure‑loading systems were used to exert pressure on HepG2 and Huh‑7 cell lines. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry analyses were undertaken to observe the proliferative ability of pressure‑loaded cells. In addition, Transwell, wound‑healing and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assays were applied to evaluate the migratory and invasive ability of pressurized cells. Analyses of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression profiles were performed to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, which were validated by RT‑qPCR. Bioinformatics analyses were subsequently performed to investigate the putative target genes and associated pathways. The proliferation and invasion of HepG2 and Huh‑7 cell lines were significantly increased under a pressure of 15 mmHg for 24 h. Under this condition, five differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change ≥1.2, P≤0.05) and 10,150 differentially expressed mRNAs (fold change ≥2, P≤0.05) were identified. A total of 1,309 genes were identified from the integrative analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs. In addition, the bioinformatics analyses revealed that the majority of these miRNAs and mRNAs were associated with several pathways associated with cell proliferation and invasion, including 'PI3K/Akt signaling pathway', 'focal adhesion', 'integrin‑mediated signaling pathway', 'FOXO signaling pathway' and 'Hippo signaling pathway'. The present study described the pressure‑dependent proliferation and invasion of liver cancer cells, and revealed the potential molecular mechanisms underlying them. The identification of miRNAs and their putative targets may also result in novel treatment strategies for liver cancer.",Toosendanin induces the apoptosis of human Ewing's sarcoma cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115517,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Toosendanin, a triterpenoid extracted from the root bark of Melia toosendan, has its origin from traditional Chinese medicine and has been used as a non‑polluting and pesticide‑free plant insecticide in China for fruit and vegetable production. In recent years, toosendanin has been found to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote tumor cell apoptosis. Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is the second most common primary malignant bone and soft tissue tumor in children and adolescents. Although the overall prognosis of ES has improved, the 5‑year survival rate has not significantly increased. To analyze the role of toosendanin on ES progression, CCK‑8 viability assay, flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining and western blotting were performed. The present results suggested that toosendanin suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis in human SK‑ES‑1 cells compared with DMSO treatment. In addition, in the present study, toosendanin was found to upregulate the expression of Bax and downregulate the expression of Bcl‑2, altering the Bax/Bcl‑2 ratio. Additionally, toosendanin promoted the release of cytochrome c, resulting in the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, thus inducing the activation of caspase‑9 and caspase‑3, and the cleavage of PARP. Our results demonstrated that toosendanin inhibited the growth of ES cells in a dose‑dependent manner and triggered mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to induce apoptosis. Therefore, toosendanin can potentially be utilized as an anticancer botanical drug for the treatment of ES.",Fr‑HMGB1 and ds‑HMGB1 activate the kynurenine pathway via different mechanisms in association with depressive‑like behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115516,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Our previous study reported that fully reduced high mobility group box 1 (fr‑HMGB1) and disulfide HMGB1 (ds‑HMGB1) induce depressive‑like behavior; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the induction of depression via the kynurenine pathway by different redox states of HMGB1 was investigated in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate the expression of enzymes of the kynurenine pathway, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were conducted. Additionally, cytokine levels were measured by ELISAs. Following intracerebroventricular injection of ds‑ and fr‑HMGB1, behavioral tests were performed, revealing the presentation of depressive‑like behavior, and essential proteins in the kynurenine pathway were demonstrated to be upregulated at the mRNA level, suggesting that ds‑ and fr‑HMGB1 contributed to the development of this behavior via the kynurenine pathway. ds‑HMGB1 directly activated the kynurenine pathway and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) and interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) in the hippocampal tissue. Conversely, fr‑HMGB1 upregulated the aforementioned factors only following treatment with H2O2. These findings indicated that ds‑HMGB1 induced depression in a manner associated with the kynurenine pathway, whereas oxidation of fr‑HMGB1 evoked activation of the kynurenine pathway, resulting in depressive behavior.",The protective effect of the TUG1/miR‑197/MAPK1 axis on lipopolysaccharide‑induced podocyte injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115515,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The podocyte, a type of glomerular epithelial cell, is the key constituent of the filtration barrier layer in the kidney. Previous studies have shown that long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA)‑taurine‑upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) served a protective role in diabetes‑induced podocyte damage. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of TUG1 in the progress of podocyte injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and explore the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that TUG1 expression was suppressed in LPS‑induced podocytes. Enhanced TUG1 expression by exogenous recombinant vector regulated the expression of podocyte associated proteins [Nephrin, Podocin and CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein (CHOP)]. A marked decrease was observed in the level the albumin influx in cells transfected with TUG1. Further study indicated that microRNA (miR)‑197 is a potential target of TUG1. The enhanced level of miR‑197 induced by LPS was inhibited in cells transfected with TUG1. The decreased Nephrin and Podocin expression, upregulated CHOP expression and the increased albumin influx were slightly enhanced by miR‑197 mimic transfection, while markedly suppressed by miR‑197 inhibitor transfection in LPS‑induced podocytes. Mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein was predicted as a potential target of miR‑197. The downregulated expression of phosphorylated‑MAPK/MAPK induced by LPS was significantly suppressed by TUG1 transfection in podocytes. In addition to this, autophagy was promoted by TUG1 transfection via the elevation of the Beclin1 and light chain (LC)3 II/LC3 I levels, and suppressing p62 expression. However, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 reversed the changes that TUG1 induced in the levels of Beclin1, LC3 II/LC3 I and p62. Taken together, these results demonstrated that LPS‑induced podocyte injury could be alleviated by the TUG1/miR‑197/MAPK1 axis.",Long non‑coding RNA FER1L4 inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis through regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115514,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Lung cancer is among the most common malignancies worldwide; however, the current understanding of its detailed mechanism remains limited. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were previously identified to serve significant roles in tumorigenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the role of a novel lncRNA, Fer‑1‑like family member 4 (FER1L4), in lung tumorigenesis. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the expression level of FER1L4 was significantly decreased in clinical lung cancer tissues and in cultured lung cancer cells, as evidenced by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Overexpression of FER1L4 in lung cancer cell lines A549 and 95D inhibited colony formation, cell proliferation and cell migration capacity, measured by colony formation assays, cell proliferation assays and Transwell assays, respectively. Overexpression of FER1L4 led to a reduction in the expression levels of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) in A549 and 95D cells, whereas, activation of PI3K/Akt signaling using a small molecular inhibitor of phosphatase and tensin homolog, reversed the inhibitory effects of FER1L4 on cell proliferation and metastasis. All of these results suggested that the lncRNA FER1L4 suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in lung cancer.",Leptin stimulates the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and pro‑angiogenic capability of cholangiocarcinoma cells through the miR‑122/PKM2 axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115511,International journal of oncology,2019 06 07,"Leptin is an adipokine minimally known for its activities or underlying mechanisms in cholangiocarcinoma. The present study explored the effects of leptin on the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and pro‑angiogenic capability of cholangiocarcinoma cells, and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with leptin, and their migration and invasion rates were investigated using Transwell assays. Furthermore, conditioned medium was collected from cholangiocarcinoma cells following leptin treatment and applied to human umbilical vein endothelial cells to assess tube formation. The expression of EMT and pro‑angiogenic factors was examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analyses. Mechanistically, the function of pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) was assessed in leptin‑induced phenotypes using siRNA targeting PKM2 (si‑PKM2). Bioinformatics screening and luciferase reporter assays were used to reveal microRNA (miR)‑122 as the potential mediator between leptin and PKM2. Finally, the associations between leptin and miR‑122 or PKM2 levels in patients with cholangiocarcinoma were assessed by ELISA and RT‑qPCR. Leptin significantly increased the EMT and pro‑angiogenic capability of cholangiocarcinoma cells, visibly inhibited endogenous miR‑122 expression, and upregulated PKM2. Furthermore, si‑PKM2 inhibited leptin‑induced migration, invasion, EMT‑associated marker expression levels and the pro‑angiogenic capability in cholangiocarcinoma cells. In addition, miR‑122 negatively regulated the expression of PKM2. When applied together with leptin, miR‑122 was sufficient to reverse the multiple malignancy‑promoting effects of leptin. Consistently, the serum leptin level positively correlated with that of PKM2, but negatively with that of miR‑122 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Leptin, by downregulating miR‑122 and elevating PKM2 expression, acts as a pleiotropic pro‑malignancy cytokine for cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, increasing miR‑122 expression and inhibiting PKM2 may be future approaches for cholangiocarcinoma treatment.","The profibrotic effect of downregulated Na,K‑ATPase β1 subunit in alveolar epithelial cells during lung fibrosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115510,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 07,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive lung scarring and excessive extracellular matrix depositon. When stimulated, alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are aberrantly activated, the expression of profibrotic molecules is enhanced, and lung fibrosis is promoted, but the mechanism for this is unclear. It has been reported that a downregulation of the Na,K‑ATPase β1 subunit in renal epithelial cells is involved in renal fibrosis development, but the role of this protein in lung fibrosis remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of the Na,K‑ATPase β1 subunit was revealed to be markedly decreased in AECs of patients with IPF and a bleomycin‑induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. Treatment with transforming growth factor β‑1 led to significantly downregulation of the Na,K‑ATPase β1 subunit in lung adenocarcioma A549 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of the Na,K‑ATPase β1 subunit in A549 cells resulted in the upregulation of profibrotic molecules, activation of the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. These findings reveal that the downregulation of the Na,K‑ATPase β1 subunit enhances the expression of profibrotic molecules in AECs and may contribute to IPF pathogenesis.",Neuregulin‑1 impacting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell migration is conducive to functional recovery following spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115509,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"The present study was designed to investigate the effect of neuregulin‑1 (NRG1) on the migration of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and evaluate the role of NRG1 in the functional recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Firstly, the effect of NRG1 on the mRNA expression of Snail in the BMSCs was detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) analysis; secondly, the BMSCs were transfected with a Snail‑overexpression plasmid (pBabe‑puro‑Snail) and the expression levels of Snail and matrix metalloptoreinase‑2 (MMP‑2) were detected by RT‑qPCR and western blot analyses; thirdly, the cell proliferation and migration of BMSCs modified with pBabe‑puro‑Snail were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and migration assays, respectively; finally, functional recovery of SCI was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating scales. The results showed that NRG1 concentration‑dependently promoted the expression of Snail with a peak at 40 ng/ml and 48 h; NRG1 enhanced the promoting effect of Snail on the expression of MMP‑2; the overexpression of Snail did not enhance the cell growth of the BMSCs. The NRG1‑modified BMSCs promoted the functional recovery of SCI. These results suggested that NRG1 significantly promoted the expression of MMP‑2 by upregulating the expression of Snail, and enhanced cell migration of the BMSCs conducive to the functional recovery of SCI.",ILF3 promotes gastric cancer proliferation and may be used as a prognostic marker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115508,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"Interleukin enhancer‑binding factor 3 (ILF3) may function as a transcriptional coactivator and has been reported to be involved in tumor proliferation and metastasis; however, its role and clinical value in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. To understand the value of ILF3 in GC, a total of 80 matched samples selected from GC tissues and the adjacent mucosa were used to evaluate the expression of ILF3 and its association with clinical characteristics. Furthermore, its biological functions and mechanisms were investigated using SGC‑7901 and BGC823 cell lines. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the positive expression rates of ILF3 in GC tissue were higher compared with those in adjacent mucosa (P<0.05). Significantly overexpressed ILF3 was detected in BGC823 and SGC7901 cells, and the MTT results demonstrated decreased cell activity after ILF3 expression was inhibited. The proportions of cells in the G0/G1 phase increased, while the number of cells in the G2/M phase decreased, and the expression of the genes associated with proliferation varied following inhibition of ILF3 (P<0.05). Positive expression of ILF3 was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with GC, and was an independent risk factor for GC (P<0.05). In conclusion, ILF3 is involved in the deterioration of GC by promoting proliferation of GC cells, and ILF3 protein detection may assist in the prediction of the prognosis of patients with GC.",ΜicroRNA‑421 promotes the progression of non‑small cell lung cancer by targeting HOPX and regulating the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115507,Molecular medicine reports,2019 06 07,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as key regulators of numerous types of cancers. miRNA (miR)‑421 expression is dysregulated in a variety of tumors; however, its role in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the present study, the role and molecular mechanism of miR‑421 in NSCLC was investigated. In this study, miRNA (miR)‑421 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines used the reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Ectopic expression of miR‑421 significantly promoted cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo by promoting cell cycle progression via CCK-8, colony formation, EdU assay, xenograft model and cell cycle assay. In addition, miR‑421 inhibited NSCLC cell apoptosis by flow cytometry apoptosis assay, as evidenced by anti‑apoptosis gene Bcl‑2 and apoptosis gene cleaved caspase‑3 and cleaved PARP using western blot assay. Furthermore, miR‑421 promoted cell migration and invasion through EMT process using Transwell and western blot assay. It was also demonstrated that miR‑421 can directly target HOPX by the EGFP reporter assay and western blot assay. MiR‑421 overexpression promoted the protein expression levels of β‑catenin, cyclin D1 and c‑myc by western blot assay, which are the downstream genes of Wnt pathway. These data indicated that miR‑421 may act as an oncogene through the effects of HOPX on the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway and may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and the identification of potential biomarkers associated with NSCLC."

Targeting mitochondria‑dependent metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy for thyroid cancer (TC) treatment. We hypothesized that mitotane targets mitochondria and induces apoptosis in TC cells. Cell lines representative of the major histological variants of TC were chosen: Follicular (FTC‑133), poorly differentiated (BCPAP), anaplastic (SW1736 and C643) and medullary (TT) TC cells, and were treated with mitotane (0‑100 µM). Mitochondrial membrane potential, cell viability and apoptosis were examined by JC‑1 staining and by western blot analysis using an antibody against caspase‑3. The expression of mitochondrial molecules and DNA damage markers and the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were determined by western blotting. The expression of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit β (ATP5B) was examined by immunostaining in 100 human TC tissue samples. Treatment with mitotane (50 µM for 24 h) decreased the viability of FTC‑133, BCPAP, SW1736, C643 and TT cells by 12, 59, 54, 31 and 66%, respectively. Morphological evidence of ER stress and overexpression of ER markers was observed in TC cells following exposure to mitotane. The treatment led to increased expression of histone γH2AX, indicating DNA damage, and to caspase‑3 cleavage. Consistent with the results of the cell viability assays, the overexpression of pro‑apoptotic genes following treatment with mitotane was more prominent in TC cells harboring mutations in the serine/threonine‑protein kinase B‑raf gene and proto‑oncogene tyrosine‑protein kinase receptor Ret. Treatment with mitotane was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased expression of ATP5B, particularly in the medullary TC (MTC)‑derived TT cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of mitochondrial ATP5B in human TC specimens demonstrated its overexpression in cancer compared with normal thyroid tissue. The level of ATP5B expression was higher in MTC compared with the follicular, papillary or anaplastic types of TC. Mitotane elicited pleiotropic effects on TC cells, including induction of ER stress, inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of apoptosis. The results of the present study suggest that mitotane could be considered as a novel agent for the treatment of aggressive types of TC.",Low‑intensity ultrasound enhances the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cisplatin via altering the miR‑34a/c‑Met axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115495,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"Recently, the use of low‑intensity ultrasound (LIUS) combined with chemotherapeutic agents is widely used in clinical practice, mainly for the treatment of cancer; however, the mechanisms as to how LIUS enhances the antitumor effects of these agents are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to explore the synergistic antitumor effects and mechanisms of cisplatin (DDP) combined with LIUS (LIUS‑DDP) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We reported that LIUS effectively enhanced Huh7 and HCCLM3 cell sensitivity to a low concentration of DDP. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that LIUS could increase the expression of microRNA‑34a (miR‑34a) in HCC cells following DDP treatment. In addition, LIUS‑DDP significantly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in vitro, and the upregulation of miR‑34a induced by LIUS‑DDP was reversed by the ROS scavenger N‑acetylcysteine, suggesting that LIUS upregulates the expression of miR‑34a via production of ROS. In addition, knockdown of miR‑34a in HCC cells significantly suppressed the synergistic effects of LIUS‑DDP treatment. Conversely, overexpression of miR‑34a enhanced these synergistic effects. The results of a dual‑luciferase assay indicated that c‑Met, a well‑known oncogene, was a target of miR‑34a. We also determined that LIUS‑DDP treatment inhibited the expression of c‑Met, possibly due to increased ROS production, which upregulated miR‑34a expression. Furthermore, overexpression of c‑Met reversed the synergistic effects of LIUS‑DDP treatment. Our findings suggest that LIUS could enhance the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to DDP by altering the miR‑34a/c‑Met axis. Therefore, DDP combined with LIUS may be a potential therapeutic application for the clinical treatment of patients with HCC.",The efficacy of cisplatin on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells may be increased via the downregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115494,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"Cisplatin is one of the primary compounds used in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) has emerged to be a promising target for treatment in various tumors. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore whether the expression levels of FGFR2 in NPC tissues and cell lines were altered, and whether the efficiency of cisplatin was increased following the downregulation of FGFR2. The downregulation of FGFR2 was achieved by transfection with a small interfering RNA against FGFR2. Tissues of patients with NPC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Cell viability was examined using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. mRNA and protein levels were measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. FGFR2 was observed to be overexpressed in cancer tissues of patients with NPC and in the NPC SUNE1, C666‑1, 6‑10B and HNE‑3 cell lines, and resulted in an unfavorable prognosis. Cisplatin treatment decreased cell viability and increased FGFR2 expression. The silencing of FGFR2 was demonstrated to augment the effects of cisplatin treatment, including decreasing the cell viability and inducing cell cycle arrest, which involved the increase and decrease of the durations of G1 and S phases, respectively, and a decrease in the expression levels of cyclin D1 and CDC25A, and increasing the rate of apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, as demonstrated by the upregulation of cleaved caspase‑3 and B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2)‑associated X protein and downregulation of Bcl‑2, in SUNE1 and C666‑1 cell lines. FGFR2 was overexpressed in the cancer tissues of patients with NPC and in NPC cell lines, resulting in an unfavorable prognosis. The downregulation of FGFR2 decreased cell viability via cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and increased the efficacy of the cisplatin‑based induction of apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.","Mitochondrial electron transport chain, ROS generation and uncoupling (Review).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115493,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"The mammalian mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) includes complexes I‑IV, as well as the electron transporters ubiquinone and cytochrome c. There are two electron transport pathways in the ETC: Complex I/III/IV, with NADH as the substrate and complex II/III/IV, with succinic acid as the substrate. The electron flow is coupled with the generation of a proton gradient across the inner membrane and the energy accumulated in the proton gradient is used by complex V (ATP synthase) to produce ATP. The first part of this review briefly introduces the structure and function of complexes I‑IV and ATP synthase, including the specific electron transfer process in each complex. Some electrons are directly transferred to O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ETC. The second part of this review discusses the sites of ROS generation in each ETC complex, including sites IF and IQ in complex I, site IIF in complex II and site IIIQo in complex III, and the physiological and pathological regulation of ROS. As signaling molecules, ROS play an important role in cell proliferation, hypoxia adaptation and cell fate determination, but excessive ROS can cause irreversible cell damage and even cell death. The occurrence and development of a number of diseases are closely related to ROS overproduction. Finally, proton leak and uncoupling proteins (UCPS) are discussed. Proton leak consists of basal proton leak and induced proton leak. Induced proton leak is precisely regulated and induced by UCPs. A total of five UCPs (UCP1‑5) have been identified in mammalian cells. UCP1 mainly plays a role in the maintenance of body temperature in a cold environment through non‑shivering thermogenesis. The core role of UCP2‑5 is to reduce oxidative stress under certain conditions, therefore exerting cytoprotective effects. All diseases involving oxidative stress are associated with UCPs.",NMDA receptor activation inhibits the protective effect of BM‑MSCs on bleomycin‑induced lung epithelial cell damage by inhibiting ERK signaling and the paracrine factor HGF.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115492,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is associated with the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM‑MSCs) can exert protective effects on ER‑stressed AECs via paracrine signaling. In the present study, mouse lung epithelial (MLE)‑12 cells were directly stimulated with various concentrations of bleomycin (BLM). MLE‑12 cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and Ki67 expression was detected by immunofluorescence to reflect cell proliferation. The results revealed that BLM increased the protein expression levels of X‑box binding protein 1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain‑binding protein, thus inducing ER stress, and caused cell dysfunction by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. In addition, MSC‑derived conditioned medium (MSC‑CM) protected MLE‑12 cells from BLM‑induced injury, by reducing ER stress, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Our previous studies reported that N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation partially inhibits the antifibrotic effect of BM‑MSCs on BLM‑induced pulmonary fibrosis through downregulating the paracrine factor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In the present study, the synthesis and secretion of HGF were detected by western blotting and ELISA, respectively. Results further demonstrated that NMDA inhibited the synthesis and secretion of HGF in BM‑MSCs, and NMDA‑preconditioned MSC‑CM had no protective effects on BLM‑induced injury in MLE‑12 cells. In addition, activation of the NMDA receptor decreased the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in BM‑MSCs. Using Honokiol and FR180204, the activator and inhibitor of ERK1/2, respectively, it was then revealed that Honokiol partially eliminated the decrease in HGF expression, whereas FR180204 further promoted the reduction in HGF caused by NMDA. Collectively, these findings suggested that NMDA receptor activation may downregulate HGF by inhibiting ERK signaling in BM‑MSCs, thus weakening their protective effects on BLM‑induced lung epithelial cell damage.","miR‑490‑5p regulates the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition of pharyngolaryngeal cancer cells by targeting mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinasekinase 9.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115491,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"MicroRNA (miRNA/miR) has been identified to be a promising tool in treating pharyngolaryngeal cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR‑490‑5p in the regulation of proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pharyngolaryngeal cancer cells. The data of miR‑490‑5p expression levels of 45 cases were obtained from the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the prediction of the target of miR‑490‑5p was conducted by bioinformatics and verified using a luciferase assay. Cell viability was determined by cell counting kit‑8. Migration and invasion rates were measured by wound healing test and Transwell apparatus, respectively. Colony formation rate was measured by plate colony formation assay. mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. miR‑490‑5p expression was significantly depressed in primary pharyngolaryngeal cancer tissues and cell lines, leading to an unfavorable prognosis. Evidently, miR‑490‑5p overexpression decreased the cell viabilities of BICR 18 and FaDu cells. Mechanically, miR‑490‑5p could target mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinasekinase 9 (MAP3K9). The overexpression of MAP3K9 could promote cell viability, migration and invasion rates, EMT process and ability of cloning, miR‑490‑5p could target MAP3K9 and further modulate the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of pharyngolaryngeal cancer cells. The results of the present study provide a novel entry point to the treatment of pharyngolaryngeal cancer.",EGFR monoclonal antibody panitumumab inhibits chronic proliferative cholangitis by downregulating EGFR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115490,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"In hepatolithiasis, chronic proliferative cholangitis (CPC), an active and longstanding inflammation of stone‑containing bile ducts with enhanced mucin‑producing activity, not only affects the progression of the disease, it can also induce biliary carcinogenesis. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody panitumumab (Pani) on CPC. Following the establishment of CPC rat models, periodic acid Schiff staining was used to observe the positive rate of EGFR expression. The expression levels of EGFR, mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), Ki‑67, type I collagen and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the activity of β‑glucuronidase (β‑G), were measured. The rats treated with Pani demonstrated a significantly lower degree of hyperproliferation of the epithelium and submucosal glands of the bile duct and collagen fibers of the bile duct wall, a significantly decreased positive rate of EGFR, reduced phosphorylation of mTOR, decreased expression of EGFR, MUC5AC, Ki‑67 and type I collagen, and reduced β‑G activity. The therapeutic effects in rats treated with 4 and 6 mg/kg of Pani were more marked than those in rats treated with 2 mg/kg of Pani. Collectively, the data obtained in the present study suggest that the EGFR monoclonal antibody Pani can effectively inhibit the excessive proliferation and stone‑forming potential of bile duct mucosa in CPC with a receptor saturation effect. Therefore, Pani offers promise as a treatment for the prevention and control of intrahepatic choledocholithiasis caused by CPC.",Leptin enhances glycolysis via OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion to promote mesenchymal stem cell survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115489,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 07,"Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is emerging as a potential therapy for cardiovascular diseases. However, the poor survival of transplanted MSCs is a major obstacle to improving their clinical efficacy. Accumulating evidence indicates that hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) can improve the survival of MSCs. It has been previously reported that leptin plays a critical role in HPC‑enhanced MSC survival through increasing optic atrophy 1 (OPA1)‑dependent mitochondrial fusion. Survival of MSCs mainly relies on glycolysis as an energy source. The close relationship between leptin and glucose homeostasis has attracted intense scientific interest. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and fission) are associated with alterations in glycolysis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether leptin increases MSC survival through metabolic regulation. Leptin‑modulated increased OPA1 expression was found to be associated with increased glycolysis. However, the glycolytic efficacy of leptin was abrogated after silencing OPA1 using a selective siRNA, suggesting that OPA1 directly regulates glycolysis. Furthermore, the activation of sodium‑glucose symporter 1 (SGLT1) was markedly induced by leptin. However, leptin‑induced glycolysis was primarily blocked by SGLT1 inhibitor treatment. Thus, leptin regulates OPA1‑dependent glycolysis to improve MSC survival primarily through SGLT1 activation. We therefore identified a pivotal leptin/OPA1/SGLT1 signaling pathway for mitochondrial dynamic‑mediated glycolysis, which may optimize the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs.",In vitro treatment of congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia using PLGA nanoparticles loaded with GDP‑Man.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115488,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 07,"Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type Ia is a multisystem disorder that occurs due to mutations in the phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) gene, which encodes for an enzyme involved in the N‑glycosylation pathway. Mutated PMM2 leads to the reduced conversion of mannose‑6‑P to mannose‑1‑P, which results in low concentration levels of guanosine 5'‑diphospho‑D‑mannose (GDP‑Man), a nucleotide‑activated sugar essential for the construction of protein oligosaccharide chains. In the present study, an in vitro therapeutic approach was used, based on GDP‑Man‑loaded poly (D,L‑lactide‑co‑glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs), which were used to treat CDG‑Ia fibroblast cultures, thus bypassing the glycosylation pathway reaction catalysed by PMM2. To assess the degree of hypoglycosylation in vitro, the present study examined the activities of α‑mannosidase, β‑glucoronidase and β‑galactosidase in defective and normal fibroblasts. GDP‑Man (30 µg/ml GDP‑Man PLGA NPs) was incubated for 48 h with the cells and the specific activities of α‑mannosidase and β‑galactosidase were estimated at 69 and 92% compared with healthy controls. The residual activity of β‑glucoronidase increased from 6.5 to 32.5% and was significantly higher compared with that noted in the untreated CDG‑Ia fibroblasts. The glycosylation process of fibroblasts was also analysed by two‑dimensional electrophoresis. The results demonstrated that treatment caused the reappearance of several glycosylated proteins. The data in vitro showed that GDP‑Man PLGA NPs have desirable efficacy and warrant further evaluation in a preclinical validation animal model.",miRNA-302e attenuates inflammation in infantile pneumonia though the RelA/BRD4/NF-κB signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115487,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 06 13,"In the present study, the main focus was investigating the role of microRNA (miRNA)‑302e in infantile pneumonia (IP) and exploring the potential protective mechanisms. Briefly, the expression of miRNA‑302e was reduced in a mouse model of IP. In addition, the administration of anti‑miRNA‑302e increased inflammation and induced the protein expression of RelA, bromodomain‑containing protein 4 (BRD4) and nuclear factor (NF)‑κB in the in vitro model of IP. In contrast, over‑expression of miRNA‑302e reduced inflammation and suppressed the protein expression of RelA, BRD4 and NF‑κB in an in vitro model of IP. Small interfering (si)‑RelA attenuated the effects of miRNA‑302e on inflammation in an in vitro model of IP. Consistently, si‑BRD4 or si‑NF‑κB attenuated the effects of miRNA‑302e on inflammation in an in vitro model of IP. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that miRNA‑302e attenuated inflammation in IP through the RelA/ BRD4/ NF‑κB signaling pathway."

These beetles spend their lives almost entirely under the tree bark, and their survival and reproductive success depend on their ability to overcome the toxic effect of the trees' oleoresin. The cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are associated with the detoxification process of xenobiotics, as well as other physiological processes. Different cytochromes (families 4, 6, and 9) in the Dendroctonus species have been expressed under several experimental conditions; nevertheless, the expression time-course of these genes is unknown. To explore the induction speed of CYPs, we evaluated the relative expression of the CYP6BW5, CYP6DG1, CYP6DJ2, CYP9Z18, and CYP9Z20 genes at the early hours of drilling and settling into a tree (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 h) both in females and males, solitary or paired, of the bark beetle Dendroctonus rhizophagus Thomas and Bright. Our findings show that the five genes were rapidly overexpressed in the early hours (1 to 6 h) in both sexes and in solitary and paired conditions, suggesting their participation in the detoxification process. Additionally, the CYPs expression shows up- and down-regulation patterns through these short times, suggesting their probable participation in other physiological processes as the biosynthesis of hormones, pheromones or compounds related to reproduction.",Rearing Theretra oldenlandiae (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) Larvae on an Artificial Diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115474,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 06 10,"The hawk moth Theretra oldenlandiae (Fabricius) is an important insect pest because in the larval stage it feeds on agricultural crops and ornamental plants such as the eddoe and garden balsam. In this study, we established methods for rearing T. oldenlandiae in the laboratory using an artificial diet containing dry powder of a wild grass Cayratia japonica (Thunb.) Gagnep. Several artificial diets were tested with different ratios of a commercial diet, Insecta LFM, and the dry leaf powder, and including different antibiotics, and the composition of the standard diet on which larvae performed best was determined. The standard diet contains 20 g of Insecta LFM, 4 g of leaf powder, 100 ml of water, 75 mg of chloramphenicol, and 200 μl of propionic acid. Larvae reared on the standard diet became larger pupae than those reared on C. japonica leaves. This result suggests that the larvae have growth potential that is masked on C. japonica leaves, and that C. japonica may not be the most suitable host species for T. oldenlandiae larvae in terms of nutrient level.",Bodyweight-Related Polyandry in the Tobacco Cutworm Moth Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115473,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 06 10,"Recent studies on polyandry evolution have revolutionized our understanding of sexual selection. Therefore, study on traits in females, such as sensory perception and remating strategies, is expected to disclose a greater role of sexual selection in female evolution. Here, we tested how bodyweights of both sexes affected female and male remating behavior in Spodoptera litura (Fabricius, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Results show most (74.4%; unmated virgin females may be sexually immature) females and males mated the first time in the second scotophase after eclosion. In the subsequent scotophase, 41.9% once-mated females and 94.1% once-mated males mated the second time with a novel virgin mate. Analyses indicate that female remating probability significantly increased with the increase of her own and the second male's bodyweight but decreased with the increase of the first male's bodyweight, while bodyweights of both sexes have no significant effect on male remating probability. Considering the nature of the low level of polyandry (two times on average) and last male precedence in S. litura, we propose that 1) females are more choosy when remating, from which females will benefit indirectly by sequential mate comparison and remate to replace sperm from the previous mates with those from higher quality mates, and 2) males will generally like to remate with any possible females, from which males will gain direct benefit by siring more offspring. The outcome of polyandry rate is likely to be the result of male investment × female choice interactions.",Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) in China: Two Invasion Routes and Three Transmission Paths.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115472,Journal of economic entomology,2019 05 22,"Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is one of the most common pests impacting citrus orchards in southern China. Samples of D. citri were collected in southern China in order to systematically explore the genetic architecture of the species. Mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) and cytochrome coxidase subunit I (COI) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which allowed highlighting low haplotype and nucleotide diversities among the population. Two clades could be observed in the haplotype network. Moreover, Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the sequences of Cytb and COI. Here, we report on the significant genetic variation of the species when comparing southwestern China with other regions of southern China (southern and southeastern). This analysis also suggested that the genetic structure of D. citri in China originates may from long-term climate fluctuations concomitant with recent disturbances resulting from human activity. Combined with previous data, the present work indicates that D. citri potentially entered China through two distinct invasion routes and spread within the country via three transmission paths.",Efficacy of Hypoxia Against Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) Throughout Ontogeny.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115471,Journal of economic entomology,2019 06 10,"Hermetic grain storage technology offers a viable chemical-free approach to control storage insects. However, there is limited knowledge on how hypoxia affects the survival of insect life stages during grain storage in hermetic bags. We exposed Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) eggs (2 d), young larvae (7 d), old larvae (21 d), pupae (28 d), and adults (2 d after emergence) to 2, 4, 8, and 20.9% oxygen levels for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 d and assessed subsequent mortality. At 2% oxygen, complete mortality was achieved in 3 d for eggs and young larvae, 10 d for old larvae and pupae, and 15 d for adults. At 4% oxygen, 15 d were required to kill all eggs and old larvae but not the other insect life stages. At 8% oxygen after 15 d, complete mortality of any insect life stage was not observed; but even a relatively short exposure (1-3 d) caused significant developmental delays in immature insects. Our study shows potential utility of hermetic technology for control of T. castaneum, but internal oxygen should be maintained below 2% level for at least 15 d for complete control. Increased oxygen levels improved the development of all insect life stages leading to increased adult emergence. There is a need to explore exposure time required to achieve complete mortality of all insect life stage above the 2% oxygen level.",MITRA-FR vs. COAPT: lessons from two trials with diametrically opposed results.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115470,European heart journal cardiovascular Imaging,2019 06 10,"Percutaneous mitral valve repair using the MitraClip device has been proposed to correct secondary mitral regurgitation (MR).

A priori, these two trials targeted the same patient populations with the same disease using the same device but the results of these trials were diametrically opposed, MITRA-FR being neutral and COAPT being highly positive with respect to efficacy of the MitraClip procedure. The objectives of this viewpoint are: (i) to highlight not only the similarities but also the differences between MITRA-FR and COAPT, which may explain the strikingly different results and conclusions between these two trials and (ii) to derive from these results, implications with regards to the application of the MitraClip procedure in clinical practice.",Idiopathic Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus: Diagnostic Accuracy of Automated Sulcal Morphometry in Patients With Ventriculomegaly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115469,Neurosurgery,2019 05 22,Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a treatable cause of gait and cognitive impairment. iNPH should be differentiated from ventriculomegaly secondary to brain atrophy to choose the best therapeutic option (ventriculoperitoneal shunt vs medical management).,Pituitary Adenoma in Pediatric and Adolescent Populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115468,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2019 05 22,"Pituitary adenomas are rare in children and adolescents and although mostly benign, they can sometimes be challenging to manage due to their locally invasive nature. In this study, we examined the clinicopathologic features of 42 pituitary adenomas in patients ≤21 years of age. The youngest patient was 8 years old (median age: 18 years), and the female-to-male ratio was 1.8:1. Five patients had recurrence after resection. There was no obvious difference between the recurrent rates in the typical (11.7%) and atypical adenomas (12.5%) based on the 2004 WHO classification. However, the recurrence rate was much higher in adenomas with an elevated proliferation index of ≥3% (20.8%) or with evidence of local invasion (18.2%). Adenomas with combination of an elevated proliferation index of ≥3% and imaging evidence of local invasion had the highest recurrence rate of 25%. In summary, pituitary adenomas are more frequent in adolescents as compared with children and are more common in girls. An elevated proliferation index of ≥3% and evidence of local invasion on imaging seem to correlate with a high probability of recurrence. Furthermore, we observe rarity of α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) protein loss (surrogate to ATRX mutation) in these tumors without any connotation on prognosis.",NRAMP1 promotes iron uptake at the late stage of iron deficiency in poplars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115467,Tree physiology,2019 05 22,"Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plant survival and proliferation. Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to maintain Fe homeostasis in response to Fe deficiency. In this study, we evaluated the physiological, biochemical, and transcriptomic differences between poplars grown under Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions to elucidate the mechanistic responses of poplars to Fe deficiency. Our results revealed that chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis were inhibited, under Fe-deficient conditions. The inhibition of these pathways caused chlorosis and reduced shoot growth. Although both photosynthetic systems (PSI and PSII) were inhibited under Fe limitation, PSI was affected more severely and earlier than PSII. Fe deficiency also promoted root growth and increased the accumulation of divalent metal ions in roots. IRT1 and NRAMP1 are both Fe2+ transporters for iron uptake in Arabidopsis. In this study however, only NRAMP1 was induced to promote Fe2+ uptake in roots at the late stage of Fe deficiency response. It indicated that NRAMP1, rather than the more well-known IRT1, might be a major Fe2+ transporter at the late stage of Fe-deficiency in poplars.",Global Geographic Trends in Antimicrobial Resistance: The Role of International Travel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115466,Journal of travel medicine,2019 05 22,"Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to modern medicine and increasing international mobility facilitates the spread of AMR.

Therefore, integrating the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, with the soil-dwelling rove beetle, Dalotia coriaria (Kraatz), targeting different aboveground and belowground life stages may help effectively manage western flower thrips populations. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted evaluating five treatments: 1) insecticides (spinosad, pyridalyl, chlorfenapyr, and abamectin), 2) B. bassiana, 3) D. coriaria, 4) B. bassiana and D. coriaria combination, and 5) water control. The estimated mean number of western flower thrips adults captured on yellow sticky cards was significantly lower for the insecticide treatment (mean range: 0-46 western flower thrips adults per yellow sticky card) than the B. bassiana and D. coriaria combination (0.3-105.1 western flower thrips per yellow card) over 8 wk. There were no significant differences in the final foliar damage ratings of chrysanthemum, Dendranthema × grandiflorum (Ramat.)

In experiment 2, chrysanthemum plants across all treatments were not marketable due to western flower thrips feeding damage. Therefore, using B. bassiana and D. coriaria early in production should suppress population growth by targeting both foliar-feeding and soil-dwelling life stages of western flower thrips simultaneously.",Cellular development in muscle differs between Angus steers from low and high muscle score selection lines1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115451,Journal of animal science,2019 05 22,"This study assessed cellular characteristics of longissimus lumborum (LL) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles in steers genetically selected for low (Low) or high (High) muscling using live muscle scoring, and High steers with 1 copy of the loss-of-function 821 del11 MSTN allele (HighHet). We hypothesized High and HighHet have altered muscle cellular characteristics and mechanisms influencing muscling compared with Low steers. Angus steers 25 mo old comprising 14 High, 19 Low, and 11 HighHet were backgrounded to 20 mo of age, grain finished for 150 d, and then slaughtered. Body and carcass weights did not differ due to muscling line (P = 0.46). Weight of LL was 16% greater (P = 0.004) and total protein in LL was 18% greater (P = 0.012) in HighHet than Low steers. ST weight in HighHet was 10% and 13% greater than in High and Low steers (P = 0.007), respectively, and of total ST protein 12% and 17% greater in HighHet than High or Low (P = 0.002). Cross-sectional area (CSA) of LL was greater in HighHet than in High and greater in High than in Low (85.0 vs. 77.0 vs. 70.4 cm2, P < 0.001). Apparent number of myofibers and myofibers per unit CSA did not differ between the muscling lines in LL (P = 0.14) or ST (P = 0.47). Myofiber CSA was greater in the ST of Low than of High and HighHet for type 1 (36% and 31% respectively, P = 0.005) and 2A (22% and 25%, P < 0.001). HighHet steers had greater area of glycolytic (type 2X) relative to more oxidative myofiber types within LL (P = 0.02; 11% and 43% more than High and Low, respectively) and ST (P < 0.001; 27% and 75%). Concentration of RNA in LL was 13% and 10% greater (P = 0.005) in High than in Low and HighHet, respectively, and total amount of RNA in LL was 22% greater in High and 20% greater in HighHet than in Low (P < 0.001). The LL of High steers had less protein to RNA (P = 0.03; 57.4 vs. 65.6) and more RNA to DNA (P = 0.007; 9.03 vs. 7.83) than Low. HighHet steers had 11% more DNA in ST than High (P = 0.04) and 19% more RNA in ST than Low (P = 0.012). The shift towards glycolytic myofibers was consistent with loadings in a principal component that explained 39% of the variation in LL and 38% in ST. Overall, these findings show that selection for increased muscling using live cattle muscle scoring, and 1 copy of the 821 del11 MSTN allele, results in more glycolytic muscle. They also suggest that increased muscling of the High compared with Low steers may be associated with increased translational capacity in the LL.",Developing Mass Egg-Laying Medium for the Edible Ruspolia differens (Orthoptera: Tettigonidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115450,Journal of economic entomology,2019 05 22,"The edible katydid, Ruspolia differens (Serville), is an economically and nutritionally important insect species that is common and widespread in Africa. Currently, there are aims to develop mass-rearing methods suitable for this species, but a critical first step would require a suitable oviposition medium to ensure economic and easy production of eggs with high hatchability. The objective of the present study was to determine the oviposition preference and egg hatchability in different oviposition media. Based on preliminary testing of a wide range of different materials, two oviposition media, namely, artificial (folded plastic cloth) and natural medium (leaf sheath of Pennisetum purpureum Schumach attached to a stem), were selected for a detailed experiment. A two-choice laboratory experiment was conducted in which R. differens females were able to select between the folded plastic cloth (one side covered with short fleece) and a leaf sheath of P. purpureum (wrapped in polyester fiber). The results show that R. differens laid almost three times more eggs on the plastic cloth (mean ± SE, 169.3 ± 18.0) than on the natural substrate, P. purpurem (69.0 ± 13.9). However, the hatchability (overall mean% ± SE, 56.5 ± 4.7) of eggs in the two media did not differ. Folded plastic cloth, therefore, provided a more effective medium for egg laying by R. differens, and is thus a promising oviposition medium for getting natural populations to start laying eggs in future mass rearing.",A Systematic Review of Older Adults' Attitudes towards Depression and its Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115449,The Gerontologist,2019 05 22,"Late-life depression is a major societal concern, but older adults' attitudes toward its treatment remain complex.

Neoseiulus fallacis adults were exposed to field-aged residues, and mortality and lethal time were measured over 96 h of exposure. Carbaryl caused high mortality to N. fallacis and the shortest lethal time values (LT50), followed by spinetoram, with moderate lethal time values. Esfenvalerate, acetamiprid, chlorantraniliprole, and novaluron showed little to no lethality to N. fallacis following exposure to dry field-aged residues.

It is unknown how these changes have affected the native bee community. We surveyed the bee communities in relatively intact native prairie at two National Wildlife Refuges in Texas, quantifying bee community structure as a function of the presence/absence of grazing by prairie dogs. Over a 5-mo sampling period in spring-summer 2013, we found high overall bee diversity (180 species, mostly solitary ground-nesters), with differences detected in diversity between Muleshoe and Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuges as well as on and off prairie dog colonies. Although the same three species dominated the bee community at both refuges, most species were represented by relatively few individuals, leading to overall differences in diversity (richness, evenness, and effective number of species) by refuge. Bee diversity differed between sites on and off prairie dog colonies, but in trends that differed by refuge and by index, suggesting that location was more important than prairie dog presence. These results represent a reference fauna against which other regional bee communities in other land-cover types can be compared, but the high spatial heterogeneity we found indicates that detecting effects of landscape change on native bees will be challenging.",Nursing Staff Time and Care Quality in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115444,The Gerontologist,2019 05 22,"In long-term care (LTC) facilities, nursing staff are important contributors to resident care and well-being.

Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with a TRPC5 specific radioligand may provide a unique tool to investigate the functions of TRPC5 in animal disease models to guide drug development targeting TRPC5. To develop a TRPC5 PET radiotracer, the potent TRPC5 inhibitor HC608 was chosen for C-11 radiosynthesis through the N-demethyl amide precursor 7 reacting with [11C]methyl iodide. Under optimized conditions, [11C]HC608 was achieved with good radiochemical yield (25 ± 5%), high chemical and radiochemical purity (>99%), and high specific activity (204-377 GBq μmol-1, decay corrected to the end of bombardment, EOB). The in vitro autoradiography study revealed that [11C]HC608 specifically binds to TRPC5. Moreover, initial in vivo evaluation of [11C]HC608 performed in rodents and the microPET study in the brain of non-human primates further demonstrated that [11C]HC608 was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and sufficiently accumulate in the brain.

The decreased reactivity of MTA in comparison with the 8-aminoquinoline (AQ) directing group allows for selective monoarylations in high yields without the formation of side products. The protocol is also suitable for the introduction of highly functionalised side chains onto the C-terminal alanines of dipeptides. The MTA directing group can easily be removed, providing free carboxylic acids as valuable building blocks.","The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of CF3-containing spiro-oxindole-pyrrolidine-pyrazolone compounds through squaramide-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115424,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 05,"Pharmaceutically important compounds were synthesized through the organocatalytic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.

From the morphogenesis stage, cells' ability to sustain stress is essential for the body's well-being. Several pathologies have been associated with abnormal mechanical properties, thus suggesting the Young's modulus as a biomarker to diagnose diseases and determine their progression. Advancements in the field are quite slow because current techniques for measuring cell and tissue mechanics rely on complex and bulky measurement platforms that have low repeatability rates and limited measurement time-scales. We present the first miniaturized system that allows accurate quantification of the Young's modulus of adherent cell monolayers over a longer time (1-2 days). Our approach is based on tensile testing and optical read-out. Thanks to a thoughtful design and material choice, we are able to miniaturize tensile testing platforms into a 1 cm × 2 cm device. We provide highly repeatable Young's modulus measurements in the relevant range between 3 kPa and 300 kPa, over time and under physiological conditions, thus representing an interesting alternative to existing measurement platforms. Furthermore, the compatibility with standard biological equipment, continuous optical imaging and measurements on all types of adherent cells make this device highly versatile. Measurements on human sarcoma osteogenic (SaOS2) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) are reported. The demonstrated capability to measure real-time changes in mechanical properties, such as after chemical treatment, opens the door for investigating the effects of drugs on cell mechanics.",Switchable circularly polarized luminescence from a photoacid co-assembled organic nanotube.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115419,Nanoscale,2019 05 30,"Materials with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are currently attracting great interest in view of their potential applications. Here, we reported self-assembled organic nanotubes with switchable CPL performance. A photoacid, 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate (HPTS), was co-assembled with an amino-terminated dialkyl glutamide (LG or DG) in mixed solvents of DMF and water. The complex of LG (DG)/HPTS self-assembled into nanotube structures in the tested range of mixed solvents and showed CPL emission. Different mixing ratios of DMF to water in the solvent triggered CPL switching between different wavelengths. It was revealed that the switching of CPL resulted from the different emissions of the protonated (ROH) and deprotonated (RO-) forms of HPTS, which could be regulated by the solvent polarity. Interestingly, the addition of an acid or base could also switch the fluorescence of LG (DG)/HPTS co-assemblies and the corresponding CPL, leading to an acidity-regulated CPL switch. Thus, through a simple co-assembly strategy, switchable CPL was realized in the self-assembled organic nanotubes via both solvent polarity and acidity.",Cost-effective approach to detect Cu(ii) and Hg(ii) by integrating a smartphone with the colorimetric response from a NBD-benzimidazole based dyad.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115416,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 05,"A new optical chemosensor N1 was designed and synthesized by condensing 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan with 2-aminophenylbenzimidazole. In CH3OH : H2O (1 : 1, v/v) medium, sensor N1 exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity towards Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions by showing a distinct colour change from pale yellow to pink due to the internal charge transfer occurring between the sensor N1 and the Cu2+/Hg2+ ions upon complexation in 1 : 1 stoichiometry. Also, the binding of Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions with N1 resulted in new absorption bands at 540 nm and 375 nm with the concurrent disappearance of the sensor absorption bands at 485 nm and 321 nm. Using the spectral changes of N1, the concentrations of Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions can be detected down to 1.23 × 10-7 M and 4.70 × 10-7 M, respectively. Further, the colour change of N1 in the presence of Cu2+/Hg2+ ions was integrated with a smartphone colour-scanning app to measure the red-green-blue (RGB) colour intensity, and a cost-effective method was developed for the on-site detection of Cu2+/Hg2+ ions. Finally, the practicability of sensor N1 to quantify Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions in real water samples was successfully validated by using both the UV-vis spectrophotometer and the smartphone.",A ligand strand that displays anion-dependant reactivity with acetonitrile; formation of either a mononuclear complex or head-to-tail circular helicate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115415,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 06 13,"The ligand L2,2 contains two bidentate domains separated by a 3,3-diamino-2,2'-biphenyl spacer unit and with Cu(ClO4)2 a mononuclear species is formed (e.g. [Cu(L2,2)]2+).

We systematically investigate the effects of the grafting density (Ng), the component ratio (α) and the flexibility of the grafted diblock copolymer on the structural and mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Interestingly, we observe that the grafted NPs can form a core-shell like structure attributed to the adsorption of the A-blocks onto the NPs, validated by the radial distribution function of the A and B blocks away from the surface of the NPs. The integrity of the core-shell structure is influenced by the grafting density and the component ratio of the grafted chains. The core-shell structure of the NPs becomes more perfect with greater Ng. The morphology of the NPs is shifted from a network structure to an isolated or well dispersed state upon increasing the grafting density. Meanwhile, we analyze the evolution of the morphology of the NPs during the uniaxial tensile process by calculating the number of neighboring NPs as a function of strain, thus finding that the NP network is broken-up at low grafting density, while only a little change is observed at high grafting density. Upon increasing the component ratio of the B-block to the A-block, the dispersion of the NPs becomes better, characterized by the radial distribution function of NPs-NPs, NPs-A-blocks, NPs-B-blocks, NPs-matrix, the number of neighboring NPs and the snapshots. Lastly, by changing the B-block from being flexible to stiff, the core-shell structure of the NPs disappears after the formation of a typical capsule morphology. This capsule-ordered structure becomes more prominent with the increase in Ng. Remarkably, compared to the effect of the core-shell morphology on the mechanical properties, the capsule morphology reinforces the mechanical properties more obviously. In general, this simulation work provides a deep insight into the structural and mechanical properties of NPs grafted with diblock copolymer chains, in the hope of providing some guidance on the design and preparation of high-performance PNCs.",The dynamic evaporation process of the deep eutectic solvent LiTf2N:N-methylacetamide at ambient temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115401,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 05,"Lithium-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are potential and promising electrolytes for energy-storing devices such as the lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor due to their greenness, low cost, favorable stability, and ease of synthesis. LiTf2N (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide):NMA (N-methylacetamide) is a liquid due to the strong intermolecular H-bonding interaction between the H-bonding acceptor (HBA, LiTf2N) and H-bonding donor (HBD, NMA). The properties (melting point, conductivity, viscosity, etc.) of LiTf2N:NMA change with the evaporation of NMA from LiTf2N:NMA, which would further influence the performance of the energy-storing devices. The evaporation of DES should be determined by the intermolecular interactions. Here, for the first time, the dynamic process of evaporation and intermolecular interactions of the DES LiTf2N:NMA at room temperature were investigated and we find that the evaporation mechanism of the DES LiTf2N:NMA can be divided into three stages. In the first stage (before 110 min), the H-bonding interaction between O in LiTf2N and NH in NMA is disrupted before destruction of the coordinating interaction related to amide II C[double bond, length as m-dash]O and Li cation. In the second stage (from 110 min to 270 min), the change of coordinating interaction related to amide II C[double bond, length as m-dash]O and Li cation is also higher than that of the H-bonded interaction. In the third stage (after 270 min), evaporation of NMA from LiTf2N:NMA has very little influence on the environment of LiTf2N:NMA. This work provides a guide for designing DESs as electrolytes for energy-storing devices such as the lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor.",Hydrogen atom attachment to histidine and tryptophan containing peptides in the gas phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115400,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 05,"In this study, we use a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and hydrogen radical-mediated fragmentation techniques to analyze the sequence of peptides. We focus on fragmentation induced by the attachment of hydrogen atoms to the histidine and tryptophan residue side-chains in the peptide that occurs in the gas-phase. The hydrogen atom attached to the imidazole and indole rings in the histidine and tryptophan residues, respectively, and the resulting intermediate experienced Cα-Cβ bond cleavage. The detailed fragmentation mechanism is investigated by computational analysis using density functional theory. According to the results, hydrogen attachment occurs at the C-5 position in histidine and at the C-2 position in the tryptophan, which has a lower activation energy compared with the other positions and the resulting intermediate radicals yielded fragments due to Cα-Cβ bond cleavage. For the peptides that contain the histidine and tryptophan residues, cleavages in the Cα-Cβ and N-Cα bonds occurred independently. Therefore, the method presented in this study is applicable when analyzing peptides that contain histidine and tryptophan residues.",Intrinsically fluorescent gold nanoclusters stabilized within a copper storage protein that follow the Irving-Williams trend in metal ion sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115399,The Analyst,2019 05 22,"Creating new environmentally friendly and non-toxic biomaterials with novel properties is required for numerous applications in healthcare and sensing. Protein bound gold nanoclusters constitute one such class of materials that offer promise in fluorescence imaging and sensing applications. However, unlike alkane thiol-protected gold nanoclusters, the number of protein-templated gold nanoclusters with such properties is limited and there is a need to expand the repertoire of such attractive hybrid quantum clusters. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and applications of new fluorescent gold nanoclusters with tunable emission properties including blue, orange, and red, within a four-helix bundle copper storage protein (Csp1). The template protein consists of 13 cysteines along the length of the helix, which are suitable ligands to template Au and stabilize the resulting 14-19 atom clusters within the protein. The resulting clusters were extensively characterized by employing spectroscopic, microscopic and other analytical methods. The optical emission, relative quantum yields, and the excited state lifetime of the clusters are shown to depend on synthetic conditions. The clusters were found to be sensitive to the ppm level of transition metal ions with the quenching capabilities following the Irving-Williams series of metals (Co2+ < Ni2+ < Cu2+), which is rationalized based on the relative affinities of transition metals for a given set of ligands. The clusters were also found to be stable across the pH range 4-8.5 which, along with tunable emission properties paves the path for live bio-imaging and bio-sensing applications under physiological conditions.",Monitoring 111In-labelled polyisocyanopeptide (PIC) hydrogel wound dressings in full-thickness wounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115398,Biomaterials science,2019 05 22,"Wounds often result in scarring, prolonged morbidity, and loss of function. New interactive and modifiable hydrogel wound dressings are being developed for these injuries. Polyisocyanopeptide (PIC) gel is a promising thermosensitive hydrogel having several characteristics that can facilitate wound repair, including ease of application/removal and strain-stiffening properties that mimic extracellular matrix components. However, it is unknown whether the PIC gel remains in the wound for a clinically relevant time period. Therefore, PIC polymers were functionalized with a DTPA group allowing labelling with Indium-111 (111In). Following application of this radiolabelled gel to splinted and non-splinted murine full-thickness skin wounds the signal was monitored using SPECT/CT imaging for 7 days. The SPECT signal from the PIC gel was highly stable and covered the complete wound area. Non-bound 111In-EDTA was rapidly cleared via the kidneys to the urine. The impact of PIC gels on wound repair was further studied visually and histologically. Radiolabelled PIC gel was observed to move both over and under the skin, while histological analysis demonstrated that part of the gel became encapsulated within the wound repair tissue, but did not delay wound closure or otherwise impair wound healing. This work illustrates for the first time the use of 111In-labelled PIC gels for diagnostic and monitoring purposes and describes the use of PIC in the (non-)splinted murine skin wound model. It was found that PIC gels remained in splinted and non-splinted full-thickness skin wounds during wound repair. This warrants the continuation of developing the PIC gel into a clinically advanced wound dressing.",Antioxidant properties of ALD grown nanoceria films with tunable valency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115397,Biomaterials science,2019 05 22,"Herein, we provide the first account of a method to control cerium oxide's mixed valence states (as Ce3+ to Ce4+ ratio) in ultra-thin films formed via atomic layer deposition (ALD). It is determined that modulation of Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio occurs with respect to film thickness and is analogous to the change in surface chemistry observed for cerium oxide nanoparticles with varying particle diameter. The influence of film thickness on enzyme-mimetic radical scavenging is also characterized. Higher film thicknesses show 9-fold increase in catalytic activity. In vitro biocompatibility (apoptosis < 4%) and electrochemical biosensing (lowest concentration: 18 ppt) studies were performed to demonstrate the potential of ALD-grown nanoceria films for biomedical applications.","Correction: Quantification of isomerically summed hydrocarbon contributions to crude oil by carbon number, double bond equivalent, and aromaticity using gas chromatography with tunable vacuum ultraviolet ionization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115396,The Analyst,2019 06 10,"Correction for 'Quantification of isomerically summed hydrocarbon contributions to crude oil by carbon number, double bond equivalent, and aromaticity using gas chromatography with tunable vacuum ultraviolet ionization' by Jeremy A.

Herein, we developed a multifunctional nanocomplex (Bi2Se3@PEG/DOX/Ce6 nanocapsules, or BPDC NCs in brief) which was constructed by loading chlorin e6 (Ce6) and doxorubicin (DOX) into PEGylated hollow bismuth selenide nanocapsules. Upon administration of BPDC NCs, composite laser irradiation can effectively activate the local hyperthermia generation and the yield of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). In another aspect, on-demand drug release can be triggered in a mild acidic tumor microenvironment or by thermal shock. Moreover, imaging and navigation with respect to infrared thermography, computed tomography (CT) and fluorescence imaging may potentially monitor the biodistribution of BPDC NCs, thanks to the local hyperthermia generation, fluorescence emission of Ce6 and high Z-element of bismuth. Finally, we demonstrated tumor site-specific photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapeutic effects for highly efficacious tumor suppression with minimized systemic toxicity. Taken together, these findings indeed provide insights that can broaden the application of Bi2Se3 nanocapsules for cancer management and precision medicine.",Probing the selectivity of Li+ and Na+ cations on noradrenaline at the molecular level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115392,Faraday discussions,2019 05 22,"Although several mechanisms concerning the biological function of lithium salts, drugs having tranquilizing abilities, have been proposed so far, the key mechanism for its selectivity and subsequent interaction with neurotransmitters has not been established yet. We report ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectra under ultra-cold conditions of Li+ and Na+ complexes of noradrenaline (NAd, norepinephrine), a neurotransmitter responsible for the body's response to stress or danger, in an effort to provide a molecular level understanding of the conformational changes of NAd due to its interactions with these two cations. A detailed analysis of the IR spectra, aided by quantum chemical calculations, reveals that the Li+-noradrenaline (NAd-Li+) complex forms only an extended structure, while the NAd-Na+ and protonated (NAd-H+) complexes form both folded and extended structures. This conformational preference of the NAd-Li+ complex is further explained by considering specific conformational distributions in solution. Our results clearly discern the unique structural motifs that NAd adopts when interacting with Li+ compared with other abundant cations in the human body (Na+) and can form the basis of a molecular level understanding of the selectivity of Li+ in biological systems.",Enhanced biodegradation of atrazine at high infiltration rates in agricultural soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115391,Environmental science. Processes & impacts,2019 05 23,"The objective of this study was to assess the persistence and transport of atrazine at high infiltration rates expected from higher intensity precipitation associated with climate change scenarios in the midwestern U.S. The transport and transformation of atrazine was monitored in column experiments at high infiltration rates (64-119 mm d-1) associated with increased precipitation intensity. The optimum linear sorption and the lumped Monod biokinetic parameters were determined by inverting observed break-through curves (BTCs) using the advection-dispersion-sorption-degradation model. Batch microcosm studies were also conducted to examine the effect of moisture content (5%, 15% and 25%) on atrazine degradation and support the column results. BTCs from both soil types with continuous atrazine input showed a characteristic pattern of a pulse input i.e. lag phase prior to rapid atrazine degradation. The rate of atrazine leaching at higher infiltration rates was not fast enough to counteract the effect of enhanced degradation. Higher infiltration rates enriched the distribution of hydroxyatrazine in the soil profile for sandy loam, but their effect was minimal in loam soil. The pattern of degradation obtained in batch microcosms agreed with the column results. In both soils, mean half-life of atrazine was lower (4-8 days) at high soil moisture contents. Under future climate change scenarios, where more intense precipitation is likely to result in higher infiltration rates and increased soil moisture, the potential for groundwater pollution from atrazine may be reduced, especially in areas with a long history of atrazine application to soil."

The last few decades have witnessed the emergence of non-viral causes of HCC, the most important being non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis in the absence of excessive alcohol intake to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without cirrhosis. About 3-15 per cent of the obese patients with NASH progress to cirrhosis and about 4-27 per cent of NASH with cirrhosis patients transform to HCC. It is also known that HCC can develop de novo in patients with NASH without the presence of cirrhosis. Yearly cumulative incidence of NASH-related HCC is low (2.6%) compared to four per cent of viral-HCC. NAFLD has been associated with risk factors such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, altered gut flora and persistent inflammation. Due to alarming rise in metabolic diseases, both in the developing as well as the developed world, it is expected that the incidence of NAFLD/NASH-HCC would rise manifold in future. No definite guidelines have been drawn for surveillance and management of NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC. It is thus important to discuss the entity of HCC in NAFLD at length with special focus on its epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation and prevention.","Prostate cancer upgrading or downgrading of biopsy Gleason scores at radical prostatectomy: prediction of ""regression to the mean"" using routine clinical features with correlating biochemical relapse rates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115364,Asian journal of andrology,2019 05 22,"Recommendations for managing clinically localized prostate cancer are structured around clinical risk criteria, with prostate biopsy (PB) Gleason score (GS) being the most important factor. Biopsy to radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen upgrading/downgrading is well described, and is often the rationale for costly imaging or genomic studies. We present simple, no-cost analyses of clinical parameters to predict which GS 6 and GS 8 patients will change to GS 7 at prostatectomy. From May 2006 to December 2012, 1590 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). After exclusions, we identified a GS 6 cohort of 374 patients and a GS 8 cohort of 91 patients. During this era, >1000 additional patients were enrolled in an active surveillance (AS) program. For GS 6, 265 (70.9%) of 374 patients were upgraded, and the cohort included 183 (48.9%) patients eligible for AS by the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance Study (PRIAS) standards, of which 57.9% were upgraded. PB features that predicted a >90% chance of upgrading included ≥ 7 cores positive, maximum foci length ≥ 8 mm in any core, and total tumor involvement ≥ 30%. For GS 8, downgrading occurred in 46 (50.5%), which was significantly higher for single core versus multiple cores (80.4% vs 19.6%, P = 0.011).

We identified STAG3 in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) and normozoospermia in the Korean population. The coding regions and their intron boundaries of STAG3 were identified in 120 Korean men with spermatogenic impairments and 245 normal controls by using direct sequencing and haplotype analysis. A total of 30 sequence variations were identified in this study. Of the total, seven were exonic variants, 18 were intronic variants, one was in the 5'-UTR, and four were in the 3'-UTR. Pathogenic variations that directly caused NOA were not identified. However, two variants, c.3669+35C>G (rs1727130) and +198A>T (rs1052482), showed significant differences in the frequency between the patient and control groups (P = 0.021, odds ratio [OR]: 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.098-2.918) and were tightly linked in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. When pmir-rs1052482A was cotransfected with miR-3162-5p, there was a substantial decrease in luciferase activity, compared with pmir-rs1052482T. This result suggests that rs1052482 was located within a binding site of miR-3162-5p in the STAG3 3'-UTR, and the minor allele, the rs1052482T polymorphism, might offset inhibition by miR-3162-5p.

Results indicated that PDD patients' performance in cognitive functioning and financial capacity is severely impaired, while there is a statistically significant difference between depressed and non-depressed PDD patients. Differences in financial capacity performance indicate that depression should not be disregarded. Further studies on larger PDD population are necessary in order to investigate the decisive role of depression on financial capacity impairment."

Here, we present the mechanism of peptidyltransferase centre (PTC) completion that explains how integration of the last ribosomal proteins is coupled to release of the nuclear export adaptor Nmd3. Single-particle cryo-EM reveals that eL40 recruitment stabilizes helix 89 to form the uL16 binding site. The loading of uL16 unhooks helix 38 from Nmd3 to adopt its mature conformation. In turn, partial retraction of the L1 stalk is coupled to a conformational switch in Nmd3 that allows the uL16 P-site loop to fully accommodate into the PTC where it competes with Nmd3 for an overlapping binding site (base A2971). Our data reveal how the central functional site of the ribosome is sculpted and suggest how the formation of translation-competent 60S subunits is disrupted in leukaemia-associated ribosomopathies.","Structure of the gene therapy vector, adeno-associated virus with its cell receptor, AAVR.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115336,eLife,2019 06 15,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are preeminent in emerging clinical gene therapies.

Interactions of AAV with its cellular receptor, AAVR, are key to understanding cell-entry and trafficking with the rigor needed to engineer tissue-specific vectors. Cryo-electron tomography shows ordered binding of part of the flexible receptor to the viral surface, with distal domains in multiple conformations. Regions of the virus and receptor in close physical proximity can be identified by cross-linking/mass spectrometry. Cryo-electron microscopy with a two-domain receptor fragment reveals the interactions at 2.4 Å resolution. AAVR binds between AAV's spikes on a plateau that is conserved, except in one clade whose structure is AAVR-incompatible. AAVR's footprint overlaps the epitopes of several neutralizing antibodies, prompting a re-evaluation of neutralization mechanisms.

Although significant progress has been made in understanding centriole composition, we have limited knowledge of how PLK4 activity controls specific steps in centriole formation. Here, we show that PLK4 phosphorylates its centriole substrate STIL on a conserved site, S428, to promote STIL binding to CPAP. This phospho-dependent binding interaction is conserved in Drosophila and facilitates the stable incorporation of both STIL and CPAP into the centriole. We propose that procentriole assembly requires PLK4 to phosphorylate STIL in two different regions: phosphorylation of residues in the STAN motif allow STIL to bind SAS6 and initiate cartwheel assembly, while phosphorylation of S428 promotes the binding of STIL to CPAP, linking the cartwheel to microtubules of the centriole wall.",[Hachimoji DNA extends coding possibilities].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115333,Medecine sciences : M/S,2019 05 22,"The synthesis of four new nucleotide analogues that can form hydrogen bonds within the DNA double helix and can be incorporated without distortion of the structure extends the possibilities of synthetic biology.

For RSV seasonality evaluation, epidemic thresholds (i) at 1.2% of the cumulative number of RSV-positive patients per season and (ii) at 20 detections per week (for laboratory data) were employed. We also assessed MEM thresholds.ResultsIn laboratory data RSV was reported 25,491 times (no denominator). In sentinel data 5.6% (767/13,577) of specimens tested RSV positive. Over 12 seasons, sentinel data showed percentage increases of RSV positive samples. The average epidemic length was 18.0 weeks (95% confidence intervals (CI):  16.3-19.7) and 16.5 weeks (95% CI: 14.0-18.0) for laboratory and sentinel data, respectively. Epidemics started on average in week 46 (95% CI: 45-48) and 47 (95% CI:  46-49), respectively. The peak was on average in the first week of January in both datasets. MEM showed similar results to the other methods. RSV incidence was highest in youngest (0-1 and >1-2 years) and oldest (>65-75 and > 75 years) age groups, with age distribution remaining stable over time. RSV-type dominance alternated every one or two seasons.ConclusionsOur findings provide baseline information for immunisation advisory groups.

In 2014, when the present study was designed, there were also plans to make neuroborreliosis notifiable within the European Union.AimWe compared possibilities of surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Sweden through two different sources: the hospital discharge register and reporting from the clinical microbiology laboratories.MethodsWe examined the validity of ICD-10 codes in the hospital discharge register by extracting personal identification numbers for all cases of neuroborreliosis, defined by a positive cerebrospinal fluid-serum anti-Borrelia antibody index, who were diagnosed at the largest clinical microbiology laboratory in Sweden during 2014. We conducted a retrospective observational study with a questionnaire sent to all clinical microbiology laboratories in Sweden requesting information on yearly number of cases, age group and sex for the period 2010 to 2014.ResultsAmong 150 neuroborreliosis cases, 67 (45%) had received the ICD-10 code A69.2 (Lyme borreliosis) in combination with G01.9 (meningitis in bacterial diseases classified elsewhere), the combination that the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommends for neuroborreliosis. All 22 clinical laboratories replied to our questionnaire. Based on laboratory reporting, the annual incidence of neuroborreliosis in Sweden was 6.3 cases per 100,000 in 2014.ConclusionThe hospital discharge register was unsuitable for surveillance of neuroborreliosis, whereas laboratory-based reporting was a feasible alternative. In 2018, the European Commission included Lyme neuroborreliosis on the list of diseases under epidemiological surveillance.","Health Beliefs and Patient Perspectives of Febrile Illness in Kilombero, Tanzania.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115309,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 22,"This qualitative study assessed the knowledge and beliefs surrounding fever syndrome among adult febrile patients seeking health care in Kilombero, Tanzania.

Interviews were audio recorded, translated, and transcribed. Transcripts were coded using NVivo Version 11.1, and the thematic content was analyzed by two separate researchers. Blood and nasopharyngeal/oralpharyngeal specimens were collected and analyzed using both acute febrile illness and respiratory TaqMan Array Cards for multipathogen detection of 56 potential causative agents. A total of 18 participants provided 188 discrete comments. When asked to speculate the causative agent of febrile illness, 33.3% cited malaria and the other 66.6% offered nonbiomedical responses, such as ""mosquitoes"" and ""weather."" Major themes emerging related to severity and susceptibility to health hazards included lack of bed net use, misconceptions about bed nets, and mosquito infestation. Certain barriers to treatment were cited, including dependence on traditional healers, high cost of drugs, and poor dispensary services. Overall, we demonstrate low concurrence in speculations of fever etiology according to patients, clinicians, and laboratory testing. Our findings contribute to the important, yet limited, base of knowledge surrounding patient risk perceptions of febrile illness and underscore the potential utility of community-based participatory research to inform disease control programs.","Risk of Measles and Diphtheria Introduction and Transmission on Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands, 2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115308,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 22,"Endemic transmission of measles has been reestablished in Venezuela, and outbreaks of diphtheria remain ongoing across Latin America (LA).

Participants (aged 0-90 years) donated a blood sample and completed a questionnaire (n = 1,129). Antibodies against measles and diphtheria were tested using bead-based multiplex immunoassays. Our data revealed that immunity against measles is suboptimal, especially for those aged less than 5 years from Suriname, Aruba, and former Dutch Antilles (SADA), and adolescents from LA; and against diphtheria for persons aged more than 30 years, particularly among females and residents from SADA and LA. As refugees arrive persistently, health authorities on the Dutch Leeward Antilles should be on alert to detect early cases and prevent subsequent transmission.

This review aims to update the existing literature on risk factors, clinical presentations, constitutional symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and medical and surgical treatments for breast TB. In all, 1,478 cases of breast TB were collected. Previous history of TB was reported in 19% of cases. The most common clinical appearance of the lesion was breast lump (75%). The most common associated finding was axillary lymphadenitis (33%) followed by sinus or fistula (24%). The most common symptoms were pain and fever, reported in 42% and 28% of cases, respectively. The most used diagnostic method was fine-needle aspiration cytology (32%), followed by biopsy (27%), acid-fast bacteria Ziehl-Neelsen stain (26%), culture (13%), and polymerase chain reaction (2%). These tested positive in 64%, 93%, 27%, 26%, and 58% of cases, respectively. The majority (69%) of patients received a 6-month anti-TB treatment (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Surgery consisted of excision in 39% of cases, drainage in 23%, and mastectomy in 5%. The great majority of patients had a positive outcome.

Two phase 2 trials of CYD-TDV measured baseline and month 13 PRNT50 titers: CYD22 (9- to 45-year-olds, Vietnam) and CYD47 (18- to 45-year-olds, India). 50% plaque reduction neutralization test distributions were compared between age cohorts, and four versions of an epidemiological bridging method were used to estimate VE against any serotype (dengue virus [DENV]-Any) and against each serotype over 25 months post first vaccination in a hypothetical CYD14 + CYD15 18- to 45-year-old cohort (bridging population 1) and in the actual CYD47 18- to 45-year-old cohort (bridging population 2). Baseline and month 13 geometric mean PRNT50 titers to each serotype were significantly greater in 18- to 45-year-olds than 9- to 16-year-olds for all comparisons. The four methods estimated VE against DENV-Any at 75.3-86.0% (95% CIs spanning 52.5-100%) for bridging population 1 and 68.4-77.5% (95% CIs spanning 42.3-88.5%) for bridging population 2. The vaccine efficacy against serotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 was estimated at 56.9-76.9%, 68.3-85.8%, 91.4-95.0%, and 93.2-100% (bridging population 1) and 44.5-66.9%, 53.2-69.2%, 79.8-92.0%, and 90.6-95.0% (bridging population 2), respectively; thus, CYD-TDV would likely confer improved efficacy in adults than 9- to 16-year-olds. Using the same methods, we predicted VE against hospitalized DENV-Any over 72 months of follow-up, with estimates 59.1-73.5% (95% CIs spanning 40.9-92.2%) for bridging population 1 and 50.9-65.9% (95% CIs spanning 38.1-82.1%) for bridging population 2.",Determination of Benznidazole in Human Dried Blood Spots by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry to Monitor Adherence to Trypanosoma cruzi Infection Treatment in Infants and Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115303,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 22,"Medication adherence is critical to the effectiveness of benznidazole (BZ) therapy for the treatment of Chagas disease. Assessing BZ adherence using traditional plasma sampling methods presents numerous challenges in resource-limited settings. Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling of BZ can be used to overcome logistical barriers and provides a less invasive method for assessing BZ levels. A BZ DBS assay using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed and applied to a clinical study of infants and children being treated with BZ for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Argentina. The assay was validated over a concentration range of 9.8-5,000 ng/mL. Inter-assay and intra-assay measures ranged from -2.9% to 2.7% and 0.5% to 8.3% for accuracy and from 3.5% to 12% and 1.6% to 13.6% for precision, respectively. The mean recovery of BZ was greater than 91%. Partitioning ratios for DBSs/plasma ranged from 0.95 to 1.02. A cohort of 10 infants and six children with T. cruzi infection being treated with BZ had median BZ concentrations of 1.2 (IQR 0.29, 2.14) µg/mL with seven of 65 (11%) samples above the BZ treatment goal of 3 μg/mL for adults. The reported DBS assay is a simple and accurate method for the quantitative measurement of BZ that can be applied to facilitate urgently needed clinical studies of BZ for the treatment of Chagas disease and assess BZ adherence in resource-limited settings.",A Monoclonal Antibody Specific for Japanese Encephalitis Virus with High Neutralizing Capability for Inclusion as a Positive Control in Diagnostic Neutralization Tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115302,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2019 05 22,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, and it is increasingly a global public health concern because of its recent geographic expansion.

To develop a reproducible positive control antibody useable in diagnosis of JEV infections, murine hybridomas were developed from mice inoculated with a combination of IXIARO JEV vaccine and JEV domain III of the envelope protein (E-DIII). Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were characterized for their ability to neutralize virus in vitro. Monoclonal antibody 17BD3-2 was found to be JEV specific and highly neutralizing, with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)90 endpoint titer of 1.25 μg/mL. The functional epitopes were mapped using virus neutralization escape variants to amino acid residues S309, K312, and G333 in E-DIII. This MAb may be substituted for human immune sera used as a positive control in PRNT for distribution to public health laboratories worldwide in potential future outbreaks of JEV."

Increasing numbers of producers are opting to use calf jackets as a means of mitigating the potential negative effects of low ambient temperatures, wind speed and precipitation on growth and health. This study aimed to use a range of noninvasive monitoring technologies to investigate the effects of using calf jackets in the first 3 weeks of life on calf performance and behavioural and physiological parameters. Ninety Holstein-Friesian calves were allocated to one of the two treatments: (i) Jacketed until 21 days of age and (J; n = 44) ii. Nonjacketed (NJ; n = 46). Calves were group housed and fed milk replacer (MR) and concentrate solid feed via automatic feeders. Calves were weaned at day 56, and the experiment was completed at day 63. Health assessments were conducted on a daily basis throughout the experiment using predefined faecal and respiratory scoring protocols. A range of novel, noninvasive monitoring technologies were used to examine the activity, heart rate and thermal profiles of calves on an individual basis throughout the experimental period. There were no differences in calf live weight (LWT), average daily gain (ADG) or feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in J and NJ calves between days 5 to 20. However, NJ calves consumed more MR and had more unrewarded visits to the milk feeder than J calves during this period. Although calf LWT was comparable across treatments in the week following jacket removal (days 21 to 28), both ADG and FCE tended to be greater in NJ calves. There were no treatment differences in calf LWT at the end of the study (d63). When measured over a period of 24 h and at a mean ambient temperature of 7.7°C, skin surface temperature was 6.37°C higher in J calves. Core body temperature was higher in J calves between days 5 to 20; however, there were no differences in IR eye or IR rectal temperature. No differences in lying behaviour occurred, with calves spending 18 and 17 h/day lying between days 5 to 20 and days 21 to 28, respectively. Under the climatic and management conditions described, no significant benefits to calf performance were found as a result of the provision of calf jackets to group-housed calves in the first 3 weeks of life. The higher frequency of unrewarded visits to the milk feeder in NJ calves during the first 3 weeks of life could be suggestive of a lack of satiety in these calves.",What has contributed to improvements in the child sex ratio in select districts of India?

The improvement was decomposed into: (1) less sex-selective abortion and (2) improved girl compared with boy mortality. Most of the improvement in child sex ratios were shown to be due to reductions in sex-selective abortion, although this still made up the majority of the cause of imbalanced sex ratios in 2011. Child sex ratio improvement has been happening in both rural and urban areas of India, and there is evidence of stagnation in mortality decline for urban girls.",Sows' preferences for different forage mixtures offered as fresh or dry forage in relation to botanical and chemical composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115283,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 22,"Providing forage to feed-restricted pregnant sows may improve their welfare by reducing their high feeding motivation. The aim of this study was to determine sows' preferences for four forage mixtures cultivated in Canada. Forage mixtures were compared when offered either fresh or dry. The four forage mixtures were composed of different proportions and species of legumes (alfalfa (Alf) or red clover (Clo)) and grasses (tall fescue (F) and/or timothy (T)): (1) Alf-F, (2) Alf-F-T, (3) Clo-T and (4) Clo-F-T. Voluntary intake was measured, and preference tests were carried out for two experiments: one in spring for fresh forages ( n = 8) and the other in autumn for hays ( n = 8) with different sows housed in individual pens and fed a concentrated diet meeting their nutritional requirements for maintenance and foetal growth. Voluntary intake was measured by offering each forage mixture separately (one forage mixture/day) during 90 min according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design replicated four times. During preference tests, all six combinations of two forage mixtures were offered once (one combination/day) for 45 min to each sow. Individual forage intake was measured, and feeding behaviour was observed. Forages were analysed for botanical and chemical composition. Difference in voluntary intake among the four forage mixtures was determined using a variance analysis followed by Tukey tests for post hoc comparisons. In preference tests, differences between the two forage mixtures offered were determined using a paired Student's t test, and the most ingested forage mixture was considered the preferred one. Results from both experiments revealed clear preferences for some forage mixtures when offered either fresh or dry. Forage mixtures with a greater proportion of legumes (AlfT and CloT) were preferred over forage mixtures with a higher proportion of grasses (AlfFT and CloFT). The AlfFT and CloFT forage mixtures contained at least 30% of fescue; therefore, the greater preference for the AlfT and CloT forage mixtures could also be due to the absence of fescue. Sows preferred forages with low DM and NDF concentrations and high CP and non-structural carbohydrates concentrations. Based on results from previous studies, the preferences seen in the present study are most likely due to the greater proportion of legumes, although an effect of tall fescue in preference cannot be excluded. Therefore, offering forages with a high proportion of legumes would be a good strategy to maximise both fresh and dry forage intake in pregnant sows.",Subacute Phase After an Earthquake: An Even More Important Period.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115282,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,2019 05 22,"ABSTRACTAn earthquake is a very common natural disaster. Numerous studies have focused on the acute phase, but studies concerning the subacute phase after an earthquake were very limited. This aroused more attention being paid to medical relief in the subacute phase, and this study elaborated on the division of the medical relief period and the definition of medical relief targets. More importantly, major types of disease were analyzed by reviewing the relevant published studies, which were identified by searching electronic databases. Findings suggested that the clear division of medical relief stage is vital for determining the priority of medical aid and allocating medical resources scientifically, and all concerned populations should be targeted for medical assistance. The focus of acute phase is injury (64.2%), and the subacute phase is disease (27.8% respiratory disease, 22.9% common disease, 12.5% wound/injury, 10.5% skin disease, 8.7% gynecological and pediatric disease, 8.5% digestive disease). However, due to the limited available studies, the included articles perhaps did not reflect the actual proportion of each type of disease. More studies are needed to better understand the proportion of different diseases in each phase of an earthquake.",A response to te Nijenhuis et al. (2019).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115281,Journal of biosocial science,2019 05 22,"Te Nijenhuis et al. (2019) cite studies that show that training on cognitive tasks produces the largest standardized gains on the easiest items and the smallest standardized gains on the most difficult items. They note that this creates an anti-Jensen effect, and use this as a trump that is supposed to show that my basketball examples are irrelevant. I use a new basketball example that is compatible with those studies. It assumes that at some point improvement on the easy skills 'stalls' - and all that is left is some improvement on the hard skills. Therefore, further environmental enhancement means the higher level skill gap is increased, which gives a classic Jensen effect, which shows that the presence of such does not entail genetic causality. The difference is that we really can produce virtually optimum basketball skills while for cognition, we are still well short. I also address the problem of why IQ gains over time do not show an anti-g pattern. After all, they are environmentally caused, and 'should' do so if an anti-g pattern and environmental causes go together.","Alterations of empathy in mothers with a history of early life maltreatment, depression, and borderline personality disorder and their effects on child psychopathology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115280,Psychological medicine,2019 05 22,"Early life maltreatment (ELM), borderline personality disorder (BPD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) have been associated with empathy deficits in different domains.

A total of 1080 pigs (initially 5.9 ± 1.08 kg) from three commercial research rooms were used to determine the effects of increasing standardized total tract digestible (STTD) P concentrations in diets without and with phytase on growth performance and percentage bone ash. Pens (10 pigs/pen, 9 pens/treatment) were balanced for equal weights and randomly allotted to 12 treatments. Treatments were arranged in two dose titrations (without or with 2000 units of phytase) with six levels of STTD P each. The STTD P levels were expressed as a percentage of NRC (2012) requirement estimates (% of NRC; 0.45 and 0.40% for phases 1 and 2, respectively) and were: 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 125% and 140% of NRC in diets without phytase and 100%, 110%, 125%, 140%, 155% and 170% of NRC in diets with phytase.

Materials & methods: 30 Wistar male rats were used to compare and characterize human PRP which was applied at the perilesional area in an acute wound model, evaluated by macroscopical and histological analysis. Results: Despite the increased growth factor concentration after the freeze-drying process, no change in the healing kinetics was observed in vivo. Nevertheless, a significant increased number of myofibroblasts was demonstrated in comparison with the fresh PRP group. We also demonstrated a significant increased percentage of blood vessels in comparison with controls in both the superficial and deep epidermis. Conclusion: These results encourage randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of freeze-dried PRP for skin ulcer treatment.","Real-world evidence of Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL) confirms pivotal clinical study results: 2-year outcomes of a retrospective, multicenter study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115257,Journal of endourology,2019 05 24,"Introduction This study expands results from recent Prostatic Urethra Lift (PUL) clinical trials by examining outcomes within a large, unconstrained, multi-center dataset. Methods Retrospective chart review and analysis of 1413 consecutive patients who received PUL in North America and Australia was performed. IPSS, QoL and Qmax were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-procedure for all non-urinary retention subjects (Group A) and retention subjects (Group B). Within Group A outcomes were further analyzed using paired t-tests and 95% mean confidence intervals under the following parameters: IPSS baseline ≥ 13, age, prostate size, site of service, prostate cancer treatment, and diabetic status. Adverse events, surgical interventions, and catheterization rates were summarized in detail. Results Compared to the L.I.F.T. pivotal study, subjects in this retrospective study were older and less symptomatic. Following PUL, mean IPSS for Group A improved significantly from baseline by at least 8.1 points throughout follow up. No significant differences were observed between Group A and B follow up symptom scores. Within Group A, subjects with an IPSS baseline ≥ 13 behaved similarly to L.I.F.T. subjects. Age, prostate volume, site of service, prior cancer treatment and diabetic status did not significantly affect PUL outcomes. When completed in a clinic office, PUL resulted in less side effects and catheter placement compared to other sites of service. Previous prostate cancer treatment did not elevate adverse events of high concern such as incontinence and infection. Conclusion PUL performs well in a real-world setting in terms of symptom relief, morbidity, and patient experience for all studied patient cohorts.",Analysis of Absorbable Hemostatic Packing Compared to Physiologic Hemostasis in Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery With or Without Septoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115256,American journal of rhinology & allergy,2019 05 22,There currently are no randomized studies examining if absorbable hemostatic packing (AHP) results in better objective and subjective outcomes than physiologic healing in sinus surgery with or without septoplasty.,G-CSF enhances the therapeutic potency of stem cells transplantation in spinal cord-injured rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115255,Regenerative medicine,2019 05 22,"Aim: The therapeutic effects of human wisdom teeth-derived neuronal stem cell (tNSC) cotreatment with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were evaluated for contusion-induced spinal cord injury in rats. Materials & methods: 7 days after contusion, tNSCs were transplanted to the injury site and followed by G-CSF cotreatment for 5 days. Behavioral deficits were evaluated by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan test. The injury site was collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan test significantly improved in the cotreated group compared with the tNSCs or G-CSF single treatment groups. However, inflammation indices did not differ among the three groups. In vitro experiment demonstrated that tNSCs express both G-CSF and its relevant receptor.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that G-CSF enhances neurotrophins secretion of tNSCs, and might help improving functional recovery from spinal cord injury in rats if they were given together.",Use of EHR-Based Pediatric Quality Measures: Views of Health System Leaders and Parents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115254,American journal of medical quality : the official journal of the American College of Medical Quality,2019 05 22,"Measures of health care quality are produced from a variety of data sources, but often, physicians do not believe these measures reflect the quality of provided care. The aim was to assess the value to health system leaders (HSLs) and parents of benchmarking on health care quality measures using data mined from the electronic health record (EHR). Using in-context interviews with HSLs and parents, the authors investigated what new decisions and actions benchmarking using data mined from the EHR may enable and how benchmarking information should be presented to be most informative. Results demonstrate that although parents may have little experience using data on health care quality for decision making, they affirmed its potential value. HSLs expressed the need for high-confidence, validated metrics. They also perceived barriers to achieving meaningful metrics but recognized that mining data directly from the EHR could overcome those barriers.

Although all patients with ischemic heart disease should be referred for cardiac rehabilitation (CR), whether patients with mental health conditions are willing to participate in CR programs is unknown. We sought to compare CR participation rates among patients with ischemic heart disease with versus without comorbid depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods and Results We used national electronic health records to identify all patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization at Veterans Health Administration hospitals between 2010 and 2014. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine whether comorbid depression/PTSD was associated with CR participation during the 12 months after hospital discharge. Of the 86 537 patients hospitalized for ischemic heart disease between 2010 and 2014, 24% experienced PTSD and/or depression. Patients with PTSD and/or depression had higher CR participation rates than those without PTSD or depression (11% versus 8%; P<0.001). In comparison to patients without PTSD or depression, the odds of participation was 24% greater in patients with depression alone (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.34), 38% greater in patients with PTSD alone (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.24-1.54), and 57% greater in patients with both PTSD and depression (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.43-1.74). Conclusions Among patients with ischemic heart disease, the presence of comorbid depression and/or PTSD is associated with greater participation in CR, providing an important opportunity to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes among these patients.",Equitable Thresholding and Clustering (ETAC): A novel method for FMRI clustering in AFNI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115252,Brain connectivity,2019 05 22,"This paper describes a hybrid method to threshold FMRI group statistical maps derived from voxelwise second-level statistical analyses. The proposed ""Equitable Thresholding and Clustering"" (ETAC) approach seeks to reduce the dependence of clustering results on arbitrary parameter values by using multiple sub-tests, each equivalent to a standard FMRI clustering analysis, to make decisions about which groups of voxels are potentially significant. The union of these sub-test results decides which voxels are accepted. The approach adjusts the cluster-thresholding parameter of each sub-test in an equitable way, so that the individual false positive rates (FPRs) are balanced across sub-tests to achieve a desired final FPR (e.g., 5%). ETAC utilizes resampling methods to estimate the FPR, and thus does not rely on parametric assumptions about the spatial correlation of FMRI noise. The approach was validated with pseudo-task timings in resting state brain data. Additionally, a task FMRI data collection was used to compare ETAC's true positive detection power vs. a standard cluster detection method, demonstrating that ETAC is able to detect true results and control false positives while reducing reliance on arbitrary analysis parameters."

The combination of the S. websteri nematode with 50 or 100 nematodes in oil emulsions of J. virginiana at 33% presented a control effectiveness of 80-100% in adult ticks 24 hr post-application. In field, the LC90 of 119 juveniles of S. websteri in oil emulsions of J. virginiana at 33% on domestic dogs presented an accumulated a control effectiveness of 89% after 96 hr post-application. The combined application of J. virginiana and S. websteri could be a good alternative for the control of ticks. It was observed that the time of contact and the type of vegetable oil were crucial factors to increase the effectiveness of control.",Photoacoustic properties of anterior ocular tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115200,Journal of biomedical optics,2019 05 22,"Clinical imaging techniques for the anterior segment of the eye provide excellent anatomical information, but molecular imaging techniques are lacking. Molecular photoacoustic imaging is one option to address this need, but implementation requires use of contrast agents to distinguish molecular targets from background photoacoustic signals. Contrast agents are typically selected based on a priori knowledge of photoacoustic properties of tissues. However, photoacoustic properties of anterior ocular tissues have not been studied yet. Herein, anterior segment anatomy and corresponding photoacoustic signals were analyzed in brown and blue porcine eyes ex vivo. Measured photoacoustic spectra were compared to known optical absorption spectra of endogenous chromophores. In general, experimentally measured photoacoustic spectra matched expectations based on absorption spectra of endogenous chromophores reported in the literature, and similar photoacoustic spectra were observed in blue and brown porcine eyes. However, unique light-tissue interactions at the iris modified photoacoustic signals from melanin. Finally, we demonstrated how the measured PA spectra established herein can be used for one application of molecular PA imaging, detecting photoacoustically labeled stem cells in the anterior segment for glaucoma treatment.",Cardiac Manifestations of Noonan Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115199,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 05 24,"Noonan syndrome NS, a RASopathy, is commonly seen in association with cardiovascular abnormalities, with structural defects and/or cardiomyopathy present in 80-90-% of cases. Though a wide spectrum of cardiac pathology has been reported, pulmonary stenosis is the most common structural abnormality and more likely to be seen in PTPN11 mutations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the second most common and is more often associated with RAF1 mutations. Cardiac disease tends to be more progressive in infants and children with NS and therefore close cardiology follow-up is indicated. In general, the earlier the presentation, the more severe the phenotype and worse the long term prognosis. As genotype phenotype associations are being better understood, the mechanisms for development of cardiomyopathy are also becoming elucidated, raising the possibility of medical therapies targeted at the involved pathway.",Endocrine Complications of Noonan Syndrome beyond Short Stature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115198,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 05 24,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a diagnosis that is made clinically based on features including typical facies, congenital heart defects, short stature and developmental delay. Approximately 50% of the patients have identified mutations in the PTPN11 gene, and a smaller percentage of mutations have been reported in other genes such as SOS1, RAF1 and RIT1 Despite normal birth length, patients typically reach adult height below normal. Other than growth, endocrine complications of NS are not as commonly reported. These include possible pathology in thyroid function, pubertal development and bone metabolism. Some investigators have looked to see if genetic mutations in these patients could pose a risk for future endocrinopathies. This chapter reviews reports on endocrine dysfunction other than growth in patients with NS. The information is meant to enhance awareness in those providers who care for these patients to the possibility of other existing endocrinopathies. Most importantly, it supports and highlights the endocrinologist's role in the care of patients with NS.",Growth and Growth Hormone Treatment in Noonan Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115197,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 05 24,"Short stature is a common characteristic of Noonan Syndrome (NS), a genetic condition caused by mutations affecting the RAS / mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Growth hormone (GH) has been used to normalize childhood growth and increase adult height in NS. GH is effective in increasing growth velocity, and significantly improves height SDS at adult height. Studies of GH treatment to adult height have shown height gains of 9.5-13.0 cm for males and 9.0 - 9.8 cm for females. Factors associated with improved height outcomes are earlier initiation of therapy, a greater height SDS at pubertal onset, and a longer duration of GH therapy. The safety data to date is reassuring and includes no evidence of adverse cardiac effects or increased occurrence of malignancies. Further studies will likely clarify the role of different RAS/MAPK pathway aberrations in growth and GH responsiveness.

RASopathies include Noonan Syndrome (NS), Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML/LEOPARD), Costello syndrome (CS), Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC), capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) and Legius Syndrome. These syndromes have many overlapping features; however, the most persistent feature common to all is the postnatal growth failure. The mechanism of growth failure in Rasopathies is highly complex and there are many proposed hypotheses including partial growth hormone insensitivity, growth hormone deficiency, neurosecretory dysfunction of growth hormone secretion, delayed puberty, poor feeding and skeletal abnormalities. Amongst these causes, the most widely accepted is partial growth hormone insensitivity due to a post-receptor signaling defect. Growth hormone therapy seems to be effective in improving height velocity in these syndromes, although the long-term effects on final height remain unproven. However, it is important to consider the potential risk of tumors and cardiomyopathy before and during growth hormone therapy.",Molecular Genetics of Noonan Syndrome and RASopathies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115195,Pediatric endocrinology reviews : PER,2019 05 24,"The RAS/MAPK signaling pathway plays an essential role in development and tumorigenesis by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and metabolism. Therefore, it is not surprising that germline mutations in genes encoding components or regulators of this signaling pathway cause numerous human genetic conditions, including Noonan syndrome and related disorders. The term ""RASopathies"" has been used to describe these disorders collectively due to their common underlying RAS/MAPK pathway dysregulation and overlapping clinical features. Taken together, the RASopathies represent one of the most common groups of genetic disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals. This review describes the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, summarizes multiple molecular genetic approaches used during the last several decades to discover genes responsible for different RASopathies, and finally focuses on several major disease genes associated with Noonan syndrome and related disorders with regard to genomic locations, structure, mutations, and genotype-phenotype correlations."

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare lung collapse after preemptive OLV versus conventional OLV in thoracoscopic surgery. A total of 67 patients were enrolled (34 with conventional OLV; 33 with preemptive OLV). Preemptive OLV was conducted by closing the DLT lumen to the non-ventilated lung immediately upon assuming the lateral position with the distal port closed to the atmosphere until pleural opening (>6 minutes in all cases). Lung collapse was assessed at 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 minutes after pleural opening using a 10-point rating scale (10: complete collapse). The primary end point was the duration from pleural opening to satisfactory lung collapse (score of 8). Secondary end points included PaO2 and hypoxemia. The duration from pleural opening to satisfactory lung collapse was shorter in the preemptive OLV group (9.1 ± 1.2 vs. 14.1 ± 4.7 minutes, P < 0.01).

The carbon catabolite repressor 4 (CCR4)-associated factor 1 (CAF1) component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex plays an essential role in mRNA deadenylation in most eukaryotes. However, while CAF1 has been extensively investigated in yeast and animals, its role in plants remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Citrus sinensis CAF1 (CsCAF1) is a magnesium-dependent deadenylase implicated in resistance against the citrus canker bacteria Xanthomonas citri. CsCAF1 interacted with proteins of the CCR4-NOT complex, including CsVIP2, a NOT2 homologue, translin-associated factor X (CsTRAX) and the poly(A)-binding proteins CsPABPN and CsPABPC. CsCAF1 also interacted with PthA4, the main X. citri effector required for citrus canker elicitation. We also present evidence suggesting that PthA4 inhibits CsCAF1 deadenylase activity in vitro and stabilizes the mRNA encoded by the citrus canker susceptibility gene CsLOB1, which is transcriptionally activated by PthA4 during canker formation. Moreover, we show that an inhibitor of CsCAF1 deadenylase activity significantly enhanced canker development, despite causing a reduction in PthA4-dependent CsLOB1 transcription. These results thus link CsCAF1 with canker development and PthA4-dependent transcription in citrus plants.",The radiological evaluation of posterior superior alveolar artery topography by using computed tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115150,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2019 05 22,Posterior superior alveolar artery (PSAA) is the most important limiting anatomic structure while lateral approach sinus surgeries.

To ensure longitudinal consistency and unbiasedness, we adopt a two-stage group-wise surface registration. To preserve sharp cortical attribute patterns on the atlas, instead of simply averaging over the coregistered cortical surfaces, we leverage a spherical patch-based sparse representation using the augmented dictionary to overcome the potential registration errors. Our atlases provide not only geometric attributes of the cortical folding, but also cortical thickness and myelin content. Therefore, to address the consistency across different cortical attributes on the atlas, instead of sparsely representing each attribute independently, we jointly represent all cortical attributes with a group-wise sparsity constraint. In addition, to further facilitate region-based analysis using our atlases, we have also provided two widely used parcellations, that is, FreeSurfer parcellation and multimodal parcellation, on our 4D infant cortical surface atlases. Compared to cortical surface atlases constructed with other methods, our cortical surface atlases preserve sharper cortical folding attribute patterns, thus leading to better accuracy in registration of individual infant cortical surfaces to the atlas."

MicroRNA-210-3p (miR-210), which is increased in the placenta of pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, miR-210 could inhibit trophoblasts invasion and might act as a serum biomarker for pre-eclampsia. Previous studies have demonstrated that miR-210 regulates HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell)-mediated angiogenesis by regulating the NOTCH1 signaling pathway. Studies by our group have previously identified that NOTCH1 plays a positive role in regulating trophoblast functions. However, the miR-210/NOTCH1 signaling pathway in the regulation of trophoblasts and pre-eclampsia has not been characterized. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the role of miR-210 and its relationship with NOTCH1 in trophoblasts. We first examined the expression levels of miR-210 and NOTCH1 in pre-eclamptic and normals placentas. Next, the expression and location of miR-210 and NOTCH1 in the first-trimester villi, maternal decidua, and placenta of late pregnancy were shown via in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo was used to investigate the effects of miR-210 on the expression of NOTCH1 and cell bioactivity by upregulation and downregulation strategies. The results showed that miR-210 expression was increased, whereas NOTCH1 expression was decreased in pre-eclamptic placenta compared with controls. Upregulation of miR-210 decreased NOTCH1 expression, impaired HTR-8/SVneo proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube-like formation capabilities, and promoted apoptosis. In contrast, downregulation of miR-210 resulted in the opposite effects. These findings suggested that miR-210 might act as a contributor to trophoblast dysfunction by attenuating NOTCH1 expression.","Knowledge, attitude, and practice of health care workers towards antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial stewardship programmes: A cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115129,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2019 05 22,"Antibiotic development was a major breakthrough in defeating infections; however, their vast use has led to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) causing mortality, morbidity, and financial burden worldwide.

White matter CVR was positively correlated with the global efficiency (coefficient: 23.3, p = .005) and local efficiency (coefficient: 2850, p = .004) of the connectome. Gray matter CVR was positively correlated with the global efficiency (coefficient: 21.3, p < .001) and local efficiency (coefficient: 2670, p < .001) of the connectome. White matter hyperintensity volume was negatively correlated with global efficiency (coefficient: -0.0002, p = .003) and local efficiency (coefficient: -0.024, p = .003) of the connectome. The association between CVR and the brain connectome suggests that impaired cerebrovascular function may be part of the pathophysiology of the disruption of the brain connectome in persons with white matter hyperintensities.",Self-Sorting Double-Network Hydrogels with Tunable Supramolecular Handedness and Mechanical Property.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115126,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 22,"Self-sorting, simultaneous and orthogonal operations occurred during the self-assembly of complex mixtures are commonly observed from biological species but rare in artificial systems. Herein, we designed two gelators (LPF and LPFEG), containing the same chiral core of phenylalanine but different achiral peripheral substituents, to give hydrogels with opposite supramolecular handedness individually. After mixing the two hydrogels together, double-network nanofibers with opposite handedness based on spontaneous high-order organization and self-sorting of these two gelators were observed. The chiroptical activity of the double-network hydrogels could be tuned by varying the molar ratio of LPF and LPFEG in the mixture, showing that the two gelators are highly independent of each other. Interestingly, an enhanced mechanical property was observed for the interpenetrating networks when the molar ratio of LPF:LPFEG was 3:7, presenting over 4-fold increase in both storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G"") relative to individual hydrogels at the same molar concentration of gelators.

Also, other complications such as ototoxicity and hepatotoxicity are a matter of concern. Today, it is suggested that cisplatin-associated toxicities are mainly induced by free radicals production, which will result in oxidative organ injury. The evidence is growing over the protective effects of antioxidants on cisplatin-induced adverse reactions especially nephrotoxicity. The possible protective effects of vitamin E and its derivative in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are reviewed here at the light of pertinent results from basic and clinical research. Administration of vitamin E alone or in combination with other antioxidant agents could cause amelioration in oxidative stress biomarkers such as decreasing the level of malondialdehyde, reducing serum urea and creatinine, and also enhancing the activities of renal antioxidant enzymes including renal catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase. Although the data from most of the studies are in favors of protective effects of vitamin E against cisplatin-induced toxicity, more clinical trials are needed to clarify the clinical importance of vitamin E administration as an antioxidant during cisplatin therapy in cancer condition.",Accuracy of clinical coding of pleural empyema: A validation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115122,Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2019 05 22,"Routinely recorded coding data are increasingly being used for clinical research, but the quality of that data is often variable.

Minimizing the exciton binding energy of the polymers can increase the yield of the charge carrier generation and thus improve the photocatalytic activities, but the realization of this approach remains a great challenge. Here, a series of linear donor-acceptor conjugated polymers have been developed to minimize the exciton binding energy by modulating the charge transfer pathway. The results reveal that the reduced energy loss of the charge transfer state can facilitate the electron transfer from donor to acceptor, and thus, more electrons are ready for subsequent reduction reaction. The optimized polymer, FSO-FS, exhibits a remarkable photochemical performance under visible light irradiation."

These are galactose-α1,3-galactose (αGal) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) which are introduced by the activities of two enzymes including α(1,3) galactosyltransferase (encoded by the GGTA1 gene) and CMP-Neu5Gc hydroxylase (encoded by the CMAH gene) that are inactive in humans but present in cattle. Hence, bovine-derived products are antigenic in humans who receive bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) or those that suffer from red meat syndrome. Using programmable nucleases, we disrupted (knockout, KO) GGTA1 and CMAH genes encoding for the enzymes that catalyse the synthesis of αGal and Neu5Gc, respectively, in both male and female bovine fibroblasts. The KO in clonally selected fibroblasts was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Selected fibroblasts colonies were used for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to produce cloned embryos that were implanted in surrogate recipient heifers. Fifty-three embryos were implanted in 33 recipients heifers; 3 pregnancies were carried to term and delivered 3 live calves. Primary cell cultures were established from the 3 calves and following molecular analyses confirmed the genetic deletions. FACS analysis showed the double-KO phenotype for both antigens confirming the mutated genotypes. Availability of such cattle double-KO model lacking both αGal and Neu5Gc offers a unique opportunity to study the functionality of BHV manufactured with tissues of potentially lower immunogenicity, as well as a possible new clinical approaches to help patients with red meat allergy syndrome due to the presence of these xenoantigens in the diet.","Membrane-based therapeutic plasma exchange in dogs: Prescription, anticoagulation, and metabolic response.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115107,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,2019 05 22,"Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is used increasingly in small animals to remove circulating large molecular products such as antibodies, pathogenic proteins, and protein-bound toxins.

However, there appear to be no systematic reviews of the relationship between L-VGCCs and stem cells, and filling this gap is prescient considering the contribution of L-VGCCs to the proliferation and differentiation of several types of stem cells. This review will discuss the possible involvement of L-VGCCs in stem cells, mainly focusing on osteogenesis mediated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from different tissues and neurogenesis mediated by neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs).

However, the cross-sectional approach does rely on an initial training data set to develop and calibrate the statistical methods to be used in cross-sectional surveys. The problem addressed in this paper is that the initial training data set may, over time, not reflect the current target population of interest because of evolution of the epidemic. For example, the mismatch between the target population and the initial data set could occur because of increasing use of anti-retroviral therapy among HIV-infected persons throughout the world. We developed methods to adjust the initial training data set with the goal that the adjusted data sets better reflect the target population. These adjustment procedures could help avoid the time and expense of collecting a completely new training data set from the current target population. We report the results of a simulation study to evaluate the procedures. We applied the methods to a dataset of HIV subtype B infection. The adjustment procedures could be applicable in situations other than cross-sectional incidence estimation where complex statistical analyses are to be conducted using an initial data set but those results may not be directly transportable to a new target population of interest. The approach we have proposed could offer a practical and cost-effective way to apply cross-sectional incidence methods to new target populations as the epidemic evolves.","A life course approach to total tooth loss: Testing the sensitive period, accumulation, and social mobility models in the Health and Retirement Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115080,Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2019 05 22,"Childhood socio-economic status (SES) has long been associated with later-life oral health, suggesting that childhood is a sensitive period for oral health.

Native Dutch speakers are a unique population to investigate this issue with because the configurational categories distinguished by staan (to stand) and liggen (to lie) are inherent in everyday Dutch language. Using an ERP component (N2pc), four experiments demonstrate that selection of posture verb categories is rapid (between 220-320 ms). The effect was attenuated, though present, when removing the perceptual distinction between categories. A similar attenuated effect was obtained in native English speakers, where the category distinction is less familiar, and when category labels were implicit for native Dutch speakers. Our results are among the first to demonstrate that category search based on verbs can be rapid, although extensive linguistic experience and explicit labels may not be necessary to facilitate categorization in this case.",To add or not to add a new treatment arm to a multiarm study: A decision-theoretic framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115078,Statistics in medicine,2019 05 22,"Multiarm clinical trials, which compare several experimental treatments against control, are frequently recommended due to their efficiency gain. In practise, all potential treatments may not be ready to be tested in a phase II/III trial at the same time. It has become appealing to allow new treatment arms to be added into on-going clinical trials using a ""platform"" trial approach. To the best of our knowledge, many aspects of when to add arms to an existing trial have not been explored in the literature. Most works on adding arm(s) assume that a new arm is opened whenever a new treatment becomes available. This strategy may prolong the overall duration of a study or cause reduction in marginal power for each hypothesis if the adaptation is not well accommodated. Within a two-stage trial setting, we propose a decision-theoretic framework to investigate when to add or not to add a new treatment arm based on the observed stage one treatment responses. To account for different prospect of multiarm studies, we define utility in two different ways; one for a trial that aims to maximise the number of rejected hypotheses; the other for a trial that would declare a success when at least one hypothesis is rejected from the study. Our framework shows that it is not always optimal to add a new treatment arm to an existing trial.

However, whether GLP can affect melanogenesis in melanocytes through regulating paracrine mediators that secreted by keratinocytes and fibroblasts is unclear. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of GLP in melanogenesis by regulating paracrine effects of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The effect of GLP on cell viability affected by GLP was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. After an immortal keratinocyte line (HaCaT) and primary fibroblasts (FB) were treated with GLP, the supernatants of HaCaT and FB cells were collected and cocultured with an immortalized melanocyte line (PIG1). The expression levels of melanogenesis-associated genes in PIG1 cells were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Furthermore, FRS-2, ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation levels were measured. Then, major melanogenic paracrine mediators in HaCaT and FB cells treated with GLP were evaluated by qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the expression of IL-6 and STAT3 was examined in HaCaT and FB cells. GLP was not cytotoxic to HaCaT and FB cells. The supernatants of GLP-treated HaCaT and FB cells downregulated the expression levels of MITF, TYR, TYRP1, TYRP2, RAB27A, and FSCN1 genes and inhibited the phosphorylation of FRS-2, ERK, JNK, and p38 in PIG1 cells. GLP also decreased FGF2 secretion in HaCaT and FB cells. Moreover, GLP reduced IL-6 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation in HaCaT and FB cells.

First, gene expression of Oct4, Sox2, and E-cadherin revealed the overexpression of Oct4 and Sox2 and downregulation of E-cadherin in HT29-ShE cells compared with HT29 wild-type and HT29-ShC cells. Next, Oct4-Sox2 complex decoy ODNs were designed according to their elements in the promoter region of Sox2 gene. Then, the interactions of Oct4 and Sox2 proteins to designed ODNs were evaluated in silico. Finally, DNA-protein interactions of decoy ODNs and their corresponding proteins were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Analysis of gel shift retardation assay admitted the specific binding of designed ODNs sequence to the nuclear extracted Oct4 and Sox2 proteins.

This study aimed to identify circRNAs acting as potential biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Research were retrieved from the articles published by September 2018 in eight databases to compare circRNA expression profiles between CVD and non-CVD in human and animal models. Meta-analysis under a random effects model was conducted. Subgroup analysis of tissue, species, and disease-specific circRNAs was examined. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explain the uncertainty among all studies. Diagnostic accuracy of circRNAs in CVD was analyzed to testify the discriminative ability. Bioinformatics analysis including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was conducted. Among 6,284 differentially expressed circRNAs from 32 original studies, only 322 circRNAs were reported in three or more studies. The meta-analysis identified 63 significantly dysregulated circRNAs, 44 upregulated and 19 downregulated. Among the tissue-specific or disease-specific circRNAs identified in the subgroup analysis, two circRNAs (circCDKN2BAS and circMACF1) showed the potential to be circulating biomarkers for CVD. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated 69% of circRNAs were in conformity with the overall analysis. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 2.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.35-3.58), and the overall area under the curve value was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.89). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that the target genes of circRNAs participate in cardiogenesis-related processes and pathways.

Methyl palmitate (MP) has demonstrated marked hepato-, cardio- and pulmonary protective features; however, its effects on ethanol-induced gastric injury have not been studied. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential gastroprotective activity of MP against ethanol-evoked gastric mucosal damage in rats and associated molecular mechanisms, for example, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways. The rat stomachs were examined in terms of the inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotic perturbations. Current data demonstrated that pretreatment with MP attenuated the gross gastric damage, scores of ulcer index, area of mucosal lesions and histopathology outcomes; actions which were similar to the reference antiulcer omeprazole. MP inhibited NF-κB expression, its nuclear translocation, and the expression of its downstream signals, for example, tumor necrosis factor-α and myeloperoxidase besides restoration of interleukin-10 levels. Western blot analysis revealed that MP counteracted the disruption of MAPKs signaling via lowering p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (p-JNK1/2) expression and restoring the phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) levels without affecting p-p38MAPK levels. Additionally, MP improved the antioxidant milieu via diminishing lipid peroxides and enhancing glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity and mucosal nitric oxide. In the context of apoptosis, MP inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and Bax protein expression with upregulating B cell lymphoma-2 expression (Bcl-2), thus, promoting gastric cellular survival. This was confirmed by MP activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway manifested by enhanced expression of PI3K p110α and p-AKT. Together, the present findings report the gastroprotective actions of MP mediated via its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic actions. The underlying molecular mechanisms involve, at least partly, the modulation of MAPKs, NF-κB and PI3K/AKT transduction.",Efficacy of a home-based platform for child-to-child interaction on hand motor function in unilateral cerebral palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115046,Developmental medicine and child neurology,2019 05 22,To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an action observation treatment (AOT) home-based platform promoting child-to-child interaction to improve hand motor function in unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).,Focal skeletal FDG uptake indicates poor prognosis in cHL regardless of extent and first-line chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115045,British journal of haematology,2019 05 22,"18 F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is used for staging classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) with high sensitivity for skeletal involvement. However, it is unclear whether a single bone lesion carries the same adverse prognosis as multifocal lesions and if this is affected by type of chemotherapy [ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine) versus BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone)]. We reviewed the clinico-pathological and outcome data from 209 patients with newly diagnosed cHL staged by FDG-PET/CT. Patterns of skeletal/bone marrow uptake (BMU) were divided into 'low' and 'high' diffuse BMU (i.e. without focal lesions), and unifocal or multifocal lesions. Additional separate survival analysis was performed, taking type of chemotherapy into account. Forty patients (19·2%) had skeletal lesions (20 unifocal, 20 multifocal). The 3-year progression-free-survival (PFS) was 80% for patients with 'low BMU', 87% for 'high BMU', 69% for 'unifocal' and 51% for 'multifocal' lesions; median follow-up was 38 months. The presence of bone lesions, both uni- and multifocal, was associated with significantly inferior PFS (log rank P = 0·0001), independent of chemotherapy type. Thus, increased diffuse BMU should not be considered as a risk factor in cHL, whereas unifocal or multifocal bone lesions should be regarded as important predictors of adverse outcome, irrespective of the chemotherapy regimen used."
